Lovely dinner with friends,"We ordered a cheese platter with three cheeses, mains and desserts. The cheese platter came with a bread basket, butter and chutney on the side. It was a great appetiser to share among three people. Out of all the mains the ravioli was our favourite. The staff were really friendly and helpful too! Overall a great dinner experience"

Visit themüëçüëçüëç,Its a very cozy place.the staff are very friendly and accomodating. I love their brunch its so deliciousüòò I recommend to everyone! I would like to come back here again and again
It‚Äôs just awesome,"Food is on the pricier side but tasty. Ambiance was nice and the French music was good too.
Order their coffee! I promise, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Good selection of French cheeses and French wines. Online menu wasn‚Äôt well accepted by the older folks but they do provide a hard copy menu. Service was fantastic, lot of greeting and welcoming smiles. Me and my parents were well taken by the team. They provided $1 free flow of premium water, support a cleaner planet and they mentioned half of the revenue will go for project tree planting in IndonesiaI suggest you reserve a good table online before you come. We will be back definitely. And big thanks to Shung, such a lovely person!"
Awesome brunch,Went for brunch with my bf on sunday. We love the ambianc and service was superb. We had the raviol and french toast we loved it. Our server melody was so cheerful and help us with the food recommendation. Kudos to the team its very rare to find a great service in singapre. Will be back soon:)
Pizza was great,Went in the evening where it was not very crowded. Did not have to Q in line. Pizza and coffee was great. Service was great too . Menu could have been more extensive with more choices.
Great service and friendly staff,"I wanted to look for a quieter place to read my book and chanced upon this cafe. The staff were very friendly. I chose and outdoor seating but when it got a bit hotter, one of the waiters offered the window seating inside and helped move my drink and bag in.

Would def come by again if I'm in the area!"
"Sadly, not charmant","I live locally to Merci Marcel, so I‚Äôve been a number of times since it opened. Along the way they have changed concepts from a casual French-Japanese restaurant to something closer to a cafe with all-day dining.

So, now it is Impossible Burgers and Mac and Cheese and Caesar Salad with Chicken. They still have a great wine list and full bar, but the menu has moved from chef-driven to easy-to-produce formula.

It is what it is, and sometimes a burger or salad hits the spot, but everything else went more casual with the changes, including the service.

There is really no excuse for bringing the meals out for a table with different timings, but the night we were there one us was served more than 15 minutes later than the others. That just annoys everyone at the table who is polite enough to wait until everyone is served before starting to eat.

Because it‚Äôs ‚Äúcasual‚Äù, that means servers standing in one spot and handing plates around, cutlery in a bucket and guests trying to intercept staff if you want your water refilled.

Again, it is what it is, but we actually sent a ‚Äúgreen risotto‚Äù back for being dry (and, to be honest, tasteless) and it was comped from our bill.

Another odd moment‚Ä¶ One of our friends was visiting from overseas and didn‚Äôt have data on her phone (because ‚Äúcasual‚Äù means QR-code menus) and the suggestion from our server was to use a neighbouring restaurant‚Äôs unlocked wifi because it would be ‚Äúeasier‚Äù.

I suspect that neighbouring restaurant, which has a similar menu, would have been a better dining experience.

I‚Äôm all for restaurants surviving, so I understand Merci Marcel‚Äôs decision to serve breakfast, brunch, lunch, afternoon coffees and dinners. I understand the mid-tier pricing and keeping it casual. I understand the menu changing to dishes which can be pre-prepped and don‚Äôt require much kitchen skill.

But, I think you can do that AND provide a reasonable dining experience. With the quality of the food and service, we thought this meal at Merci Marcel would probably be our last. Pity, because it was a great little local restaurant."
Best french cafe,"I brought my dad over for the 1st time, and it was a busy Friday lunch service. The host manage to accommodate us. we Loved the French toast and Beef burger. The coffee was great, too, with beautiful art. The ambience and service were great will be back soon :)"
First visit,It's my first visit here with my Friends. Love the recommendation from Felicia especially the truffle tarte flambee . Will bring my daughter here next time to try other dishes . I love the latte art done by Christian the Batista too .
Lunch,It's my friend and my first time here. We really enjoy ourselves and the food recommendations from Felicia is so good. Especially the Truffle tarte flambee. I love the patio area with all the plants. Definitely will come back to try other dishes.
Lunch,Brought my mother in law and her friend for lunch before their florist class . And they really enjoy themselves. Thank you for the great service from Gurprit and Melody . Also they love the latte art done by barista Christian . And they love the crossiants !
Great food and service!,Perfect place to start your day or to enjoy a nice meal with friends. The service was exceptional as well as the food. We‚Äôll be back!
Great breakfast spot,We ate breakfast here twice on a recent visit to Singapore. Great fresh food and well prepared. Recommend the cappuccino and any of the egg dishes.
Great Ambience with good food,Food was awesome! Staff Felicia was very friendly and bubbly. Also provided some recommendations for food which was very good. Tip: try their homemade fries! So yummy!
Amazing service and food!,Amazing service and food! The staff are very courteous and engaging which makes us feel very comfortable! Two thumbs up!
Fantastic service & Marvellous food,"The service by the crew were superb. Initially we had a table at the patio and a little warm. The crew moved us to the indoor dining immediately when there was empty table. The crew can remember all our plate n glass when shifting.
The food was served fast and fantastic. Will definitely go again."
Always Fab!,Food and service is as per usual excellent. Mugi is great with service and recommendations of wines.
So so close to being great,"Went on a Saturday afternoon. Very confusing menu but the staff were friendly so that was great! They were vey helpful in explaining the menu to us and we ordered in no time. Food was great but the coffee was really burnt. Had a flat white and it was over extracted. That was the only disappointing part of the meal. Other than that, wonderful experience!"
Good time,Great food.thank u Juirlyn the one who serve my food and is very nice and accomodating.be back with my family soon.
Food nice,Food damn nice bodoh yall try but if no money dont come ya food nice can bring ur mother father grandfather grandmother
Rustic but fresh,Melody has given us first class customer service. Please convey to the restaurant management our appreciations. Thanks We appreciate her Clear Communication and Friendly Attitude. ... 5 star customer service I would say.
French toast with honey,"What's French toast without honey , so extra honey for my toast . Not a whip cream person but this whip cream is very light unlike those I ate before and I actually love it . Love the vibe and service here ."
Overpriced and meager quality,"I like simple food with simple ingredients but a croque madame that's lukewarm, the cheese not really melted, with raw ham (why?) an egg on top that's overdone, no cheese sauce for 26 dollar .... pffff really - get your act together

Tiong Bahru is a trendy place but that doesn't mean you can overprice the food and deliver poor quality"
Friendly and sincere Felicia,"Celebrated a birthday there, had the striploin steak and ravioli for our mains. Felicia was patient with recommending wines to pair with our our cheese and ham. Highlight would be the birthday song Felicia sang for us! Really warm and friendly person :)"
friendly and warm welcome from Felicia!,"Best place to chill out, good food and nice wine. The best part is the friendly Felicia always help to explain and introduce us the best wine pairing with our foods . Will definitely come back again!"
Family dinner,Staffs were very friendly and outgoing. Best dish is their mac n cheese and truffle beef. Recommendedüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
Dinner,"Bravo to Gurpit & team @ TB Merci Marcel After work on Friday night, I enjoyed my dinner here recommend the Truffle Mushroom Pasta and Hampagne Brut!! Service was good. Tris G"
Not Fair,"Have always enjoyed Merci Marcel but last night was an utter disappointment. The white wine on display indicates the price as $73. Yet on check out we were charged $114 for the wine. This is 56% more than the display price!! When we enquire on the ‚Äúmistake on the bill‚Äù, we were then told that dine in price for wine is different from what is displayed. Firstly, we were told there is no wine menu with prices in the restaurant. We have to look at the wines on display and choose. Next, nobody told us anything about the wine's displayed prices vs dine in price. This is totally unethical and unprofessional. I do not expect a restaurant chain like Merci Marcel to conduct its business in this manner. This is really unfair to the customers."
Great place for tete a tete,"Met a friend for a catch up- she exclaimed : ""What a pretty place this is!"" on arrival. She loved the food and the staff was attentive and very helpful. I have been here several times and the standard of service and food is very consistent. Shall be working my way through the menu!"
Nice place for brunch,"My friend and I went to the Tiong Bahru branch for lunch last Saturday. We ordered poached eggs, tuna ceviche, french toast and creme brulee. All were very delicious!"
Yummy Dinner!!!,"Had a lovely dinner at Merci Marcel TB today. It was very busy at the restaurant but the friendly Gurprit managed to get 2 seats at the bar for us. We had the French Ratatouille, Ravioli, Mac and Cheese. They were delicious, as usual. Must not forget the Passionfruit Creme Bulee dessert! Yummy! Compliments to the Chefs!

Thank you to Mugilan and Shuang for your friendly and great service!

Looking forward to come back to restaurant!"
Relaxed Cafe style in a trendy Singapore Area,"Stopped here for a quick lunch time feed and catch-up with a friend. Never been before, so it was pot luck as to how it would all go.
The service was great, very well looked after, and they have $1 water which is unlimited refills, including sparkling, i liked this idea to be sustainable!

I had the beef, and my partner had the tuna, both dishes very nice, fresh, and tasty!

Thanks for the feed, coffee was good too!"
New pasta,"In love with the new Truffle and Mushroom pasta ! The truffle taste not overwhelming , and love the Mafaldine pasta . Unlike those usual spaghetti we eat outside. Definitely must give this a try !"
Terrible,"We love love Merci Marcel. Unfortunately we have the most disappointing experience this morning. The cafe was not very busy and we had to wait for 15 mins for our coffee. The only reason the coffees were served only because I had to walk to the bar, saw two cups of coffees lying on the bar - unattended, and asked for it to be served. You can tell that the coffee has been there left unattended for a long time as the foamed milk already disintegrated. This is terrible."
Excellent service and great food!,"Great food and ambiance! The staff were really nice and friendly. I would really come back again for the experience and food. Also, the raviole was so good. It is a must to order!!!"

Afternoon break,The ambiance is good . I love the French toast the most .. Enjoyed the new drink Ice Matcha Latte. Friendly staff!!!
Scrumptious Dinner,"Ordered the Mushrooms and Truffle Pasta and French Ratatouille. Athough the pasta used was a bit thick, on the whole, it was tasty yummy! And the Ratatouille, I can't get enough of it! I just want to keep eating it. Not a heavy dish. It is a slow cooked red & yellow peppers with onions with 2 poached eggs. Love the service provided by the staff!!! Very friendly!"
Wonderful food at Merci Marcel Tiong Bahru!,"Amazing food!! We really enjoyed the food and wonderful service :-) We ordered the marinated prawns, duck confit, ravioli, lemon pie. and it was so delicious! Thank you to Mugilan as well"

The place had such good vibes, and the service staff were friendly and accommodating. Shoutout to Melody, for her lovely recommendations! Swift with her service and pleasant personality. Must try -- the cheese platter (Petit Langres) paired with some smooth Pinot Noit to start the carefree Sunday afternoon. Highly recommended!"

Hens‚Äô lunch celebration,"We had the loveliest time at Merci Marcel for a hens‚Äô lunch celebration. The team here was so attentive to our needs from the moment we step through the doors (thanks Kid!). They set aside the patio area which was lovely and had lots of natural light. The food was good and we had such a great time! Thanks for the amazing service, would be inclined to come back to celebrate a special occasion or just to have brunch again :)"

Good service,"I must say that they have provided a very good service. We wanted to have a drink and cut a cake for my husband‚Äôs birthday. Not only they are welcoming, they even set the cake in a very nice plate. Felicia is extremely friendly and helpful. I will certainly come back again with more friends.

Keep up the good work Felicia and the team!"
Best cappuccino,"I have been in Singapore for two months. I have visited six cafes near Central Balilu. I happened to pass by this cafe. The environment is quiet and comfortable. The employees are very kind and enthusiastic, and several of them also know Chinese, which makes me communicate super bad without pressure. It's great! The cappuccino in this family is very mellow and delicious. The day before yesterday, there were other guests who wanted to change seats with me because there were so many people. It was OK. I didn't expect that the cafe would specially send me a cup of coffee to express my gratitude. It was a little accident! If it doesn't rain, this cafe is my must-see place for afternoon tea."
First visit for lunch,"Nice ambience, service staffs all very friendly especially Felicia. She is very friendly and make me feel the warmth. Photo she take all is so nice Food is really delicious, a good place to chill with our girlfriend. I really enjoy being here."

Highly recommend!,Love the truffle pizza and the Valentines day special dessert mix berries with Pistachio! Very good customer service & will definitely come again to try other food!
Bad main service,"Food was delicious (except the chocolate cake- a bit dry) but very disappointed by the main manager. Quite impolite, speaking like a machine more than a human, wanted to expedite as fast as possible our dinner, fortunately we had a very nice local waitress very gentle and smiling.
Maybe the manager needs a some holidays? Or change job.
Or please treat your customer as human being."
Nice Food and Ambient,Nice coffee and pizza. The ambience is nice and relaxing. The staffs are friendly and it is enjoyable to interact with them.
