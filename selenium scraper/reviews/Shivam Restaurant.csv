Good location and delicious food,I went to Shivam with some friends for dinner and was impressed with the flavorful vegetarian food and wide range of choices available. The atmosphere of the restaurant was also cosy and nice and the waiters were attentive. The restaurant is conveniently located just opposite Mustafa shopping centre. Would definitely recommend a visit.
Superb Masala Chai,"I was having Business Meeting at Shivam Restaurant , had their Masala Tea which I would recommend to all the Masala Tea lovers out there . The unique part in the Chai was the Cinnamon Stick AKA ""stirrer stick"" adding more Aroma to the Tea."
Good variety of food and food is delicious!,"They have wide variety of food that caters to different taste buds. The food is delicious too! We forgot to take pic before eating. They also have a lift to 2nd level as well, can host parties etc. Worth a visit!"
Great Food - Will visit again,Great quality vegetarian food. Wide varieties of menu to chose from. The food was flavour full & delicious. Portion size was value for pretty good. Friendly staff crew with excellent service. Overall a pleasant experience. Definitely will visit again.

Good vegetarian food,"I went with my friends, very good food, menu choices are many.. tried chole batura. Very tasty and I enjoyed"
Average restaurant,There are many good Indian restaurants in Singapore. This was average at best . Staff were ok but still a long way from 5 star service
Good vegetarian restaurant,"Visited this restaurant after seeing the review, tried punjabi thali. Food was food and I enjoyed the taste. Staff were courteous and recommended correct choices according to my requirements."
Disappointingly average,"Was expecting good things after all the 5 star reviews. I took the pani puri which is all about the flavour of ground spices in the water followed by the chana bhutura.

Service was prompt and speedy.

The food arrived and looked great. But it was at best very simple home style cooking, lacking any deep flavour and spices that you expect when you go dine in a restaurant.

While I was eating, the owner was sat 2 tables away and decided to make a phone call at the top of his voice, with no regard for his customers.

Tekka market has better food quite frankly!"
Mexican Pasta Sizler,"I always wanted to try the Italian food with a touch of indian flavour.. I tried the mexican pasta sizler and it was one of the best fusion food i had recently.. It was a combination of different pasta like penne spaghetti fuesli.. Loaded with cheese and tomato base with bell peppers corn mushroom olives and other veggies.. topped with herbs As this will be an overload of cheese the restaurant make sure that to reduce the quantity of the cheese. this is presented like a sizzler

Overall it is super Appetising and 1 portion can be shared by two individuals.. Itâ€™s a must try for all veggie pasta lovers"

The place to go for Indian vegetarian food.,"Had lunch at this restaurant which is located just opposite the Mustafa Shopping Mall. As Iâ€™m not familiar with Indian vegetarian food, I asked the owner to recommend. He asked about my food preferences and recommended 1) butter naan 2) Palek Paneer (spinach gravy with cottage cheese and 3) vegetable biryani (serve with some yogurt salad). We ordered fresh lime soda for drinks.

The recommendations were perfect as we enjoyed the dishes very much. They were tasty and not very oily, nice and healthy food basically.

There are many other dishes in the menu that we would like to try. Will visit again."

Awesome indian vegetarian food,"Interesting selections of Pure Vegetarian Gujarati, North Indian, Italian, Mexican to Indo-Chinese cuisine

My personal favourite would be their Naans. Chewy and crispy. Fragrant too. Generally all the dishes are flavourful enough yet not overly spiced. I love the Khaman Dhokla too, very interesting dish with a sweet savoury profile. The briyani is also surprisingly delicious! @shivamrestaurant is a good choice for people who wants variety, but do not like mock meat as there is no mock fish or mutton options for your curry etc. All real food."

Poor quality of food :(,"We went to this restaurant based on the good reviews, but were sorely disappointed at the quality of the food. Tried a variety of basics - chaat, puri bhaaji, paneer tikka, gobi manchurian - and also tried the undhiyo as they are known for Gujarati food. The food was not made with care, as flavors were lacking and seemed like the food was made in a hurry."
Nice Indian Vegetarian food,"I like Indian food, want to try different vegetarian food. My friend recommended this place, variety of menu choices. Tried indian set lunch, good taste and I enjoyed it."

Decent Indian food with authenticity from Gujarat,"Good service, excellent location for tourist and tired local shoppers from Mustapha Shopping Center.

Masala chai that packs a punch with flavour and cinnamon stick. Basic beers available in bottle, and they are reasonably priced.

As recommended by many here, the Vada Pav must be an interesting Gujarat street food, I guess. The bread is crispy, and the condiments are right. However, I feel the potato filling is salty.

Compared to Thali set from many top choices in this area, I would say it's average. But the dry Gobi Manchurian was spicy, sizzling and tasty.

We have just tried less than 10% of their menu; this restaurantâ€™s kitchen also serves vegetarian Italian and Mexican food. Perhaps, this is where their expertise is. Therefore particular food like Thalli was average. Then again, the taste is very subjective.

They should improve on the alfresco dining ambience since they have it. It looks dull for patrons who sit outdoor. In terms of food improvement, MSG should be reduced and increase the natural way of creating authentic Indian taste and punch. My whole family were gulping a lot water after the meal till midnight which we know due to the MSG.

I will be back nevertheless and this establishment do have a future in the vibrant F&B scene in Singapore."
