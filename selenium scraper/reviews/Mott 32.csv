Good food and services,2nd visit to Mott32. Ordered the cny set. A bit on the pricy side but quality and taste of food are good. Only found the noodle dish in the set a bit too salty. They offered to redo the dish after we reflected it. Service staff is top notch too.
Expensive but worth it,Located in the MBS mall this is a branch of the famous Hong Kong restaurant. Possibly some of the best duck and pork I have had in a long time. You need to reserve a duck for your table weeks in advance but its worth the trouble. The dining room is elegant and the service was superb. It's really worth the splurge.
Great food and good service,"Peking duck is a must! We love the charsiu, double boiled soup, crab vermicelli and string beans best! (We have other dishes which we like too). Dim sum selection at dinner was a bit disappointing and wished they have more traditional desserts."
Best festive dining place,Most restaurants are either overly crowded and limited service and food selection during festive period. Mott32 manage to deliver same good quality and excellent service. Really make it a place for all occasions
Roasted Duck at perfection,"Loved every single bite - will come again!!! Service was great food delicious, cocktails amazing. Price is very ok for what you get"
Loved their dim sums. Worth trying,"Really enjoyed their dim sums so will need to try their lunch where they will have a much wider range of dim sums. Also enjoyed the cod fish and crispy noodles, as well as their different Chinese teas.
Service was good though not consistent between the different staff but overall they give their best.
Enjoyed their ambience too. Beautifully decorated."
"Great food, service and ambience!","Here the first time for a birthday celebration and we both had a great time. The food were all really delicious and of great quality, which justified the higher price point. Loved the black cod!

We were seated at a cosy area away from the bigger tables, but had zero issues getting the staff's assistance as they were all very attentive. They also served us a complimentary dessert for the birthday celebrant :)

All in all a great experience; would highly recommend to visit for special occasions."
Good in overall,"We had Peking Duck there. It was good, however if you want it, make it very clear at the reservation, as it is not always available. One star less, because the duck was served before the starters. Restaurant has nice ambiance rather expensive"
Exotic Oriental Experience,Great food. The Peking Duck is a must but need to reserve in advance…would recommend at least 3-4 days in advance
Must try!,"Great ambience. Food is really yummy and good. Good size in terms of portion of food. A little on the pricey side, but for the quality, it is still quite worth paying for."
Absolutely great food! Service exquisite. Different than what I have been used to,"Best Chinese restaurant, gourmet approach, Michelin star quality. Everything clean and very very carefully served. Need to book the Pecking Duck for my next encounter"
(Not only) for Peking Duck lovers,"Mott 32 is a very good restaurant and they serve an excellent Peking Duck. The appetizers we had were great too and their menu offers so many other delicious things - we definitely will come back. The staff was friendly and the restaurant has a good atmosphere. The Duck is worth the money - we never had a better one. We reserved in advance and this is recommended. The staff noticed that we were there for an anniversary and so a nice greeting from the kitchen came - a delicious Litchi sorbet (which was perfect after the duck) Its not a restaurant for every day - but if we could, we would be there every week - we definitely will use every occasion to come back and are very much looking forward to it. Thank to the Mott 32 team!"
Mott 32,Excellent food and ambience with impeccable services. The variety and matching of food with the tea exceeded expectations.
Incredible Christmas eve dinner,"We came here for our christmas eve dinner and it was excellent. Have been to Mott 32 in Hong Kong many times and was looking forward to some top tier experience once more

Service was extremely good, very attentive, detail oriented and caring despite some special requests we had

The food was some of the best we had on our trip and was plentiful. In particular the black pepper shrimp in the claypot was a stunning dish and we also liked the dim sum selections.

Location is intimate, not too big, dark and well positioned within the MBS mall. They also have so many secluded, private dining rooms which give the place a special feel. To be honest it was so good we should have come back on our last night"
Delicious,"New Years Day we dined at the world famous, Mott 32.
The name “Mott 32” pays homage to 32 Mott Street in New York, where the city’s first Chinese convenience store opened in 1891. The store served as the nucleus for what is now part of NYC's vibrant Chinatown.

One signature dish is the Smoked Black Cod (or plant based cod!) that is sliced and coated in light batter, fried until golden then tossed over high heat in a tangy sauce before being smoked. Entertainingly served to your table under a cloche that is expertly lifted by the waiter, leaving a trail of swirling smoke. Paired with a signature cocktail and some equally delicious mushroom dumplings, this meal really was delightful and a fantastic start to the New Year!"
Birthday celebration,"Chinese fine dining Restuarant with attentive staff and particular focus on distinctive taste of their dishes. I highly recommend their Peking Duck, deep fried pumpkin wrapped in salted egg, poach rice in seafood soup, BBQ pork and chicken with truffle sauce. Do take note that you have to order the Peking Duck 2 days in advance. Cheers"
Best Char Siu,Excellent food & impeccable service. Superb vegetarian choices. Highly recommend this place for dimsum & must try the Iberico pork Char Siu.
Good dinner,"Seventh visit, the sticky black cod, mustard yuzu sauce was almost good, but this time the meat a bit too soft. The wild mushroom, water chestnut dumplings and the soft quail egg, iberico pork, black truffle siu mai were above average. Friendly customer service."
Amazing Restaurant and great location,"It was our first time at Mott 32 and we will definitely dine here again on our return to Singapore.
It was NYE, we chose from the al la carte menu, huge variety especially if you love seafood, portion sizes were generous, and the meal was delicious. There was plenty of atmosphere in the restaurant and NYE hats, poppers, tiaras etc. were given to guests. The staff were very friendly, and attentive as required, we were not rushed to leave, so it appeared that our table was not booked after us, so we could relax and enjoy the dining experience and ambience."
Birthday celebrations,"We had a great time. The Peking duck, bbq pork, cod fish is so well done. Service is attentive. Overall very satisfied with the quality and taste of food. Also thank you for the special birthday dessert complimentary on the house. Highly recommend if you are looking for a place for celebration, gathering with friends and family."
overpriced average food packaged as luxury,"it didn’t taste bad, but not memorable and there’s nothing that seemed worth it’s price. Perhaps the black truffle siu mai was the only stand out dish."
Great food and service,"Had soup dumpling, hargow, beef puff pastry, duck bun, and wagyu noodles. All were delicious! Service was great too."
Best black truffle vegetarian dumpling,The best black truffle vegetarian dumpling in town. The customer service is excellent and nice ambience
Pleasant dining experience @ Mott32,"A very pleasant dining experience at Mott32 @ MBS Singapore... Service was attentive and the a wide variety of dishes were available... something for everyone, seafood, meat and vegetarian dishes.

We ordered the Peking duck and steam fish as our highlight. I particularly liked their chili sauce as well.

I was a bit disappointed with the fried chicken with maotai as I had a similar dish in HK @ Grand Majestic Sichuan and the whole chicken was so tender with elevated moutai fragance (although it was more pricier... 4x). Here, @ Mott32, they just poured a minute dash of the wine in the chicken (standard serve) and mixed it in a claypot without the flambee act... yes, some may argue it is more for social media posting or video but part of the price that you pay here is for the environment and presentation.

Pricing I think was very fair being positioned as a high end Chinese restaurant at MBS.

A note to compliment our waitress that night as the service was quite attentive.

Just a reminder that if you need to confirm any dishes or have any special requests, it is best to call the restaurant as they do not acknowledge/reply emails timely, if at all (in my case)."
Christmas Eve Dinner,"From the reception to the table, ordering, served my dinner, payment and then leaving the restaurant, it is such a busy night. But I get still get too service from the staff. They are so attentive and polite. It makes it a wonderful night to celebrate Christmas.

All the recommended dishes are great. Especially the smoked cod fish that goes so well with signature crab meat fried rice."
Will be back,"Wonderful dinning experience and friendly staffs, food is good, service is great. Will be back to try other dishes and drinks."
Mott 32 Dinner,The food was great as always same standard as in Hong Kong. BBQ Pork & Crispy Pork are a must. Chinese Tea is perfect. Love the atmosphere and staff are friendly.
Mott 32 dinner,All the food was amazing especially the duck and the Wagyu. The cocktails were ok but not much in them. Very intimate atmosphere. Definitely not cheap but a good experience.
Perfect food,"Its very nice restaurant and the food was very deliciouse especially the peking duck, bbq pork and roasted pork belly. Excelle"
5 stars,"Very good food, beautiful restaurant and attentive staff service. 5 stars for everything. Love the ambience . IBBQ iberico pork is a must order and the best char siu we’ve eaten."
Lunch treat,So grateful to the service staff who took all the effort to find a table for my group of 5. Appreciate the good food recommendations… truly give us a satisfying and enjoyable lunch experience!
Dining with friend,"I love the crispy bite size pork, Highly recommend for tourist friends who love to try high end chinese food like duck, pork and sea foods"
"Serving time, staffs, foods are nice",The staffs are nice and knid. All dimsums I ordered are delicious even the food looks very appetizing ^^ mouthwatering visuals 🤗 serving time is also good
Mott32 is a Must,Mott 32 is a culinary and sensory wonder. Love the food and the decor. Make sure to pre-order the Peking Duck and the iberico pork char sui
Attentive staff,Very good food. Attentive staff.. help us change our rice in fish soup to a smaller portion ( not available in menu) without us asking for it.
Pre Musical Dinner @ Mott32,"After trying a few calls to book for this dinner slot (and thankfully secured a lounge table reservation), I must say it’s well worth the effort. The service and food quality is impressive and the proximity to the theatre is great. Ambience wise was wondering is it necessary to be on the darker side, and amused by the blend of east and west. The food is unmistakably Chinese-Hong Kong with interesting twists here and there. Will definitely recommend friends to come by and perhaps a second visit for myself to try the food items requiring advance booking."
Food and service excellent,The food is excellent. The staff is friendly and well train. I like the part where the staff able to explain the food in the menu.
MBS fine dining Chinesee,"Reservations must be made 2-3 months in advance or early dinners at 5 pm. Excellent ambience with great melt in mouth peking duck, roast char siew. Excellent for expat client entertainment. Intimate environment with a large bottled selection"
Great !,We were there for our anniversary. We had a lovely afternoon there with good food and nice ambience.
"Please someone, answer the phone/ email","Hi there, I have no choice but to bring it onto TA. My mom made reservations for my birthday dinner on 11 Nov for 6 Dec, and have sent in multiple emails and called everyday for a week to modify the booking from 4pax to 6pax and to preorder the famous Peking duck. Today she received a confirmation email via Sevenroom and the confirmation still states 4pax. We do not want to make it troublesome on the day should 6pax show up, and took to liberty to make sure restaurant can prepare ahead.
I really hope someone can reply here. Not sure where else I can turn to.
Thanks in advance!"
Great Peking Duck and Chinese food.,"If you like Peking Duck you should try because it is very nice, Although it is hard to book a tablè but it is worth to visit and have experience with Mott32."
Wonder food and service at Mott 32,"Food is amazing . And the cocktail hanami you definitely have to try , I don’t like all the ingredients inside but when they mix tgt boom the best cocktail ever :) and the service is superb , they treat everyone like VIP. My favourite restaurant in town"
Good duck - not great,We felt not enough of the duck was sliced and offered to use with pancakes. The rest of the duck was used to prepare the second course which was very dry. The appetizers were delicious and the service attentive.
The worst fine dining environment I have ever been to. Horrible management to say the least.,This is the worst experience we have had in a fine dining restaurant. The restaurant manager and staff made no attempt to position a family with a screaming toddler to a quieter corner and our entire meal felt eating in a room with a non stop chorus of crying and screaming. The worst ambience for what should have been a good experience to start an evening.
Amazing Food!,This place was recommended by a friend and the food was simply amazing! I recommended it to my other friends and they were in awe as well. The service was great and the whole pecking duck price was reasonable. Can't wait for my next visit!
Fantastic Experience,It was a great experience celebrating my mother birthday and food quality is awesome. I will be looking forward to my next visit again.
Consistent quality of food,Nice atmosphere and ambience. Could use a bit more lighting to view the menu as the menu word font size is too small to see especially for seniors.
Good,"The dark is very good the price is reasonable. Services good, environment good. The soup is Overprice."
Great ambience,"We were given a good table. We ordered the signature duck, dim sum platter and the Yi Fu Mein which was not in menu. Everything was great!"
Mott 32 my Fav,Love the food and ambience. Waiting for the day I decide to pop the baby - Lafite Rothschild. Love the bespoke cocktail when asked and a bunch of outstanding friendly and professional servers and chefs.
Dinner,Great food and great atmosphere. The seat could be more spacious though. Will be back to try other dishes.
Awesome birthday,We enjoyed the set and the lovely attention to detail. Great food and cocktail. Thank you for the wonderful experience
nice food,"The food was nice , but there is time limitation, one hour 45 min. When the food served to us was delayed , the time given to us to finish the food was very rushed."
Yummy Duck,"Must placed a pre-order for their duck and pork belly when making your reservation. Otherwise you will not get any when you order at the table. It is delicious and one duck can serve up to 4 pax and served in 3 ways of cooking. I have the crispy skin (without the usual layer of fat underneath it), duck meat wrap with superb delicate spring roll skins warmed up in a dim sum steamer. The final dish from the duck is fried and eaten with lettuces. Don’t miss it whether you like to roast duck or not."
Delicious,We have a great blast dining in. The food is really appetizing and delicious. Love the ambience of the place. Highly recommended!
Good dinner,"Sixth visit, the signature smoked black cod was good, really enjoyed this dish with plain rice.
The soft quail egg, iberico pork, black truffle siu mai was above average.
The shredded Peking duck spring roll was just okay,a bit too salty for me, not to repeat order next time.
Ambience okay and friendly customer service."
Yummy cocktails and a great ambience,Great cocktails and friendly staff. Pleasant surprise for a quick cocktail drop-in. Looking forward to the full dining experience in future.
Modern Chinese with good cocktail and ambience,One of the very few good Chinese restaurants with good cocktails and ambience. Great to be able to have dim sum in the evening and the dim sum platter offers a good way to sample for each diner. Our favorite was the jelly fish and frog legs (two separate dishes) which we order every time we visit. The roast pork was changed from iberico pork to pork neck but was still good. Many diners ordered the Peking duck but we skipped it as we wanted to try something different from other Chinese restaurants. Instead we had the steamed garoupa which was not special but done properly. The egg white sesame dessert was one of the best among Chinese restaurants.
Fabulous meal for last night in Singapore,"Lovely restaurant, although the lighting could be a bit brighter. Great selection on the menu, the staff were very helpful. It was quite expensive, but no more than most high class restaurants around Singapore"
Duck and Much More,"Best Duck I have had in years plus great pork and vegetable dishes. The restaurant lived up to its billing! Quite nice place to have food done uniquely but deliciously! The service was great, friendly and they explained the dishes and advised on any issues. All in all a great first visit!"
Superb food,High quality food and insanely delicious. Staff are friendly but their service is slow. Serving between dishes took a minimum of 15 mins. Bill took a long while to come as well. Can definitely improve.
Excellent service staff,The service standard provided during my visit created memorable dinning experience. Appreciate your above par service Mott 32 !
Not what I was expecting,"When we got there the place was almost empty. For some reason we were seated right next to a server station. Noise from this the whole meal. First thing to come out was the squid. Lightly breaded and fried with some kind of dry topping on it. They never explained what it was. We ask if there was a sauce that was supposed to come with it and the server said no. It needed something to accompany it. I ordered the pan seared Wagu, and my wife had the Lobster Mapo Tofu. With these and a few other sides the meal and the ambiance should have been better for this kind of dining experience. The server was very attentive to our needs (we were night next to their station)."
Great Food!,Food and ambience were great! Have to try the Peking Duck and the Iberico Pork Belly (Do Preorder in advance..!)
Yummy Peking Duck,Tried two weeks ago and decided to go back again because it was really good. Staff are very attentive too.
Overall pleasant,Amazing Pekin duck. Make sure to reserve the duck ahead of your visit. Comes in 2 preparations. Nice selection of appetizers and the hot and sour soup was one of the best I’ve ever had.
Lunch @ Mott32,"Tried the executive lunch set. The food was yummy and portion was just right. Servicing staff was very attentive to us. We were advised what each servicing was. Will definitely go again and try out their other dishes. Yummy food, fantastic ambience and fabulous gathering!"
Wonderful experience,The Peking duck was delicious. We also tried a variety of dim sum. Happy with the dining experience and the staff were friendly.
Great Service & cosy environment,I have dinner with my friend last Friday and the food is great. The service staff is excellent and attentive to my request. This is my 2nd time dining at this restaurant and will continue to bring my family and friends over to dine again.
Great food and immaculate service,"Great food, immaculate service. It was a birthday lunch, which we thorougly enjoyed. It was a pity we didn’t get to try the Peking duck whick requires advance reservation of at least 1month. Till next time. =)"
Excellent food and service,"First time visiting Mott32 for birthday celebration. This place is not overrated at all, excellent food, dessert and service! Will definitely come back and try the cocktails next time! Yaya is super attentive! Great service!"
Great vibe and food,"Overall very nice vibe, food was excellent and service was excellent. Definitely recommend preordering the Peking duck , crispy skin was cooked perfectly."
Love this dining experience.,"Bought some overseas friends and local friends for dinner. Service staff Christine took my booking on the phone, was very pleasant and helpful. Unfortunately when we din that day she was on leave. Never the less the other service staff was also amazing. Courtesy, jovial, helpful.

It was a very impressive dinning experience. Food, taste, presentations was good, price maybe a little on the high side but is worth it.
Thank you mott 32 with so attentive staff."
Quality food,Sec time visiting this restaurant. Will definitely go back again. Must try their smoke cod fish 👍🏻
Fabulous tasting food,"Their Peking Duck is the best, the skin just melts in your mouth. Their crispy squid is garlicky with a hint of chili, and is crunchy and delicious. The crunchy pork belly, while a bit small, was also good, as well as the Iberico Char Siew which is so soft and velvety in the mouth.

The Bamboo Green Forest dessert was tart, and helps balance out the richness of the food.

The staff were attentive, and I loved that they always check on how our experience is going at different points in the service. Shoutout to the manager who was a delight.

It is not cheap, but well worth the price for the quality of ingredients and the taste.

I will surely come back here."
A delicacies in the tumultuous MBS,We did the a last carte menu and it was delicious. We have to come back for the Peking duck with friends to share it! The staff was attentive and service fast.
Great food,"Overall is good, of cos it is pricey, dessert can improve. Menu selection can be wider. Love the unique Peking duck."
Nice ambience & food,"Preordered the Apple Wood Roasted 42 Days Peking Duck “Signature Mott 32 Cut, enjoyed that. We asked for the meat to be made into a second dish for $28, fried rice.

The Braised Eggplant, Minced Pork, Chili Peppers was also very flavourful.

For dim sum, the South Australian Scallop, Prawn, Hot & Sour Shanghainese Soup Dumplings was interesting but a acquired taste & I enjoyed the Wild Mushrooms, Water Chestnut Dumplings which can be found at other dim sum restaurants as well.

Overall a good experience, with fast and good service."
When you want both food and service in a Chinese restaurant.,"I usually avoid Chinese restaurants. The food is often good, but the dishes are thrown at you, something I would rather avoid when I want to be pampered. The Mott32 is different. They know how to relax and serve your he best food.

I was there only a few minutes when I told my wife that we should have ordered the Peking duck which needs a 24-hour pre-oder. Anyway, we settled for their Singaporean Chilli Crab. The manager, Tad, noticed a mistake with our dish and apologised for it. He got us a second crab. I loved that honesty. They won a client for life. I will be back there, especially for that duck."
Truly recommended,"An outstanding experience with outstanding food and our server (Kylie) was very knowledgeable, patient and friendly. An overall superb experience"
MBS,"excellent food as always with great service also. good variety and beverages, lovely atmosphere for dinner or lunch ... food is always exemplary to the mouth"
Good dinner,"Fifth visit, the sticky black cod was good and the premium dim sum platter was above average. The siu mai was good but the Shanghainese soup dumpling was a bit too hot for me. Ordered exactly the same dishes as the fourth visit, but this time two sets of dim sum platter. From the first visit to now, my main dish is either the sticky black cod or the signature smoked black cod. Probably it is time to change to something different? But rather difficult not to order the black cod because they are good and quality pretty consistent.
Good customer service as usual.

This is my new account, same name and picture as the previous one. My first visit here was in October 2021."
Excellent Service But...,"We booked in advance and had the chance to have their duck and iberico pork. I have dined at the HK branch and for some reason, their Singapore branch was not as good, in terms of the food. The tih kwan nim (tea) was slightly over boiled and lacked the subtlety. The iberico pork was also over-cooked (or roasted, perhaps). We also had a difficult time understanding the server. Good thing the supervisor was quick to step in and save the day."
As good as in HK,Friendly and helpful with amazing choices in drinks and food with a nice ambience. Brought an overseas visitor and she was impressed.
Soul food at MBS,Always a favorite! Iberico pork and roast pork are the best! Yuzu cocktail was the one i forgot to order and that cocktail is refreshing af!
Amazing Experience at Mott32,Food and service rendered are awesome! great plant-based food options! My favourite dining place for friends and family!
Excellent ambiance and nice food,Very nice ambiance. Cocktails are fantastic. Good food. Wish we had pre ordered the duck as it looked good.
Nope.,Tries too hard to be a trendy interpretation of cantonese food. Service was painfully slow and prices were just unpalatable. I think most folks are tired of the clubby vibe thing. Just serve good food with good service and you will have your customers. This place does too little of either.
Best Chinese food in sg!,"Went for my birthday. Fourth visit in the last three months! We did a company visit, trip with hubby, another trip with hubby, and this birthday celebration trip! They’re the best Chinese restaurant I’ve been to. The pastry is perfection. The lobster fried rice is to die for. The cocktail is well balanced. The string beans with wagyu pieces is decidedly delicious. Great service. Amazing ambience! Delicious hot sour soup dumplings - they burst in your mouth - with spicy bite and full flavour! Omg I love this place. Nothing oily. Textures just perfect. You can taste the love and pride in each bite"
Good wine recommendation to go with the food,"We were there for pre-event dinner. I liked it that the lady who took our food orders was able to recommend against proceeding with my wine selection in view of our the food we had ordered. She recommended another wine, which ticked the boxes for what I wanted to drink."
Excellent venue for special occasions,"Food standards are consistently high & service staff never failed to be attentive & pleasant, comfortable ambience with jazzy music 😀 👍"
Anniversary Dinner,"Went Mott 32 for our anniversary, warmly welcomed and seated at a grand scenic dining room with limited seating. Recommendations and service by staff and server was excellent. A pity the duck was limited and not in the menu. Nevertheless the experience was amazing. Definitely will visit for the duck! Highly recommended with reservations made in advance. Thank you Mott 32 for the experience, we enjoyed ourselves!"
Memorable Birthday Dinner,"Took my mother to celebrate her birthday here. Friendly, welcoming and attentive service by our server for the night, Yaya. She presented my mum a complimentary birthday dessert.

We are not fans of cod fish but the Smoked Black Cod was so good, we will be back for more. Do get your camera ready, the waiter will prompt you when he serves the cod. The char siew was very soft and tender, melts in your mouth. The lobster fried rice was served piping hot and was very comforting on that rainy evening. The hot and sour dumplings were a nice change from the usual ones we usually have.

Ambience wise, it was quite dark/dimmed but we are not fans of bright lights so we enjoyed the atmosphere. Tables were also quite far apart so there was privacy when we conversed. Only gripe was the soft techno music that was played over and over and over again.

Overall, the food, ambience and service was 10/10. My mother enjoyed her dinner and was happy so the money spent was well worth it."
Birthday,"I am very satisfied with the service rendered, cosy and friendly envoirnment, all the staff are friendly"
Great charsiew!,"Awesome - great customer service, great food, great ambience - everything was good! Baby chair was awesome too!"
Great food and excellent service by Ruga,i'm not a duck lover but their apple smoked duck won me over. Claypot brinjal is nice as well. Have to give a big shoutout to Ruga who served us. Excellent product knowledge and service. He even went down on his knees to help find my earbuds below the table. Will definitely recommend this place. But do remember to order the duck in advance.
A definite must,"My wife and I had 6 nights in Singapore a different restaurant every night. Mott 32 winner hands down. Food, wine and service levels impeccable."
Bad taste of service,"For an award winning brand, I thought when we went to the Mott 32 Singapore branch, it would be the same Michelin star experience as it was with its more decorated branches.

One of the waitress “cleared the table” while we still have food on it and actually wiped with a towel. (Shocked this happened).

Not sure with anyone out there, but this isn’t a Hawker Center where time is limited and even so, you wouldn’t disrespect your guests like that.

We paid good money (about USD300 for dinner) for the food, ambience and actual “service”.

The proper etiquette rule remains in effect: The table should not be cleared until everyone at the table has finished. What a disgrace this staff showed. Knowing that Mott 32 actually originated from its humble beginnings in New York, paying homage to 32 Mott Street in New York, where the city’s first Chinese convenience store opened in 1891.

Disappointing. Proves its second rate."
"Very extremely tasty food especially the Beijing duck, crispy salted egg pumpkins and prawns. Seafood‘Pao Fan’ spr yummy",Excellent food prepared by the kitchen crew n service crew very attentive. Great and cosy ambience but the lightings are too dim n menu scripts are small.
Good quality food,Book through email and get prompt response within that night. Service is prompt and food qualitY is good.
