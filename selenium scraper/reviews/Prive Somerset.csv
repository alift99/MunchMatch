Great for big group,"I needed to book a group of 13 with no strings attached and each paying for our own. Most restaurants in town require huge deposits and minimum spending, but not Prive. We could each order our own food and pay for our own meals. Something most restaurants won't do. So thank you for being so accommodating."
great location,"staff friendly and helpful, food decent and plentiful, a little on the pricey side, but you do get what you pay for."
A Great Dessert Experience‚Ä¶,We had a fun time revisiting Prive Somerset. Elaine took our orders once again and made us feel warmly welcome. The drinks and desserts came quickly and the quality was top notch. We‚Äôll certainly return. Soon!
VERY BAD ATTITUDE AND RUDE STAFF,"I made a reservation for six pax at Prive. i asked for the bill of the whole table and I paid. I left and 2 hrs later, i received a few missed calls and it was Prive who called to say that not the entire payment was made because his staff did not combine and merge the tables in the system. Fine. I went back to make payment although I was really sore that I had to make an additional trip back to Prive again. Bear in mind that at this point, there was NO APOLOGY made for the inconvenience due to their mistake. When we got there, we paid up and the MANAGER commented ‚Äúyou should have checked the bill before you left‚Äù. This comment was completely unnecessary! We were not even complaining for making a trip back and yet, such a comment was passed which made us really mad. It was a MISTAKE ON YOUR PART, There was NO APOLOGY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE and we had to bear such a sarcastic remark.

We were definitely not pleased and he could see it on our faces and he still showed his attitude back to us. Ridiculous! Is this how you train your staff Prive?! You could do better.."
Enjoy the vegan foods with family..,"So far so good for the vegan small bites and mushroom soup, but pizza taste normal, thin base not crispy enough. Overall still good for the food and service, will surely recommend to friends."
Great service staff,Service is superb. They were very attentive and quick to assist. However price point was on the high side and menu selection was quite limited.
PriveSomerset,My first dining experience here at Somerset outlet. The service is excellent.. all the Staffs treated us with respect & excellent service! Am impressed.. thank u !
Prive somerset,Service is fast and very initiative. 2 Malay manager make a good lead to the team to make sure we dine in good experience. Food waiting time is slightly delay but they are trying their best of communication. Good job team somerset üôåüíô
You should try their pastas!,Was assisted by Hairi who was very polite and made sure we were served well. We ordered their aglio olio pasta which tasted good and we got our order pretty quickly. This is a good place to catch up with friends as the location is quite central too. Will come back next time for their desserts.
Good Service,Good Service by staff and well control by malay manager to ensure we dine in with good dine in experience. We disappointed with the waiting food delay roughly 30min actually but manager manage well to communicate with the chef to make our food serve hurry. Good Job. will return back when not busy day.
Thursday dinner,"The location is perfect for a date I think, I like to sit and see people passing by. It was Thursday night so it wasn‚Äôt crowded at 313, we were seated at the outskirts but it didn‚Äôt feel cramped. Food was delish and I had a great time chatting with my friend. Service was good too."
Cozy place to hang out üòç,Thanks to staff Elaine and the manager for the great service and very accommodating. Will definitely come back and hang out here more often. ü§© üëçüëèüèº
Brunch with plastic and flying birds,"Expected a relaxing brunch at the outlet but ended up with a less than satisfactory experience!! I was having my eggs Benedict dish when I saw I plastic corner from a packaging lying on my smoked salmon ! It was not a tiny piece and was quite hard . I was lucky to notice ur before I ingest it !

To make my experience worse , there‚Äôs a few pigeons flying around the restaurant totally ignoring the humans having their meal. The manager and staff seems quite at ease having them disturbing the customers and made no attempt to chase them out of the restaurant!! That‚Äôs so unhygienic!!"
"Good lighting, great food, excellent people.","Elaine and Hafiz at this Priv√© outlet made us feel super-welcome.

I was starving when we picked the restaurant from among many in the bustling Orchard-Somerset stretch of eateries in the heart of Singapore. My wife Rachel only wanted a small bite, though.

We both were able to order appropriately sized meals from a well-designed physical menu instead of one of those irritating online ones that often confuse my ageing brain. The food was excellent. The cafe latte was superb.

All told, it‚Äôs been a fine night out. We plan to return."
Coffee Prive Somerset,"Fantastic coffee Hafiz. Great Sunday start! Best coffee I have had in SG. Also, just being able to order 2 eggs on toast, off menu."
Great service,The service is excellent and the food is delicious. The ambience is great. It is a nice place to catch up with friends.
Did not meet expectation üò¨,"Had our lunch here on a weekday. Food is ok. I was expecting so much for the caesar salad but it‚Äôs a bit bland, I asked for extra sauce and the staff was kind enough to give me. Also, our food was not served at the same time, my Mom is just having a sandwich though.I think service can be better. The area is cool, it‚Äôs al fresco dining. I hope they can also offer happy hour on drinks during lunch hour, same to the rest of the restaurants along their side."
Food overpriced for the standard,Four pax bill turned up to be $200. Cocktails are diluted with syrups that could hardly taste the alcohol. We ordered cocktails not mocktails. Will not patronise as there are others better options.
Great Service and Dinner Venue with friends,"Excellent customer service from Hairi and Elaine Every single time we come, we are greeted by them with smile and courtesy. Totally enjoy each time we come.

We ordered our favourite samosa again with a new choice this time - satay.

The satay meat is fabulous, its so soft, tender and juicy. The satay peanut sauce taste is also unique, one of its own."
Review,"Perfectly nice location, perfect taste of food, Elly is very friendly and serving such good services. Highly recommended!"
Very good service,The service was good and the food was good. The place has a good vibe. Adly the server was soo nice.
Great,"Elaine was terrific, great food as well as the service, the location is great as always . I will visit again"
An Afternoon Break,"Long day of traveling and just needed to get out, get some sunshine and a small bite. This place was perfect for all three. Cool drinks, a great location for people watching and a short walk back to our apartment."
Disappointed,Don't bother with the mixed berry crumble... Served in a kids bowl.. cold... A bit of fruit and juice. Canola a nd ice cream... All for SGD 11 ... Don't bother...
Terrible!,"Service is terrible compared to other Prive outlets. Staff are not attentive and uninterested to serve. Waited for few mins before being served at the entrance when the place is pretty empty. Was showed to a table by Patrick which which was uncleared (a glass of drink). We asked if anyone is already seated there, he can still ask us what‚Äôs the problem until pointed out there was another drink on the table. He said it‚Äôs nothing and took it away. In the midst of taking our orders, he walked away. We asked for a baby chair and kids utensils too but never came so we had to asked another person for help. Generally food standards dropped or not as good as other branches. In the end, had to wait another 40mins to get my bill and existing membership (for $ redemption) sorted out cos they don‚Äôt know how to do it!"
Crew forgot my order,I'm so surprised that crew forgot my order. Im wait for 45minutes above after chat wif my frens then I'm realised that.
Disappointing compared to other Prive locations,"Staff came across rude and uninterested - might have just been a bad day! Burger didn‚Äôt come as advertised, missing lots of ingredients. A shame as we love Prive but this one didn‚Äôt live up to the others - would recommend going to Prives at Robertson Quay or Keppel Bay"
Appalling Service,4 adult family members- there were 2 orders - the first one was forgotten. We had breakfasts but the eggs were cold and the rest of the food lukewarm. The second order of one meal came out before the 2 nd order of 3 meals which were not delivered at the same time. The chefs both took a break at the same time and we couldn‚Äôt get served properly. There was clearly no management - when the cold eggs were sent back the chef and staff could be seen smirking about it. I will never come here again! In defence they credited 2 of the 4 meals.
Great service !,great service! staff called suhairi had excellent service and constantly apologised for our order getting messed up
Good service by Hairi,It was good service by Hairi and the restaurant looked nice. Too many birds outside. Will come back again.
Brunch this time,"I visited Prive Somerset after having dinner in their sister restaurant the night previous I was after trying their breakfast (although it was more lunchtime) I went for their take on the English breakfast and I must say it wasn't too bad at all, again cooked very well and left alone to eat the staff didn't keep bothering you... also an iced coffee went down well. Will go back"
Dinner meet up,"Price affordable,great food, drinks are superb and the ambience just nice for chillax and unwind with friends."
Cosy hole in Somerset,"The place is nicely ventilated and very comfortable even in sunny, humid Singapore. Coffee was decent, but the beer arrived flat and warm."
Drink stop on a busy shopping day,"Stopped for a drink during our visit to the shopping around this area.

We went to a number of Prive places in Singapore. Always found them comfortable and a nice relaxing break. A nice drink of wine or beer.

The samosas here were a little disappointing but the main game was a drink and sit down. Achieved that."
good atmosphere,Nice ambience so we chose to celebrate a birthday here. Staff were super friendly and even celebrated our friend‚Äôs birthday with us with free cake! Thank you for the awesome service üòÅ
great service,great service and ambience!! food is great too highly recommend the pasta and burgers :) will come again
Great place to hangout!!!,"Prive Somerset is really a cool place to hangout. Very convenient location.
Staffs are very nice too! Thanks to Mary and Jasmine. Great personality!
Very accommodating and they will make sure you are very well taken care of. Looking forward to visit again on our next trip.
Keep it up!"
Commendable ambience and staff!,"Went there for dinner and really enjoyed myself! Great ambience, and huge shoutout to Kelly & Mary who were so friendly! Despite being very busy, they were very attentive and patient to us throughout! üëçüèº Please send my compliment to them:‚Äù)"
THANK YOU MARY JANE! =),Had a wonderful night at Prive with friend. Thank you for the excellent service Mary Jane. The food was delicious.. will definitey be back again‚Ä¶
Prive Somerset - Congrats to the team esp Kelly!,"Kudos to the entire team of Prive Somerset branch. The good food is already a given. But the team's service is the x factor. Especially Kelly, who served every single table with quickness, friendliness and joy.

I don't usually leave reviews but because of Kelly's service, I just had to. Congratulations and I hope you get the recognition you deserve!"
Amazing and hardworking staff,"I visited Priv√© Somerset tonight at 8pm with my boyfriend. I am amazed by the hospitality and hardworking staff who served us. I would like to commend her for being so professional despite that we noticed they were under staff. She was able to manage guests including us from cleaning up the table to getting our orders to serving them. She is indeed hardworking and contributing significantly to overall dining experience.

I was not able to get her name but she was wearing glasses and with tied up hair. We‚Äôre thankful and grateful of her patience and kindness.

On the receipt, it said our orders closed by Staff: Mary JM but I was not certain because another colleague attended for bill payment. We left the restaurant happy and satisfied.

Bill No. #0080609"
Birthday dinner,"Food and ambience good as usual , was served by Jasmine, Jermaine and Mary with excellent and prompt service. Loved the brownie and impossible meat sliders!"
"Not worth visiting, food too woke","The food was lackluster and not worth the time and money spent. Their vegan-friendly carbonara is similar to an actual carbonara only by having carbo in its name. It was overly salty and sauce was unappetising.

Their steak and fries, was a disappointment where the beef was tough even on medium doneness (steaks can only be cooked medium to well done and no less, perhaps in an effort to ensure the cow is truly dead) and the fries were reminiscent of reheated leftovers."
REVIEW,"Very warm and welcoming staff! They gave us brownies for celebration of my friend‚Äôs birthday, and even a birthday card. Good food great vibes!"
Nice,Drink of the moment was great. Happy hour till 9pm. Staffs were friendly and attentive. Food was average but overall nice atmosphere and experience
Prive Somerset review,"Space at table was too tight to move in. No leg room at all. Food was so-so. Nothing to rave about. However, service staff were friendly."
Nice place,Good Food Great Service The happy hour is definitely worth it. Good selection of drinks and sides on the menu
great service and food,"Mary, Jasmine and Kelly were very friendly and helpful! The truffled mushroom swiss burger was delicious and I would definitely recommend! The coconut mojito was amazing too! It has a very milky and minty flavour. Would definitely come back for a chill afternoon next time!"
amazing food and drinks and even better service!,"Mary, Jasmine and Kelly were very friendly and awesome! The service was really prompt. We got our drinks and food within less than 15 minutes. The coconut and the blackberry & lychee mojito is TO DIE FOR! I had the truffle mushroom swiss burger and it was great. Definitely will come again. I had a very good dining experience here"
Great experience!,Jasmine was extremely friendly and helpful. She attended to all our needs and made us feel comfortable. Thank you for the great experience! Highly recommended!
Wonderful night of chill,Great environment and happy hour deals. Really enjoyed the ambience and the staff were very attentive and polite. Special thanks to Jasmine who kindly offered to change our table to a larger one! Was very touched by her kind gesture
Nice and relaxing but lack of SMM,"The ambience was good and cozy. In terms of food, it was nice and portion was very acceptable. However, the restaurant lack of safe distancing measures as Chefs and kitchen staffs was not wearing masks.

No vaccination or check in was done by any staffs throughout the service."
Lovely Lunch,"The ambience at Prive Somerset is cozy and relaxed. We were given a comfortable seat -umbrella and lights, much like alfresco but cool. The food is fabulous, especially the pizza and mudpie. Delicious indeed. Had a wonderful time indeed."
"Idyllic vibes, tasty bites, friendly service","If you're looking for a respite or to do some people-watching, or just missing European sidewalk cafes, this is a relaxed and cosy spot to be, over a glass of wine and deliciously satisfying pizza, right outside the side entrance of Somerset 313. Great food, great service, reasonable prices. Will be back one afternoon for coffee!"
Convenient but,"Dropped by for a quick business lunch. Welcome service was pedastrian. The chicken katsu nothing to write home about. And during lunchtime, they only have 1 staff to man all the tables. Looks like many other issues besides the CEO being hauled up to the court for physically assualting a child"
Best experience ever,"it is my second time at this particular outlet. it‚Äôs pretty amazing how much of a good time i have here. the staff remembered us and were very engaging, friendly and on the ball. this is probably gonna be my favourite place to wind down after a really hard day, knowing that i will be well taken care of. also, the pork belly aglio olio is to die for."
Bad dining experience ever,The wrap is hard & thick and hard to chew. Taste really bad & yucks. Won‚Äôt want to go there again or recommend to anyone
Friendly service,"Their food is very nice as well the staff over here is super friendly. When they know that we come over here celebrate with my friend they even surprise my friend with a birthday cake and hand written birthday card. Their service is excellent, will be coming back again"
Great place to meet friends and chill,It was a wonderful experience. Relaxing atmosphere and wonderful customer service. It was great that they had plenty of vegetarian options for my friend. Thank you for catering to our needs.
Feedback,The staff wasn't attentive as no topping up water and took awhile when I requested sauces for guest .
Good Lunch,Always enjoy my time at Prive as they offer good vegan options. Though I missed the vegan carrot cake at the 313 outlet.
Nice place to eat and chill.,Nice restaurant with great service staffs. Food is good as well. The chili crab spaghetti was interesting and good.
Love the food as its recommendation,Love the food as its recommendation by Brendan .Drinks was not good as food . Thansks to brendan . I will be back
Great Service and Ambience for GF Bday Surprise,"Had an amazing experience with Priv√©@Somerset. Made a reservation for gf bday and arranged a flower balloon delivery which the restaurant helped to receive. Went early to check on the reservation and was greeted by a staff named Brandon.

He took care of all the arrangements and honestly gave one of the best customer service experiences I've had as he set us up with the patio seating which gave a romantic vibe, checked in on us frequently and was just an overall friendly and enthu person."
Visit to Prive Somerset 11th March,Very good service and nice ambience in good location. Happy to have plenty of vegan options on the menu
Wide variety,"The pros: I like how they incorporate local dishes with other cuisines. This is also a great place to bring friends with food restrictions since there are gluten free and vegan options available. The food is pretty affordable, with meals under $25 available.

The cons:
1. They get very busy on weekends and holidays. I went on Valentine‚Äôs Day and booked a table for 2. The deposit cost me $42.80 despite being presented as $20 when I first decided to book it. It‚Äôs $20/pax without GST, which you may like to note if you‚Äôre going with a bigger group.
2. They seemed short on staff when I went. Calling the servers and trying to get their attention was quite hard because they were very busy. That being said, I understand that most staff don‚Äôt wish to work during the CNY/Valentine‚Äôs period so I doubt this is indicative of their usual performance."
Amazing service from Brandon,Amazing service from Brandon and delicious vegan food. We tried banana blossom fish and chips and the vegan hainanese chicken rice - fantastic !
Bella serve with exellence.,"Upon arrival, I was greeted with a very warm welcome by server Bella. Served us throughout our dinner and she was really friendly and always smiling through her mask. Thank you for the brilliant experience at priv√© bella. Highly recommended!"
Amazing service,"We were serve by Bel who is so enthu and the service was fast and quick, did not have a long waiting time. Food and drinks are amazing! Kudos to the team! Thanks bel for making it a fun eating experience!"
A nice vibrant meeting place with nice foods & drinks.,"A cozy & nice place with great ambience.

Staffs are very friendly and nice,
No regret to choose Prive as meet up, dinner together and birthday celebration.

Plus Prive offered ‚ÄúHappy Hours‚Äù .

Me and my colleagues are very happy, especially our birthday colleague.
Thanks to Safari & Brandon for their accommodation & great service, to make our night great."
Review,Great place to dine!! Food was served fast. Staff was friendly too:) I recommend trying the burgers as the beef is not only tender but it is enhanced with flavours as well.
ding ding,"food was great, definitely worth for the price. customer service was also commendable, would definitely come again"
excellent service,the staff were all very friendly and welcoming! i had a great dinner here and the ambience made the trip even more worthwhile.
Slow & Poor Service,"The food was average and the service was really slow and bad. Not only did it took long to get the attention of the waiter, the requests taken was then forgotten and we still have to get the attention of the waiter once again to remind him."
Something for everyone,"I love coming to prive cos i have a family of diverse eaters - and prive not only has Western and local food, but also vegan and meat options. Today i also took the opportunity to try their vegan chicken rice. While the ""chicken"" didnt taste like real chicken, it was a commendable attempt to recreate the dish with its sauces and all. The brown rice (option to switch to white) was on the dry side though. The impossible burger waa good as usual, and we also tried the vegan oreo cheesecake which was also a good vegan effort, but could be better if the coconut could be replaced with a more neutral smelling ingredient to be as close to the real deal as possible. Overall a nice visit that met our dietary needs and food preferences. Will keep coming, and i hope prive continues to upgrade and introduce new items to its menu!"
Great experience at Prive Somerset üíØüò¨,"A big thank you to chef Wei Lun and his team for the great hospitality. Good food, good vibes, and definitely would go again!"
Party,"Staffs are friendly, helpful and approachable.. good ambience.. food/drink is affordable and nice..."
Good ambiance,The staffs are friendly in offering all sort of celebration in the restaurant. The food and drink are good.
Happy hour drink,"The alcohol drinks are very affordable Caipiroska, gin tonic, vodka, beer, wine. It's a nice place to chill and friendly staff too."
Good ambiance at 313 priv√©,Had a great time with good food and 2 drinks during the happy hours on a weekend. Caipiroska and mango mojito were great.
Prive Review,Good food and great alcohol! I come here often with my friends for some chill drinking and good food :) a definite plus is the happy hour drinks and the cute waiter lmao.
lovely place w cheap ish drinks,i rlly enjoy the food here and it doesn‚Äôt hurt that the happy hour drinks are cheap ish !! it‚Äôs the go to place for my friends and i :))
Third time visiting prive Somerset,It‚Äôs my third time eating at prive somerset and the chefs have never disappoint me! One of the best pasta plated and taste absolutely delicious
Wonderful anniversary dinner experience,"The food presentation were great, so did the service. The restaurant knew that it was our wedding anniversary, so they prepared us a nice dessert with a candle on top. Moreover, the staff was so sweet that they took a instant photo for us and paste it on a card with wishes written by the restaurant staffs. I was so in touched! Definately a wonderful place for small family celebration. Thank you for all the great moments you broght to our family! Cheers!"
Healthy food and friendly attentively staff,"We were here last night with my friends to catch up and celebrate a belated birthday. Food tasted great except the salmon I had,the portion was slightly too small. Other than that, especially the dessert - dark chocolate brownie with a scoop of nice cream was lovely. The staff are friendly and offered us a surprise, took a Polaroid shot of our group and signed off with a card for our birthday gal. So sweet of them. We enjoyed our dinner and time spent there. Will come back again."
Steak,"We ordered 2 steak and half chicken. Half chicken was great, with sumptuous gravy. Ordered medium steak but came well done. Not really wonderful though."
Enjoyable evening here,"First time here for dinner with colleagues. Ordered truffle mushroom pizza, Mexican salad, satay, parmesan wings, pasta and happy hour drinks for sharing. Enjoyed the food and great service, staff are friendly and helpful even though the place and fully packed. Will come again."
Really enjoyed my time,"Great, friendly service! Enjoyed the crab cakes and my fish and chips, too. I liked the Belgian draft beer."
Service,"Service very terrible, staff ignoring customers, very rude, even gave wrong change for bill. Very bad experience."
Standard drop,Always ordered sticky date pudding everytime I visit prive. However this time round perhaps due to cost cutting measures the standard is different from before. The walnuts used to be whole now it‚Äôs 2-3 shaved Sliced Super flat small PCs of walnut. I don‚Äôt have pictures to show cos ya it‚Äôs really that little that I finished up before even having any left to take a picture
