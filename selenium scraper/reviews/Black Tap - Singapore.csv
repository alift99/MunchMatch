Great place to have a burger,"Great food and service. Staff was very welcoming and accommodated walk in during the busy week. Food was really good across appetisers, main and the milk shakes are a must try. Helpings are large so order accordingly."
"The most family-friendly place at MBS. Great burgers with many options for all to find suitable menu, great service","I recommend Black Tap to all families and groups of friends looking for good food with attentive, hospitable service.
The burgers are very very good. There are many options so that everyone can find sth exciting in the menu, from burger fanatics to meat lovers, cheese lovers and vegan friends. There are also salad options. We tried the Asian corn as well
It is easy to make it a meal with various side options. Portions are very generous. Craft beers, cocktails, mocktails, non alcoholic drinks to go along.
We did not try the milkshakes.

Burgers that we tried and recommend: The Greg Norman (Award Winning burger with wagyu beef, blue cheese, dill), The Carolina burger (with prime burger, pulled pork and coleslaw), The Old Fashioned (with prime burger, caramelized onions, shiitake mushrooms, horseradish sauce). All were super super good.

The experience is also good thanks to the quality of service: attentive, warm, hospitable, reactive. The restaurant layout is good and provides ample space for each group of diners. The music is good."
My Happiest Birthday Celebration with yr staff in Black Tap!,"I would like to thank Jasmine, Roan, Ms Khan, Paul, Max & Mac Coy for their friendliness & awesome service! It's the Happiest Birthday Experience for me today! Pls convey my appreciation to them, pls! Thank you so much! Molly Tan 81287526"
Special treat combining craft beers and milkshakes (!),"Black Tap is a craft beer, cocktail, mocktail and milkshake venue within the Shoppes, an upmarket shopping centre attached to the Casino and Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
It has an interesting range of global craft beers, with two from Singapore. It also sells oversized milkshakes that will wow children, and meals.
Even when there’s no queue and spare tables they require a mobile phone number and text you a notification for when a table is free.
Prices are quite high eg $22 for a milkshake and $18 for on tap beers.
However the quality of the drinks is excellent.
Recommended as a special treat."
Wonderful evening,The Wagyu burger was delicious. Goes well with the sides and wine. Love the ambience. Manage to catch the light show after dinner. Overall a very good evening out.
Black Tap a nice place to dine,"Great time, lovely and friendly people not to mention Ms Jasmine Choi and Roan. Food is great, need to come back and try the other as I get full stomach on my serving as it was for me, quite a big serving."
Not just burgers,"Run very well with enthusiastic staff.

Family not arrived so not given table. That’s fine. Don’t chope the place. When they arrived, automatically shown to our table.

Lamb burger salad with feta and olives. Loved it. Excellent food. I’d recommend you take it at easy hours. Friday nights or Saturday nights? Start queuing at 4.

Good luck."
Delicious burgers and milkshake,"Burgers: Greg Norman and Wagyu Steakhouse burger were delicious. The beef patty well seasoned and went well with blue cheese (in Greg Norman burger). The fries came with each burger and in large portion.

Tried the Nutella shake - creamy, rich Nutella taste. Nice.

Alcoholic drink ‘Wednesday we wear pink’ was a letdown. Tasted more like syrup."
Best burger in town,"Great burgers, amazing dessert milkshakes, and fantastic craft cocktails. Nice location inside the MBS Shoppes"
The best shakes and burgers - probably in the world!,"Absolutely the best milk shakes in the world and probably the best burgers too! Seriously good. Thank you Ivan Lim. Great service too. Eat here, you won’t regret it. 100% recommended. We loved it and hope it opens in London soon!"
Black Tap,"Excellent service will sure to come back again. Burgers, wings, sweet potato, fried mozzarella and shakes are so yummy. Thank you"
Great Burgers!,"Great place to have burgers and drinks that looked drool worthy. We went as a family and after shopping were so hungry, luckily there was no long queue so we wanted to give it a try. Ordered burgers and some sides. Their sauces/ dips are really great to go with wings and burgers. I really liked their freshly made guac. The portions are big though bit pricey but worth it. They dont serve warm drinks, wish they would. Other than that, def a place to go and have good food in an equally good ambience!"
Great Service,Attentive and Friendly staff. Came promptly to take orders and provided extra cutlery in anticipation of sharing. Very nice.
Awesome food and ambience,"From queing to booking for a family of 11 pax, right up to the servers, the staff was awesome..... we were celebrating 2 of our family members birthdays and the staff (which I did not get his name, he always had a smile and was very attentive) surprised us with 2 whipped cream cake with candles. It truly made these 2 boys sooooo happy...... food was awesome as always.... I came with my family of 4 during Christmas Day and today I brought my sister's family of 5 and together with our family of 6, we had a total of 11 pax...... thank you to Black Tap staff for making today and Christmas Day such a memorable and happy occasion..... as always, have a wonderful Happy New Year 2023"
Always Enjoy Outing with Family In Black Tap MBS,"Never fail to impress, Great Food, Services and my favourite Brooklyn Beers. My family first choice gatherings for end year of 2022 Dinner."
Kids love the shakes,"Had the classic and traditional burgers, really good. The crazy shake was awesome! It’s always a long queue, so better to make reservation."
"We’ve been there twice in a week. So, that speaks how good it is there. The staff are friendly and lovely.",The variety of food was there and the burgers are a must. The salad was great and the portions are perfect. The drinks deserve another paragraph to describe it. It’s amazing! The Crazy shakes are a must try! For both adults and children. They’re amazing.
NA,"The meal is above average, the staff friendliness and the service are way above my expectation. Cozy ambience, great experience definite a place to recommend friends, family and tourists without embarrassing. Overawe a well-organized management team to make it happen, we are very thankful! keep it up, cheers hip-hip hooray. Here's to a happy and healthy new year 2023 to all of you. Thank you."
Best place for shakes and snacks,"We went over the Christmas weekend. Despite the long weekend, we were seated at our tables in less than 15 mins slightly before dinner time. The staff were friendly, warm, attentive and most importantly they made the children feel welcomed. While ordering food for the family, the staff was considerate to share the spiciness of certain food, he was kind enough to warn us given we had children in the group. We will definitely be back again as they family enjoyed it thoroughly."
"Great burgers, skip the shakes","Waited in line for her and 20 mins which was great given how long the queue was. Burgers were on point with the combination of flavours working very well with each other. The price for burgers average at about S$25. Had a huge side of freshly fried fries as well.

The crazy shake though... it was like drinking liquid candy. I ordered the churro shake which my husband and I split. We didn't get past 1/3. That cost us S$24. I'd say skip the shake and indulge in their burgers."
Good food but overpriced,"They serve delicious burgers together with very filling milkshakes (emphasis on the VERY, they're filled to the brim and even come with whole slices of cake - so do not order if you won't finish!) Food portions are also huge so do take note of that. Despite that, the prices are slightly pricier, but that is to be expected given the location and portion sizes."
Black Tap,Did a reservation at Black Tap to celebrate Wife's Birthday. The customer service was excellent. Their food and beverages were excellent and serving portion was good. Will be definitely going back again.
Good comfort food and friendly staff’s,"Highly recommended, staff are super friendly, great portion of food and delicious 🤤. Reasonable prices and the waiting time of food is also fast ."
Good experience,This is my 2nd time visiting Black Tap and I’m satisfied with the food and service. The staff was really friendly and ensure that me and my Mom get the best experience possible. I would definitely recommend to my friends!
Happy Dinner,We had a great time here the service was fantastic.all our food was delicious we got Holiday Juice Lucy crispy chicken sandwich korean bbq wings idaho fries with korean bbq sauce with cookies n cream supreme crazy shake overl all its was great experience and i would highly recommend
Good to give it a try,"Reasonable pricing with a wide variety of choices to choose from. Serving is big for Asians (my view). A wide range of cocktails and mocktails. Friendly staff. If you do not want to join in the queue, can make a reservation."
Great food. Some things a bit overpriced,Popular restaurant throughout the year. Good service. Good food. Better to make a booking in advance. Crazyshakes definitely worth a try - something unique - but watch out for the sugar rush and calorie count.
Burger night,Interesting choice of burgers. Liked the sides included. Shakes a little too much but that’s their signature drink. Craft beer interesting selection
Businesswoman,"Love the food, services and the ambience only if the restaurant has a designated section for family with young children as the kids were too vocal and active. We just wouldn't enjoy and relax to dine-in and might not looking fwd to come back again even though the food n services were great This should be part of the services and the mgmt should look into it."
Love the huge and yummy food,Love black tap food and would recommend frens and family to go there! Food portion is huge so if order 1 set meal pls share with frens!
Excellent as usual!,"Great food, service and atmosphere, as usual! We always have an extremely good experience at Black Tap."
Best experience ever !!,"Would like to callout the service provided from the beginning itself.. whilst in the queue (after a long wait) we were registered and asked for any food allergies, etc. Seeing that we were in a bit of a rush, they quickly setup our table.

We were then guided on food selection and options that suited us, very candid and friendly staff.

We loved the milkshake (churros) and the chicken and vegan sandwich. The portion was also right sized.

Now comes the best part where I feel the staff had gone above and beyond by leaps to help us.

My daughter realised on the way out that she was missing the ring on her index finger.
While tracing back the events she concluded that the ring would have come off when she was wiping her finger with the tissue paper.

When we told the staff about this event they listen to us patiently and assisted to find the ring around the table we sat at and one of the waiting staff also went ahead the check the trash that he could recollect binning the tissue paper from our table.

We looked back at our pics to be double sure, and yes indeed the ring was on her finger while eating.

This made it certain that the ring would be in the trash.

As this ring was an heirloom gifted to my daughter from her mum, belonging to her great grandmother it has special sentimental value and was super precious to us.

We then insisted the ring had to be in the trash, and there is no way we could accept that it cant be found.

Sighting our desperation and the value of this ring , the restaraunt manager offered us to sieve through the trash ourselves.

He took out the trash bag from the bin and gave us gloves to go through the trash ourselves

Please do note that this was peak hours on a Saturday night, so they were very kind to accommodate our request and give us the attention whilst they had customers queuing up.

My daughter was very optimistic and full with energy and started to dig in this white trash bag.
What seemed to be a simple task was actually a Herculean effort.
Going through every piece of the trash - food remains - burger, fries, half eaten , mushy ..
there was also the straws, tissues, wet wipes , wooden skewers, etc etc .. list goes on …

My daughter spent almost 90 mins to go through the first trash bag. I had jumped in the middle to help her, but had gone away to report this to security / police (all of who were not empathetic at all )
By the time i returned back after making the complaint on the phone for police assistance my daughter almost finished the first bag and was exhausted and loosing hope.

Another staff had in the meanwhile kept aside 2 more trash bags which could potentially have the tissues from our table.

We started again sieving the last bits of this trash bag .. seeing my daughter exhausted and giving up another restaraunt employee (@Reynaldo) came up and started assisting in this search effort .. we completed the first bag and moved on the the second bag.

We started looking through the trash for about 15 minutes .. and then eureka , we found the tissue paper containing the ring.. Reynaldo passed me the ring and I gave it to my daughter.

We were thrilled and ecstatic to finally find this precious piece of legacy and our family tradition back in our possession.

What a big relief !! Phew.

Want to thank the entire crew at Black Tap, and special callout for @Bryce and @Reynaldo for their individual efforts.

This is a chapter we will remember all our lives.

Highly recommend this restaurant not just for the great food but also the best serving staff and probably the best experience ever !!"
Great place for family casual dining,Good food and service. Nothing fancy just plain fun and yummy burgers. Thanks to Jasmine for your great service.
Dinner outing,"Good selection of burgers,great taste, nice portion. Top off with milkshake if feeling indulgent. Else a bottle of wine if slow evening."
"Great food, if a little bit expensive","Great choice of food and the burgers are special. If you can stomach the calories try one of their amazing shakes. I had the Sweet and Salty, peanut butter and it was a great big WOW

Staff were attentive and friendly but didn't always listen well enough"
Excellent customer experience with restaurant manager,Excellent food and customer experience Food service was delayed. But the way the restaurant manager dealt with it was five star. He came to our table three times to make sure that we were good. Good was good as usual.
Black Tap,The food and drinks are all worth your money and the atmosphere is very warm & cozy. Great place to hang out with friends and family.
Euphoric Menu Designs and Milkshakes,"The Black Tap is probably more popular because of their Crazy Shakes..which are edible artwork! Menu is extensive and full of unusual items and combinations along with the usual fare. I didn't get to try their milkshakes as I found it too big for my liking.
The outside view is amazing and great for people watching. Alas the chicken wings was rather disappointing and bland. Definitely not the cheapest burger in town but tasty."
lovely service at black tap,great!! the service staff at the entrance was really attentive and provided us fast service plus she was very polite. The food and drinks arrived quickly and freshly cooked.
You must eat here at least once,Must eat here especially with kids the sight of the crazy shakes alone will blow their hair back! Quality generous food portions. Looks like a “typical”food franchise however performs like a well oiled hospitality machine. Friendly & switched on attentive staff make this beer & burger restaurant outstanding. It was thoughtful and very progressive our waiter John asked us about allergies before placing our order to the kitchen. As a seasoned international traveller I’m a hard food critic to please. You need only make eye contact and service is at your table excellent hospitality just what Sg is known for. Hard to find better service post pandemic. Book online to avoid disappointment. These guys are a credit to the hospitality industry well done Black Tap. Big bonus points to John from the minority guest who does have a food allergy. Thankyou!
Good to try other drinks and burgers,Portion was big and we ended up over ordering. Service was fast too as we had a show to catch. Will come back to try other items in the menu
Perfect,Very very good restaurent I really recommend it excellent service The food was amazing and the crazy shake were very impressive In total its a little expensive but you eat so much that its not a big problem
Black Tap MBS | Lunch,"Overall nice dining experience with nice food. Well loved by my family 😍 Especially the crazy shake, the kids love it!"
"Great service, Crazy shakes and tangy wings","Great service generous portions of food and creative menu. We were very entertained by the friendly staff and appreciated that he was very accommodating to our special requests and attentive to our needs. The food was tasty and the portions were generous. The falafel burger was crispy and yummy and the salad was tasty, crunchy and refreshing. The Wagyu burger was a tad overdone & dry but the accompanying salad more than compensated for it. The crazy shake was crazy sweet and had to be shared by 3. The wings were tangy and spicy and the Guac & chips paired very well with an interestingly created salsa verde."
Birthday lunch,"Excellent staff - Jon in particular. Great food and good prices. Came for casual birthday lunch as staff always outstanding and food always excellent. If you want consistently good service and food, Black Tap is highly recommended."

Wonderful Dinning Experience,"The staffs were friendly, the service was quick and the food quality was delicious. Define will bring my family for dining again!"
Lunch,"Not a bad experience. Nice food. Food portion is big, good if you can shared it with your partner. No complimentary birthday cake if you are celebration your birthday. U would need to purchase an shake where they will put a candle on it."
Lunch at Blacktap,Friendly waiters and waitresses were very attentive to our needs and the food was tasty especially the wagyu beef burger.
Avoid due to unfriendly attitude by staff!!,"What a most unwelcoming experience. The staff did not want us there from the start. Introduced the bill aggressively , plonked it on the table rudely. Tried to order a drink and was told with glee that the bar was shut .
Then they shone a search light on us and if to say F off.
Never again and would never recommend this unfriendly Kip to anyone.Food was ok but ruined by attitude."
Nice ambient restaurant for a drink!,Variety of alcohol and non alcohol drinks and food (mostly beef) to choose. Food portion is big and need to be shared if you are small eater.
Birthday celebration,"The food were delicious. However, the crazy milkshakes were to sweet until my kids surrendered after 2 to 3 sips. Hope to see semi sweet milkshakes in the menu soon."
Excellent!,"Great food, especially the burgers and shakes! Excellent atmosphere and service too. Highly recommended."
Sunday Trip out,Ive been to black tap a couple of times with my colleagues as i worked around the area. Today was a first for my 7 yr old boy. Mind you he is a picky eater. I asked him how's the food? His reply was clear - mommy its a 10/10. I wanna come again. There you have it. Good for friends catchup. Good for family also with kids. Weekends no reservation. Just come early so you wont be disappointed.
Great place for business meeting though they have a cap of 1.5hours for dinning,Great food for American dinning. They had lamb burger. Was wanting if they can offer bison burger also. Portion was sufficient though I wish they could offer options for healthier choices then fries
Excellent service,Staffs were very accommodating and friendly. They even check up on us time to time. The filipino staffs were very attentive to us and very patient with our q’s about the menu. Highly recommended
TGIF,"Overall satisfied with all the food quality and with a reasonable price , will definitely visit again."

"Great Burgers, Beers & Shakes!!!","You will be immediately greeted at the door. The restaurant was full so we dis have the counter seats which was fine. Food were amazing! You should try the Fried Mozzarella and Chicken Wings. For Burgers, Wagyu Steakhouse and Carolina are the best. Have your sides changed to Sweet Potato Fries or Onion Rings for additional $3 only. Don’t ever miss the CrazyShakes. It’s massive but it’s worth trying. It’s part of the experience. Kudos to the Chefs and the service who made sure we are enjoying our food. Thank you Black Tap. Until next time. I love you guys!!!"

Amazing lunch,"We wanted to have a nice and casual lunch and it turned out to be an amazing feast. The food was just so good, we tried lots of stuff and every dish was great. The food portions are very generous so make sure not to order too much. And if you plan to have one of their famous shakes - those are a meal in themselves.
All the food we tried was delicious, the shakes are amazing, and we also tried the beer and cocktails, all was superb.
Black Tap is the perfect place to socialize and have a good time...and a feast"

One of the best burgers I’ve ever had.,"So this was one of the best burgers I’ve ever ha d I’m not just saying that, but this burger was genuinely one of the most perfectly cooked and tastiest burgers ever. They unfortunately didn’t have sweet potato fries anymore (sad face) but the normal fries and everything about the dish was delicious.

I was a walk-in customer with no reservation. Within about 10 minutes I had a table and was enjoy one of their excellent craft beers. Glancing across the other table looking at one of their cake milkshakes got a bit of a laugh after seeing how big the thing was; but the whole experience was great. Thank you!

This place is highly recommended."
Great dinner choice,Great burger but even greater and elaborate peanut butter milk shake. Enjoyed every bit and friendly waiter :D
Chill dinner with burger and beers,Great ambience with laid back vibes. Good service. Got the Carolina burger and baja chicken burger. Burgers were made fresh and serviced piping hot. Juicy and delicious. Milkshake was amazing. Beer was smooth with less alcohol content. Beer are on the pricier side. Overall good visit.
Family visit,"Great food, good size for an early dinner. Very impress with the knowledge of gluten intolerance and 2 of us had a gluten free bun! Burger patties done to each our tastes which is great. Thank you to the lovely knowledgeable staff members."
Wagyu burger,I ordered a wagyu burger. You can choose the doneness. I got medium. Patties that are not oily and have a delicious flavor are the best. Comes with plenty of fries. Best eaten with craft beer. You will feel full and happy.
