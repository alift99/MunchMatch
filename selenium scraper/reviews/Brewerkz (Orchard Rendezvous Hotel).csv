5 Star Service,"The ambience is nice. Classy renovated restaurant. 5 Star service! However, the food is just average, lower than my expectations. Hope the food will be better the next time I visit."
Yeehaa,"Wonderful, friendly service with a smile.. En Qi was our bar tender.. I believe she is manager material ðŸ˜€ðŸ¤Ÿ"
Great place to chill after work,"Besides the beer that is always great, I noticed that this branch serves food that is not very salty. some pub will serve food salty so that more beers can be sold. I ordered most of the starters. highly recommend for anyone to try TRIPLE GARLIC PORK RIBEYE. very yummy"
Sunday Drinks by the Bay,"More of a tourist stop, but the beer was excellent and the food ok for a place like this. Service a little slow, and it closed early Sunday, maybe COVID to blame again. Price of food and drinks very good also."
bad service,"sorry to say but the service is now very poor. Young, inexperienced staff with insufficient training"
Scary incompetent staff,"My wife and I went in for a meal. The waiter came to take the order of drinks, and two meals. After a long while the drinks, and the food for my wife turned up. After 15 minutes of waiting the waiter came and presented the menu. That happened 3 times, one time done by the same waiter who took our order. After an hour and my food didn't turn up, we paid and left.
A guy couldn't get I contact with the staff to pay for his meal, so he left!!
It's such a shame to experience that form of incompetence amongst 3 staff.
Singapore has so many fine restaurants, choose one of them instead!!!"
Ignorant staff,"Ignorant staff and service! Food was somehow okay but when staff never see you, they are standing at their desk looking out over the crowd not seeing you it gets really terrible. I even told the servant and he was kind of not taking me seriously. Never again! Find another place!!"
Bad Restaurant,"A disorderly restaurant, main course came out before the starter, the main had an egg on top that was undercooked. Worst food experience Iâ€™ve had in Singapore."
Good but expensive real ale place at the top of Orchard Road,"Great open air bar at the top of Orchard Rd. Staff very attentive and friendly. Microbrewery Beer is good but quite expensive.. If you are tired of lager, this is the place to go"
Good to go,"Went here for a quick dinner. I had the spare ribs which were very good. The drinks menu is extensive. Staff are fine and pay attention. This is very close to the Orchard Rendezvous and a good option if you are staying there.

Outdoor seating is great."
A good go to,Food was good as always but they were out of a number of beers which was disappointing. Always a solid go to when indecisive.
Nice choice of beers with a chillout atmosphere,There's a good choice of beer in the menu to try. The place was spacious and our seats were outside. The restaurant is located in area that is not so busy with foot traffic (because of the pandemic) so we liked the relaxed atmosphere. The restaurant has undergone a renovation so everything looked new.
Great service and excellent food,"We come here every few weeks while waiting for my daughter to finish her drum class at Forum. Top picks for us are the fried sardines, angelhair pasta, sausage platter and the burgers. Plus itâ€™s not very crowded, so itâ€™s a lovely place to chill while waiting.
Definitely worth checking out if youâ€™re in the area."
Great place for people watching,This location is at the start of Orchard Road and is a great place for an afternoon pint and people watching. Food is decent.
"Great service, vegetarian-friendly","The offerings of craft beers on tap in this outlet is smaller than the one at Riverside. That said, we ended up going with a bottle of wine at the recommendation of the friendly young waitress.
The food was good - my dining partner recently decided to cut meat so we ordered a vego nachos and the Impossible Burger. Definitely some vegetarian options on offer.
Outdoor seating was delightful on a cool evening. I was also very appreciative of the friendly waiters who moved our table from the stools to the regular seats because I don't trust my sense of balance to not fall off after a glass of vino.
Overall wonderful dining experience, highly recommend, will like to go back to try the beers!"
Great Service,"There is a great array of beers. Service was great. Will definitely come back here. Thank you Vilynn , Rayvin and Ryan for making my visit so special, looking forward to receiving your service again. Will definitely recommend to all my friends."
Good Kids Meal,"Very filling portions, good pizza, delicious fries and good value. Came with ice cream. I had the Caesar salad with trout, which you donâ€™t find very often in Singapore."
Utilize Happy Hour,There is a mix of beers to sample...American Pale ale is the best...but also most expensive. Make the most of happy hour as you currently you get 15% of..
great double IPA if you like beer with a punch,Really enjoyed the Double IPA - just the right amount of bitterness. Wouldn't drink too many though....
Appreciate good service,"Room service Guan zhen friendly and helpful. Thks you ðŸ˜˜.Help me clean up the room, vaccum the room."
Appreciate good service,"room service ms xiao chen friendly and helpful, when I carry heavy things, appreciate she quickly come and help me, hold the things, and open the door for me."
5 Star Beers,Love the beer selection here. Will definitely come back for another round when the situation gets better!
Great place to have craft beers in the Orchard area,"This is a great place to have craft beers in the Orchard area. At first I thought it was a bit expensive, but then I learned that beers are expensive in Singapore (even for a Norwegian)."
Nice ambience and food,"This restaurant is located at Orchard Rendezvous Hotel, at one end of Orchard Road. There's an outdoor area, and it's quite nice looking at people walking along the streets while you eat. Good selection of beer and my friends loved the baby ribs. My Impossible burger was good too."
Good Caesar Salad,"I had an enjoyable meal with a long-time friend, who stuck me with the bill. Good selection of draft beer. Enjoyed sitting outside on a nice evening. Easy-to-find location on Orchard Road, right next to the Hilton."
"Good beer, nice food","Good beer, nice food, and good service. One of our must visit places when visiting Singapore after arriving as they open late. Recommend for couples and families."
Half Rack Baby Back Ribs,"The restaurant is just by the Orchard Rendezvous Hotel at the end of Orchard Road and the beginning of Tanglin Road. There is plenty of casual outdoor seating and one can order at the table. Service was very friendly, repeating the orders even twice.

Brewerkz is apparently a microbrewery - founded in 1997 - with several branches in Singapore. They have different types of their own beer available, served draft in the sizes 'stem' (330ml), 'pint (500ml) and 'jug' (1.4l). I went for a 'Golden Ale', which was quite good, but not my favourite kind of beer. With the meal I then had wine from Chile.

My choice was a 'Half Rack Baby Back Ribs', which were slow cooked and finished on the grill, glazed with BBQ Sauce and served with Coleslaw and as a side either French Fries, Cheddar Cheese Potato Mash or Salad. It was very good.

Excellent was also their dessert: 'Variations of Apple' (Sour Apple Granite, Apple Cinnamon Ice Cream, Speculoos Crumble, Caramelized Apples). With all this high quality food it is natural that there is also a price for it."
Tried the Impossible Burger,"We were immediately seated for the very reasonably priced lunch special. Ordered the Impossible Burger with mashed potatoes and both were very good. The only draw back was the burger was a little overcooked but for a plant-based burger, it was still good. Lunch and service will keep us coming back."
First time in Singapore,"Just had King Brew burger and sampled a few beers. It's all great , cannot fault anything. Definitely recommend and we will be back for sure. Thanks !"
Craft beers of high class,"The beer range at Brewerkz is very high class, and should be able to satisfy almost any taste - for beer lovers....... The food meny very traditional for accompanying beers"
Great place for a Friday-night hangout!,Had the DIPA and my fiance had the Oktoberfest beer. Great choices! Would definitely come back again.
"Very good food, beers and service","Every time I visit in Singapore I visit in Brewerkz (Orchard) for a a good pizza or a good rib-eye steak. The food is very good, there is a good variety of beers and the service is excellent."
Best burgers,"Love the burgers here â€“ meatiness is on point, patty not overcooked and goes perfectly with the Oktoberfest pint over lunch."
"Good ambience, service and food","First visit to this resturant for a evening birthday celebration. Service was prompt, food served was good, and of large portions, and we'll recommend sharing instead of 1 each for each individual. Ambience was chill and relaxing too"
Best IPAs,"Brewerkz's IPA is by far the best in Singapore. It is strong enough, 5.8% without being overwhelming and leaves a lingering bitter after taste which I much prefer over the sweetness of most fizzy pop lagers."
Awesome drinks and amazing service,Had dinner here last night .Extraordinary location and impeccable service .The staffs were so friendly and very efficient . Will be back definitely:)
best brunch at Brewerkz orchard,have a brunch a couple day back on the orchard road branch.. great food selection and there's kids menu too which is great for me I just need afresh brew of my golden ale :) definitely will be back
Amazing food and service,"We visited Brewerkz in Orchard on a Monday evening. The food choices were limited but it was good, especially the beeramisu !!! However, the cheese sticks were not what I had expected it to me. It was not worth the price. However,the service was great - The staff were attentive and had a smile on them everytime(: Thank you for the service and recommendations on the food!"
Worth a visit,"Great beer, good service and food. A worthy stop for the thirsty in Singapore. Iâ€™ve lived here in Singapore for 3 years and it consistently has solid craft beer. Being from Oregon (the land of IPAâ€™s) I consider myself a pretty good judge :-)"
"Love this brewery! Great service, fantastic service, and delicious IPAs","Brewerkz has a fantastic happy hour with 1/2 price brews. I got the IPA and my partner got the West Coast IPA. Both were tasty, smooth, crisp, and so refreshing in this balmy Singaporean climate. Highly recommend Brewerkz for happy hour, appetisers, and full meals. Great service, fantastic service, and delicious IPAs."
Great food and service!,"A group of friends and I went to eat at this place! ordered a cowboy burger, Sausage and Mash etc, Food was awesome, drank wits bier. Service from Shane and Yee Teng was fantastic, engage with us with small conversation and shared and recommended fantastic food that we loved!"
Awesome food and great service,"The new Beeramisu is a must try so are the truffle fries and their burgers.
We had the cowboy burger which was awesome and juicy.
The staff are attentive and the friendly manager Shane gave great recommendations.
A thumbs up and must try for burger lovers in town."
Great place for a beer and a bite to eat!,"I frequently travel to Singapore, and whenever I do, I make it a point to always stop at Brewerkz. The Tanglin Road location is a great stop for a beer and a bite to eat, whether you're taking an Orchard Road shopping break, lunch or dinner after a movie, or just hanging out. Always a great selection of signature and seasonal craft beers, and the best burger around! Be sure to say hello and get a nice smile from Vilynn the manager!"
Good place,"Walking past, thought I would stop in for a beer. There beer is quite good. Service was good. Satay skewers were pretty good"
"Excellent service, Superb food and drinks.","I've been here with my friends, family or even a date with my hubby. It can be a place for any gathering. Excellent service from the start. My girls loves the chicken fingers from the kids menu, highly recommended! They wont forget their ice cream too after their meal. For me and hubby, we loves their unique chili fries, also recommended for those who wants bites while drinking. Superb beers and margaritas too. Kudos to all the staffs and their manager who trained them well! I will definitely be back again."
Food drinks service fantastic,"Nice chili fries and meat lover pizza plus the service was excellent all complete. Nice to hang out for any occasions, Will definitely come back!"
For beer,Excellent - The music food and beer was excellent. But the service was outstanding. The management staff was professional on an international level. Cheers Brewerks (miss you guys Ed Sâ€™)
Beer and snack,Dropped in for a beer and decided to have snack.. so glad I did... plenty of craft beers to choose from and the snack was great will be back
Amazing food and people!!,"Love this place. Lovely staff , especially Shane!! and amazing food.thought not a beer fan, love the whiskeys!! Thank you and must visit place. Near the heart of city Orchard road. Cheers, Raju."
Forerunner of craft beer scene in Singapore.,"Brewerkz is the forerunner of craft beer culture in Singapore; even before craft beer was a word here. All my friends know Brewerkz is my go-to place after a long week at work. A Cowboy burger with fries as a side, paired with couple pints of hoppy pale ales is always a great way to kick start my weekend.

I have chosen to tag the Orchard brunch which is the most access for tourist; but you would most certainly want to check out the flag ship restaurant at RiverWalk which is quite a institution."
Best Beer and buffalo wings,"Friendly staff, great food, cozy ambiance. Great for friends get together and casual date! Super love the El Diablo buffalo wings!!!"
Best service,Great service. I was at the bar alone and lady manager Vilynn was very helpful when i ask about their beer's the wings was good that i have to oder a second plate. Overall the beer was great and service was superb. Will deffinately be a regular :)
Lack of energy at this place- expected more,Chicken Satay was ok.. baked potato had zero flavor and it didn't feel much like a bar- zero energy at this place
"Best beer, best food and best service","My friends and I had 2 jars of beers, staff was so thoughtful our beer gets warm he brought an ice bucket for us without asking!
The burger was seemly heavenly! The best burger in town!
Was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful their double IPA was! High quality beer. Will definitely return with more friends."
Great wings,Awesome wings and great service. Happy hour prices are very good. Looking forward to coming back. Great selection of beers.
American style diner attached to hotel,"There are many American style diners in Singapore and this one appeared to be one of the better ones. The chicken satay starter was very good and my pulled pork sandwich was tasty as well. The wifeâ€™s burger bun was a little disappointing, but she said the rest of it was good. Onion rings were also good.

Service was efficient and the place was obviously popular. Good selection of beers as well."
Great Burgers and beers,"had dinner with freinds visiting and a catch up wiht old freinds. the food was as usual great and they could modify the menu to meet the dietary restrictions of my guests, Gluten-Free option.
Beers needed to be a bit colder but after the feedback to the wait staff, all subsequent beers were perfectly chilled. perhaps they were changing a line when the first beers were pulled."
A good burger in the heart of the city,"Although they are pricey, I like the burgers at Brewerkz. The portion size is generous and the fries are great. I like the location of the Orchard Road branch for its convenience and outdoor seating. Thereâ€™s indoor seating too, but itâ€™s not nearly as atmospheric. The beer is brewed locally and there are some interesting varieties. Brewerkz has been in business for over 20 years and itâ€™s still a favourite of mine. There are other items on the menu, besides burgers; I can recommend the salads, chicken wings, and pizza."
Great place for craft beer & burgers!,"Big selection (7) of craft beer and burgers. Choice of sides like mashed potato, fries or salads. Nod a big selection of wine, esp wine by the glass. Taste of the food and beer is great, although service is quite slow for a Sunday night."
"Food cold, way too salty and past its use-by date",Staff were very supportive of my food requirements but I was so disappointed when the fish and salad turned up. The salad had wilted bits and tasted old and awful. The fish wasnâ€™t hot and was way too salty - inedible. They didnâ€™t charge me so I was grateful for that.
Great lunch deal,"I usually go to the brewerkz at riverside point. Today I stopped by the orchard road location for a quick lunch and it has a more limited menu compared to the main branch but they have the same lunch special. At sgd 16.50 for a salad (go with the Caesar), main (I had the pizza but the burger is also good) and a pint of in house brewed beer this is a really good deal."
Lunch time regulars,Regularly go to lunch on weekends for unlimited refills of ice tea and some decent comfort food. Staff is friendly and service is excellent. Not too hot even outside and a great place to people watch. We donâ€™t day drink but needless to say the beer is quite good as well
Can't go wrong!,"Beer superb! Staff friendly, informed and always ready to give recommendations! We went 3 nights in a row!! Not the cheapest but quality has a price and we were happy to pay!!"
Best Burger,"I went here for dinner, I had a burger and the potato skins and it was one of the best burgers Iâ€™ve had! A little on the pricey side but worth it!"
Brewerkz always good and cosnistent,"Part of the Brewerkz conglomerate, it sits right down the end of Orchard near Tanglin and is great for a refreshing beer. Like all mainstream food and alcohol in Singapore it is expensive but the beer is always good and the food the same. They offer specials through the day to make it more appealing. But generally a good consistent brand that continues to deliver and this was no exception."
Local brew pub on Orchard,If you are looking for western food that is less expensive than most other restaurants and cold beer then this is your spot. They have a number of beers available. Fish and chips were good.
Looks better than it is,"Ordered 2 different burgers. Was asked how we'd like it done so we said medium. Both came well done so they were quite dry. Nice plating though.
Service was efficient, but curt. One guy (in red) was bordering on rude, like he did not like his job and did want to be serving people.
Unlikely to go again especially when there are many better alternatives so nearby."
Good food - excellent beer!,One of my favourite places for dinner when staying at the top end of Orchard road. A good choice of pub-style food and a great range of boutique beers. Indoor/outdoor tables with interesting views for people watching with friendly and efficient staff.
Good beer & good burgers,"When I lived in Singapore I used to go to Brewerkz at the Stadium a lot, enjoying the variety of beers and burgers. On this visit 3 years later, we tried the outlet at Tanglin. For a Thursday evening at 8.00 it was nearly empty! We ordered the Golden Ale and burgers. Quick service and good food. All that was missing was the atmosphere! The toilets, shared with other restaurants, were filthy.
I'll try the one at Stadium again next time, to see if more people go there."
Beaut Beer !!,"Visited here on way to and back from Europe for evening drink before dinner.
Attentive friendly service accompanied by very fine craft beer and wines.
Would be nice to have another dark beer on tap, but what they had was excellent.
Did not dine here, but should have as the Chinese restaurant in the Rendezvous left a bit to be desired."
Nice beers brewed,Enjoyed their own delicious wheat beer to wash down a nice half rack of ribs. It's what I wanted and they delivered on it. At the very start of Orchard Road.
Lovely Dinner,Came here on our last night in Singapore. Although they forgot our entree we enjoyed a lovely meal of Steak and ribs. Friendly staff that although it was a busy night they were attentive. Thanks
Good food and service,"Good food and service located on Orchard road, chicken salad and satay to die for extensive beers some brewed by there own brewery worth a visit if in the area"
Late night beverage with the team,"Had a post-Christmas party drink here with our team. Nice service, fun location. Good selection of beers. Overall the team had a good experience"
The only dog friendly place (to my knowledge) in Singapore,"We used to live nearby and occasionally I would meet friends for a drink or a meal at this casual burger restaurant with their own craft beer. This is the only place I am aware of in Singapore where it is not only ok to bring your dog along, but the friendly staff would even provide water."
GOOD SOLID BEER &BURGER,"It's smack on the busy Orchard rd, thus great for people spotting. I had the wagyu burger with fries and their IPA. It's quite a treat to end a busy week."
Good service and reasonably priced for Singapore,We have visited three times for a couple of beers in the past two weeks of our visit to Singapore and have been impressed by the service. The stronger IPA is pretty good and worth a try. Last night we shared quesadillas and fish and chips but they were just okish and nothing special. Iâ€™ll certainly visit again when Iâ€™m back next year
Great value at lunchtime (by Singapore standards),"The lunchtime specials here are actually decent value by Singapore standards. S$15 plus S$5 for a ""pint"" (actually 480ml instead of an actual 568 ml) of which ever of their draft beers takes your fancy. The IPA is pretty good.

I went for the burger but declined the starter (which is included).

Service is OK but not lightning fast, but they did at least provide me with a complimentary glass of water while I was waiting for my friend to arrive.

My burger and fries was actually quite good (except for the bun - which never seems to be good in Asia except Vietnam).

This is probably one of the better lunchtime deals you'll get in Singapore."
***** 5 Star for Craft Beers,"I used to visit Brewerkz to wind down after work. Lovely quiet place with a great selection of craft beers. Very helpful staff.

Can't say about the food as I did not get the chance to try, but the beers are awesome and a must try when visiting Singapore."
Great beer / average food,I visited the place at a Saturday evening. The food choice is limited but the food is OK (3 stars). Beer is great (5 stars)
IPA,Really good selection of beers & friendly staff. Good place. It was nice to be in somewhere where there werenâ€™t loads of dirty men looking over the women outside on the street.
Good quiet place for lunch on orchard road,"we came here a fee times for lunch on week day. Everytime the place is very quiet so we can enjoy a relaxing lunch outdoor.
The food is very good and they change the menu quite regularly. I enjoyed the buddah bowl very much.
The service is always friendly.
We will definitely come back and recommend!"
I had good food.,"Nice small restaurant with good food. Location was perfect, just downstairs of my hotel. Can not remember how expensive, but not bad. I would recommend."
"Craft beer, solid menu and dog friendly","As expats living in Singapore, it has been difficult to find a neighborhood restaurant which will allow our dog to join us. Brewerkz is close tour home in Orchard offering great food, an interesting selection of craft beers all while welcoming our dog. They even bring your dog a water bowl for their hydration. It has become one of our favorite places to go for a family meal out and people watching on Orchard Road. They also have a value priced set lunch menu as well."
Really enjoyed the food here,"Good food, good craft beer and good company with my wife and daughter. A great spot to eat with simple but tasty menu."
They nailed it!,"I am not so easily pleased but this place nailed it for me.
Just dropped by for a casual bite to eat and had the Wagyu burger with cheddar mash and two pints of thier local craft beer......and man I was not disappointed, could not faulty it in any way.....not haute cuisine but excellent beer and a very good burger

Highly recommend!"
Regulars,"We are regulars at Brewerkz on Orchard - almost every Sunday for dinner with with our daughter. We love the beer. My husband loves his cowboy burger. When the burger is actually cooked medium (often too well done but just put make it clear you expect it to be medium and usually works...), I think it is very good. Surprisingly good chips and salsa. Staff is really friendly and pay a lot of attention to our toddler. Family friendly spot and lots of people come with their dogs (which my kid loves)."
"Great craft beer, friendly staff","Iâ€™ve been living out of Orchard Parade Hotel for weeks and this has become my regular spot. The beer is delicious, they have a wide variety, similar to what Iâ€™m accustomed to from craft brew places in the US.
You will pay Singapore beer prices, I advise you to be astonished, realise it is what it is, order a pint or 2 and move on with life. After a few tasty brews you wonâ€™t mind the price.
Food is good, regular bar far or burgers, pizza, wings, etc.
The staff has always been attentive, and as theyâ€™ve gotten to know me donâ€™t even ask what I want as I walk in.
The outside seating is great for people watching, especially at night as you can see Orchard Towers and watch the punters walk in and out."
Underwhelming,"I've been frequenting Brewerkz since they first opened and I have to say the food quality has seemed to declined over the years and my last meal was no exception. We started with the potato skins. They were ok, but lacked any real flavor. My wife ordered the steak, which was an absolute disaster. No seasoning whatsoever; it was if an unprepped cut of meat was simply dropped on the grill. I tried it and agreed with her, probably one of the worse steaks we have had in Singapore. Wagyu burger was ok, but again lacked seasoning. Only redeeming item was the fries, which were well seasoned and crispy. When it was time to pay the bill I asked for the check and then sat and waited for someone to come and collect payment. I finally gave up and had to track someone down."
Clueless Service,"Clueless Service. Asked straightforward question as to when wine bottle by glass opened and met by ""yesterday"" and no further response, further questions answered with""don't know"". Why don't you train your people? Anyway off to the hard rock."
Post-Event Drinks,"Came here with colleagues to sample the beers on offer.
We ended up getting a flight of ales each - IPA's and Pale Ales in the main - but I had one with apricot in it which was really very good.
Nice convenient venue at the slightly (for Singapore) quieter end of Orchard. Great place for a brew!"
dinner for one,enjoyed from home-brews which accompanied baby rack or ribs. Took the double portion which actually is quite a bit (as the ribs are very meaty). But nice and spicy with some fries and coleslaw made a great little dinner with a view on always busy Orchard Road.
Good beer and burgers,"A nice place to have a draft beer and burger. The atmosphere is good and the staff is friendly. The beers are lower abv than in the past, but still good."
Ribs,Best ribs I have ever had so delicious as was the baked potato and coleslaw. Best meal we had in Singapore
Singapore Cold Draft Beer,Casual dining with a smaller menu but good food and cold micro brew beers. The selection is small but there a few good IPA's and an excellent light blonde ale on tap. The nachos are great!!!
Good Beers and Burger,"Great little place. I order the IPA and a Steam beer. Both very good. But if you will only have one, go for the IPA.
I also ordered the Wagyu Burger with chips. It's very good.
And they have nice outside tables, so you can eat, drink and see life pass by.
I recommend."
Nice German Beer Selection,Stopped by for some apps and a couple of beers. The sweet potato fries and onion rings were fine but nothing special. Good beer selection of German style craft brews. We had a 4 beer sampler and the beers were generally pretty good. Nice location with outdoor seating options and friendly servers.
Average meal in a touristy area,"Stopped in for a bite to eat while walking around Orchard. Touristy spot that is quite busy with several restaurants near by. The service was good, the burger was average. The truffle fries were excellent. People watching was also excellent."
Decently Expensive Beer,"We stopped in after walking Orchard Road for an afternoon beer and to get our little guy a snack. After being outside all day, we opted for one of the few indoor air conditioned tables. Our server was prompt and good throughout the experience.

The kids pizza was actually really good sized and came with ice cream - best deal on the menu for $10 SGD. I had the seasonal steam beer which was actually really good and my wife had a 4 beer flight tasting (I was not really a fan of the pilsner). We also ordered a side of french fries to munch on (they were out of the chicken skewers).

At any rate - their beers (as with anywhere in Singapore) are on the expensive end. I think their standard beers are average, but the seasonal or special brews do stand out.

We are glad we stopped in and took and afternoon cheers!"
Year End Routine,"Itâ€™s Been Part of my Life since Brewerkz Came to Singapore. Every December will spend time looking back at the past year & feeling grateful to journey on to another New Year.

Having the Fresh Brew refreshes me & boost my spirits.
Catching up with friends is so enjoyable. Great Place Great Time"
