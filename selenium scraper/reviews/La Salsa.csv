Nice Mexican food and setting,"Big menu choice for food and drinks. We tried the grilled tiger prawns, tacos and fajitas. Comfortable environment for lunch and dinner. Live band on Friday and Saturday nights."
wasted potential,"tatty and shabby
even the waiters looked so unkempt in scrubby t- shirts.

little TLC could improve the place. some clean colorful upholstery on the tired chairs.
the plastiky plates for the tortillas look very unappetizing.

the website is so beautiful and the drawings on the walls are impressive, the bar exposition is magic.

improve the food, the service, and some TLC"
Great food and service,"Me and my hubby Muthukumar was at your restaurant on 30 Dec 2021 and I would like to compliment Ms Usha for her attentiveness and made our dinner experience very pleasant.
This is our first visit and will not be our last as the food is excellent, especially the sauces that comes with the dishes. We enjoyed all the dish we ordered and not forgetting the Margaritas and Aman who makes it. He is really good in making the drinks. Kudos to all of them and hope to see you all soon."
Tasty food and friendly helpful staff,My wife and I are regulars at La Salsa. The food is always very good and so far all of the staff have been genuinely very friendly and helpful.
Three full pitches of frozen margaritas!,"Had three pitches of frozen margaritas for 5 of us! Great refreshing drinks. The nachos, chip and dips, jalapeño poppers, different tacos hard and soft, fajitas, burritos and chimichanga were shared among 7 of us. They all tasted good and awesome. Great menu. End with their churros with chocolate and creamy butter dips. Had to sit outside as the indoors was full. Real popular place with expats as well as locals. Reservations is recommended. Price is on the higher end. Environment is modern Mexicana!"
best frozen margaritas,We tried the different frozen margaritas. They were all very tasty. I highly recommend the fajitas with fine ribeye. It was a nice evening all around.
"Great food. Friendly, helpful staff",The food ws very tasty and not the usual refried beans and rice for everything. Staff were very helpful and gave good recomendations.
New Year’s Eve Dinner at La Salsa Restaurant,"Extremely impressed with La Salsa. Very courteous staff, a tasty Mexican spread and prompt service. Kapil and colleagues are excellent hosts and made our New Year Eve dinner special."
Nice restaurant with good atmosphere,"We had a nice dinner with my wife. We like the ambiance, not too noisy place. The food is pretty with a good choice"
Awesome Mexican fare,Thoroughly enjoyed the authentic Mexican food and loved the ambience too! Will definitely visit again.
Excellent Service and food,"Great service, very friendly and prompt. Margarita, Mexican Coffee is great and food is good too. Will definitely be back again"
Small things make a difference,"One of my usual favorites for TexMex and would have rated this a 4+, however the last time I went with a friend we ordered and appetizer and two pitchers of Margaritas. The bill came to 150+ which was fine as the margaritas are amazing; however we were offered a refill on chips and once they found out we had paid, they wanted to charge me another 8 dollars for some tortillas. I must admit, if it was my restaurant I would have responded with happy to get you some more sir! Understanding that the waitress was unable to take this call, I asked for the manager, who I see speaking with the waitress, and instead of coming over, simply walked away. Well, needless to say, not sure I plan to return here again. NOW, this experience aside, the food is really good as are the drinks. Affordable too!"
Good food and ambiance,"Hi, walked in without reservations. Great food and ambiance. I really like to beef steak and the soft shell crab tacos, The Margaritas was great too! The bar Tender and server was excellent!"

Authentic & Cosy Gem at Dempsey,"Delicious food, great ambience & awesome service! This is my first time here and my family and I personally love the Queso Fundido appetizer with nachos and just can't stop eating that! The tacos and quesadilla were also very tasty and servings of cheese were generous , especially in the tiger prawn chimichanga which we ordered later in the evening. Magaritas were on point and their service is just amazing! Will defintely return to try their wagyu meatball fujita and chicken flauta the next time round. Thanks for the great service once again :)"
"Amazing Food, Ambience and Service","The food, the staff and the ambience of la salsa is so amazing that it’s become a regular go-to place for us! The musicians add an amazing touch :) The queso fundido is a must try and to die for! A must-go for anyone in Singapore"
Great lunch experience,The food was good and the portions were substantial. The staff were friendly and helpful. We love the ambience. The Fajitas were out of this world. The tacos - have not tasted better ones elsewhere.
Reunion Dinner,Nice Margarita Drinks and awesome Mexican food. Lime and Mango flavor are recommended. Nice ambient and music.
We enjoyed our dine-in experience,We enjoyed our dine-in experience. Great food and friendly service. Food portions are big. We will definitely go back!
Tacos and churros,"Quite pleasantly surprised with a walk in dinner. Decent atmosphere on the patio with pub height dining. We ordered the jalepeno poppers, al pastor tacos and chicken flautas. All items were well prepared, came out hot and we were happy with the flavours and authenticity on each plate. Overall flavour level on everything was well combined and not overdone, with quite a fresh taste. Finished the meal off with churros and felt that they were freshly prepared and very good!"
Nice and cosy,"Love to come here for Mexican food. Food is good. Tacos, chips, ribs are all recommended. Good ambience. They used to have a band playing here. Currently no band due to covid situation."
Great place!,Great ambience and food! Especially liked the abundance of veggie options and service was quick and with a smile. Will definitely go again!
Perfect for Chill Nights,Casual Mexican restaurant with a chill vibe. Perfect for group gatherings or a chill date night. Love the two resident cats in the al fresco area.
Excellent Mexican Food!,Our whole family loved the food here. The ingredients were so fresh and one of the best Mexican food we have had in Singapore. Loved the relaxing ambience and the best customer service. Looking forward to coming back soon !
Authentic Mexican Cuisine.,Authentic Mexican Cuisine. Great service. Excellent ambience. Definitely a place to visit again. Keep up the great service n food.
Dinner at La Salsa,The ambiance was aesthetically pleasing and the service at the restaurant was great! Their magaritas we really good! :)
Best Fajita’s,"Great service, the chicken nachos and the Steak Fajita’s where very good. The manager and staff where fantastic !"
Mok,Great service as I did a walk in on a Friday night. They accommodate me with a seat and make e best arrangement. Food n wine selection are good.
Nice ambiance and great service,Not to mention great food too... one of our favourite place which never fails to impress us with great service
Good Job La Salsa,"The quesadillas were really good! Food and drinks were affordable, not forgetting the excellent service from the staff. 10/10 recommend. Would love to come here again! Thank you for the churros!!"
Unhygienic restaurant would not recommend,"Had a terrible experience today from the beginning of the meal.
1. We sat on the table and picked up unwashed, dirty knife from the cutlery basket.
2. Went to the restroom to wash hand before meal but it did not have soap - manager offered us to use alcohol hand sanitizer instead and did not fill up the soap
3. We ordered prawn taco and found a very sharp foreign matter inside the food that my boyfriend bit into.

To be fair, they waived the price of tacos, but it was a very disappointing restaurant. Would never dine there again, given the unhygienic experience we have had."
Great food with awesome customer service,The food was good and served hot. The portion was very generous. Their crab cakes especially was so moist and delicious! Customer service was excellent! Will patronize again for sure!
Dinner,Cosy setting with great food! Recommend the Fujita especially! We had the wagyu meatball Fujita. Would definitely visit again!
Friday Night dinner,Cosy good ambience friendly staffs and nice Mexican food with yummy butterscotch sauce and a good date night restaurant!!
Mexican delight,Tried tiger prawns chimichunga! Awesome! Queso Fundido was out of the world!! A Must try apperizer!! Pork ribs is actually quite good too I heard
Best Mexican in Singapore!,"Best Mexican in Singapore! Singapore is not a hub for Latin American dining, but this place serves some pretty darn good Mexican food."
Great food,Came here after circuit breaker and had a great family dinner. The food is really tasty and the ambience is nice. Would definitely come back again!
Celebration!,"It was the first time we were meeting our friend after 2 months of Circuit Breaker and we were feeling a bit of Mexican. We patronised La Salsa for dinner and the Pescado Taco and Chicken Quesadilla were really good. The Taco Al Pastor was a bit dry though. Also had a really good pitcher of Classic Frozen Margarita that we shared and we had a good time overall. Only thing was they didn’t have any music on but they did play some after we requested for it, but only sporadically."
Value for money!,Great service and good food - frozen margaritas were solid! Tacos pastor should be an order. Good place for a date
Awesome Mexican food & Insta-worthy venue,Delicious Mexican food & great ambience! Love their generously portioned Chimichanga (deep-fried burrito). Their margaritas & ceviche are superb too.
The best thing was the margarita,"Yes, the margarita was really good. We had a pitcher. The food not so much. I wonder if the kitchen has ever tasted real Mexican food. Queso Flameado was a sad combination of cheese whiz and some bland thing that was supposed to be chorizo but wasn't. The chicken quesadilla lacked flavor. It was filling but unremarkable. Outside seating was really pleasant. I would recommend coming here for a margarita and sitting outside."
Quite disappointing,"Ordered fajitas for main dish. Strange sourly, flat, dry taste. No cream or guacamole offered as part of dish. Hardly any chopped tomatos. For 28 sgd excluding service and tax overpriced.
Get your act together Salsa !!"
Average food. Very overpriced,"Visited with friends for lunch. We should have suspected that the restaurant was lit great given that we were the only occupied table in the restaurant throughout the meal.

Service was fast. However food was fairly mediocre- the quesadillas lacked flavour, the jalapeño poppers were doughy and didn’t really taste of much. The tacos were good. Ordered some cocktails which were terrible and when we complained we were told that we had bad taste!

For the food quality it was very expensive. Many better Mexican restaurants in Singapore- I wouldn’t visit again."
Authentic mexican food,"If you want an authentic mexican food try la salsa. We ordered queso flameado for our starter which was really good and mouthwatering, we also had pork chimichangas which was served generously. Fajitas was also a good portion. Their carne asada ribeye was one of their best seller. All food was nice and is for sharing. The staff was very accommodating and and attentive. Will recommend to our friends who fancy athentic mexican food."
Authentic and delicious Mexican food,"La salsa has a new menu which serves up authentic Latin food that is both delicious and appealing to the eyes. The arepas were moist and soaked up the tantalising meat stew. Enchiladas were nicely done as well. The nachos went well with their homemade salsas, try their spicy cheese sauce as well. Last but not least their margaritas are a hit and they do put a bit of hard liquor inside for those of you alcoholics out there. All in all, a good experience!"
Great Mexican & South American fare served in colourful ambience!,"La Salsa offered us more than we bargained for! The range of South American Veggie options they’ve added needs to be lauded. We started with Chips with a whole range of exotic dips, accompanied by a jar of Margarita drink. For the main course, we opted for Mofongo, a PeurtoRican dish of mashed fried plantains in a rich Cuban stew. Our second choice was Hongos Portobello Asados, a flame grilled marinated portobello mushrooms with stuffing, served with Spanish rice. The mushrooms were simply delicious! For dessert, we opted for Churros. The ambience was colourful & cheerful and a face artist helped a few of us put on face paintings to add to the unique cheer of the evening! Truly a memorable outing, it turned out for one & all, adults and kids! Highly recommended."
Awesome Mexican food in Dempsey,"Good food, great service. The ceviche and prawn chimichanga are highly recommended! There’s live music on some nights."
Need To Train Your Wait Staffs,"We went there tonight & was told that per pint is $5 by an Indian waitress as it's happy hour between 12 to 8pm. I asked what kinda pint & it was the big pint!! So it can be Tiger, Heineken or Guinness. After 6 pints + chicken wings that was close to $89. After I got home then I realised what I wasn't informed correctly. Imagine if I had a certain budget? Please train your staffs properly as mis-selling ain't good for consumers! So per pint is $10+!"
Nice food but not value for money,Would have given a 4 star across all categories if not for the price. Portion is small. Definitely not value for money. Quality of food and service is good though.
Dinner @ La Salsa,A quiet ambience and quick service! Definitely would recommend their chimichangas! Will come again 😁😁
Excellent,"We had a good time at La Salsa; great drinks, the Cadillac in particular. Great staff- David & the rest of the staff were really warm and welcoming! Ambience was excellent, felt like I was in Latin America for the evening. Cheers!"
Good Food,Lechon Asado is done in a perfectly serve with chimichurri sauce . I love the chimichanga with tiger prawn.
Great service. Disappointing food.,"Visited on a Tuesday evening when it was fairly quiet. Service was very friendly and efficient.

Unfortunately the food was mixed - the chimichanga was good but the burritos and churros were very disappointing. The burritos tasted fairly limp and was really soggy. I think the rice was overcooked. The churros were heavy and very doughy."
Lunch,"Delicious food and great ambience! We had prawn ceviche, pulled pork and paella. David was our friendly host who served us very well. Will be back!"
Lunch @ La Salsa,Good food;very well portioned. Staff are attentive and engaging. Enjoyable lunch in a nice ambient setting.
Dinner,"The food is simply wonderful. Staff service is excellent. Ambient is nice and relax. Best Mexican food in Singapore. Must try the burritos, kitchen sink!"
Great birthday dinner for Dad!,We bought our dad here for his 73rd birthday with the family. The food was great. Dad enjoyed the angus steak the most. Staff also surprised the birthday ‘boy’ with a pudding topped with a birthday candle. It’s always a pleasure to dine here. The staff is always warm and welcoming.
Great Mexican food!!,"Great food, greater service and all round fantastic experience. Everything surpassed our expectations from the Enchilladas that we ate to the Margaritas that we drank. Oh and yes a live singer with an amazing voice to boot! What a great time!"
farewell for a friend,This is our second time coming back. Service and food were as good as the first time. The waiter taught us some Spanish as well.
Good Time at La Salsa,Had a great time at La Salsa. The food was great and the staff friendly and approachable. Aishah and Sonia were absolutely amazing. Thank you guys so much!
Love the new look and menu!,"We came here with friends, who were visiting. We chose La Salsa, as it’s always been a place where we can count on the food and live music. It has been a while since we came, so we were not only pleasantly surprised with the enhanced look, but also the enhanced menu. Lots of new options, great variety in taste and the use of colors."
Perfect Place to Dine,"Excellent service, great ambience, fantastic Mexican menu! Kudos to John for the excellent service. We came here to celebrate a friend's retirement and we were not disappointed! We also appreciated the privacy of the place."
Cozy & Family,Lovely ambience and friendly staffs. Highly recommended for family and friends outing. We had the piping hot churros at the start. Good start 😉
💯,"Customer service was awesome, many varieties of food which tasted amazing. Bartender makes killer cocktails. Would definitely visit this place again!"
fabulous evening!,"Had a lovely dinner with my family. My 5 year old nephew loved the food too. The ambience is fabulous, the food was delicious. By far, the best Mexican we have had so far in singapore. The nachos with the dips and the quesadillas were super yummy! And the service - one of the best we have seen in any restaurant here. Both John and Gella were excellent. Super attentive, friendly and efficient. We will be back soon!"
Hearty and tasty dinner,Enjoyed the Totopos con Chile and Langostinos al Adobo which we ordered using the Burpple Beyond 1 for 1 promotion. Both steak and prawns were cooked perfectly and full of flavour and the portions were generous! Super worth it and we will be coming back again to try more dishes on La Salsa’s extensive menu :-)
Awesome food!!,"If you are looking for authentic, flavorful and yummy Mexican food with great ambience.. this is the place!!"
Review La Salsa,Ambience was nice. Food quality was good. Portions a tad small. We had the restaurant to ourselves for an early reservation
Good Mexican restaurant,"We had the Arepas with Ropa Vieja, Char-Grilled Pescado and Seafood Ceviche with a Red Sangria and Lime Margarita. Food was good!"
Great service and good food,After visiting an exhibition nearby we enjoyed a meal at Salsa. The friendly and helpful service was quick and efficient. The grilled salmon and the quesadilla was very nice. We recommend the place for everyone who likes Mexican cuisine.
Lunch @ La Salsa,Brilliant ambience and service from the staff! Food was well prepared and cooked. Would definitely reccomend to people who love spicy and Mexican food!
Disappointed that it went downhill,"I loved la salsa the very first time I ate there. Went back many times to eat their crab enchilada. Went back today again, but they changed the menu. The food was not up to standard.
the quality vs the price:
Quality went downhill and the price remained as expensive.

Had the Snapper and the beef rib. Both were disappointing. the snapper tasted unfresh and there’s a frozen taste in the fish. The beef rib was not fantastic either.

We were offered a free churros dessert to make our dining experience better."
Omg!!,"The worst ever lunch experience in Dempsey hill, let me break it down as follows:

1: soap in the beer glasses
2: chicken wings with blood
3: chicken wings burnt

It’s like no one cares and we as the paying public should accept such mediocrity!!

Advice!! Best to stay away!!!"
Mexican Cravings!! Value for Money,Great food...staffs are well trained and knows the menu pretty well. The empanadas and the wagyu fajitas are so nice and the portions can feed up to 3 pax. Visit on Friday for some live music!
Fantastic food & service,"Great crab n lobster tacos, spicy mussels. Restaurant had a chill vibe with good live music, and superb service from mike that put a smile on all our faces!!"
"Great Mexican food, cosy ambiance, excellent service",The food was authentic with great portioning and arrived with barely any waiting time. Great place for families as staff is helpful and attentive but not pushy. Ambiance is wonderful with interesting decoration in the Mexican theme. Not our first time and definitely not our last.
Revamped menu & friendly people,"Good tacos, tangy & fresh tasting! The food is generally good. The atmosphere is cozy and is a good place to chill. Recommended."
Excellent service!,"The service at La Salsa was fantastic, my friend and I were served promptly and staff were very efficient in getting orders and service. They are very friendly and it was nice to be able to start a conversation with ease. Keep up the good work, loved the churros!"
Good food not to be missed!,"The food at La Salsa is absolutely great and the service is excellent, not to mention the ambience of the place.
John, who attended to us has such a fantastic personality and great custoner service with greater sense of humour.
His recommendations of food and drinks is truly to our liking!
Had a fabulous time at La Salsa!"
Dinner date,Great ambience. Absolutely love the food. Mike was our server and he was super attentive. He took his time to introduce the mains and recommended some good choices. Do ask for specials :)
Great Monday dinner,Came on a Monday for dinner and drinks with colleagues. Great ambience and food (just that one of our order was left out and had to remind). Recommend the crab and lobster taco!
Great food and service,We were not so exposed to Mexican food prior to coming here. Servers john and mike were very patient and helpful with describing menu items to suit our dietary requirements. The food was amazing and the service was prompt. Will definitely come back again
One of the best places in Singapore,"We go here very often, to relax and have some drinks and food after work. Super attentive staff and the food is very good. Can’t miss this one when you go to Dempsey!"
Worst experience ever for 3 years in Singapore,"Run away
if you want to eat good Mexican food, please go next door to Marguerita's at least you'll be considered, treated as a client and get your dishes on time and not after 2 h!
Run away"
Disappointed,"Used to be our favourite Mexican restaurant but was shockingly disappointed in our latest visit. Menu was totally changed and it has very limited choices of Mexican dishes now. The wait for food was long though there were only 3 tables (including us) occupied. A small basket of chips with 5 small dipping sauce costed $25. The steak came charred black and chewy though had asked to be done in medium well.

Definitely not coming back with the asking price for this kind of food quality and service."
Dinner,"The food is excellent especially the beef short rib while the nachos are freshly made , thin and crispy. The waiters are very friendly and attentive making the whole dining experience a wonderful one!"
Abit of Mexico in Singapore.,"Good selection of food. The guac and salsa were great. Service was good, they were able to accommodate some requests (mixed fajitas, and also recommended some off the menu items). A little pricey."
