Friendly service,"Good service by Chris (Manager) Wild mushroom soup is a must-try. ++ for a suprised birthday cake, thank you."
Love the food,delicious food great atmosphere for birthday celebrations. Staff was extremely helpful in service and singing birthday song
Top notch service and yummy goodness,"From the entr√©e to desserts, we were presented with visually aesthetic and tasty dishes. To say we were satisfied is an understatement.
Strongly recommend the chef‚Äôs special - some meat dish that‚Äôs soft and tender. Also their signature Macaroni n Cheese - best in town hands down! Gotta try their truffle fries, wild mushroom soup and bruschetta‚úÖ
Lest we forget, there‚Äôs the cr√®me br√ªl√©e, tiramisu, pink drink and salted caramel latte. We have every intention of coming back for more‚Ä¶ and soon! Shout out to Khai/Kyle for the outstanding service!"
Amazing service and positive response to feedback (regarding the consistency of food quality),"Visited Positano Risto for about 4 to 5 times and have always returned for the pesto pasta. Today‚Äôs pasta texture was slightly watery (& was not topped with cherry tomato) so we gave our feedback to one of the staff and he was generous to have given us a dessert as a service recovery.

Truly a fulfilling dine-in everytime I return here. Thank you Positano Risto! :)"
Awesome service by Yazid and team!,"1st time coming here and got to say I didn‚Äôt really imagine the food will be this nice. the portion, the presentation, the cleanliness, the yumminess ü§© the customer service was above expectations too! Definitely coming back to get service again from Yazid and team!"
Positively Positano!,"Our family had a couple of the Signature Lobster dishes which were sumptuous, delicious and very filling. Service was knowledgeable and helpful as well. We'll be back."
Birthday celebration,"Such a good and chill place to have a birthday celebration. Our server Khai was attentive to our needs and regularly checked back on us without being overbearing.

We ordered the arancini, strip loin, gnocchi and tiramisu. Received a sponge cake covered in caramel sauce as a birthday surprise which was so good!

Arancini - nicely breaded and crispy. Cheese and rice combination really flavorful

Striploin - cooked in the doneness we requested. Meat was so soft!

Gnocchi - soft and pillowy gnocchis. Cheese and truffle always works. Reallyyy good

Birthday cake haha - sponge cake covered in caramel sauce. Very decadent! Appreciated the slighty burnt notes of the caramel sauce cz it can be slightly too sweet

Tiramisu - so light and a perfect end to a meal. Better to pre order to avoid missing out!

Cucumber cooler - soo refreshing!

Salted caramel iced latte - soo smooth and just the perfect sweetness. Loved it

All in all such a great evening made even better with the best service from Khai.

Thank you so much!"
The Go-to Halal Restaurant,"Brought my wife here for her birthday and it was just the perfect evening.

Arancini balls - to die for
Striploin steak - the right temp, elegant seasoning; go for the bone marrow butter; they should bottle it up and sell it!
Gnocchi - pillowy, creamy, perfect portion
Tiramisu - one is not enough; it‚Äôs that good! but best to pre-order to avoid missing out

Cucumber cooler - Fresher than the Prince of Bel-Air; must get
Salted caramel coffee - the best! Smoother than Michael Jackson

They also served a surprise sponge cake drenched in sexy caramel sauce for my wife‚Äôs birthday.

And if you thought the food is amazing, the service was on another level. we were served by the personable Khai, who made the mains much tastier and the desserts much, much sweeter. This chap deserves a raise!

Kudos Positano, we‚Äôll definitely be back"
Cosy Chillax Dinner date,"Upon arriving at entrance,greeted by Positano staff with smile..Khai attended to us with professionalism yet approachable with our questions regarding about menu. He will check in asking how our food, even updating us when our food will be arriving..thats a plus point.A gold gem to Positano team.ambience is cosy and Positano staff are always running the floor attending to every customer needs and wants. Highly recommended to have a special moment or casual dinner dates.."
Great food with excellent service,"My wife and I came here for dinner. We had the steak and cheeseburger. Although the doneness of the steak was not what we requested for, they promptly replaced it and the steak was amazing. Cheeseburger was really good too!

Shout out to Khai, who was serving us through the night. He was polite, attentive, and offered us dessert to celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday. He definitely made our experience here great and we felt well taken care of.

We both had a really good experience here and would definitely come back again."

Pleasant experience @ Positano Risto!,"Visited Positano Risto with my partner for our 6th Anniversary as we had a pleasant experience during our previous visit here for our 5th Anniversary. Just as expected, we had a wonderful time here, served by Khai throughout our dinner. Our food was served promptly & everything was fresh and flavourful. Khai was really friendly and helpful. He came over to our table to check on us and our food a couple of times & ensure the food is up to standards. He even served us a surprise sponge cake to celebrate our anniversary! It really made the overall experience here really great & we would definitely return with other friends and family members. Kudos to the team at Positano Risto for making our anniversary dinner memorable!"
Anniversary dinner,"Food was delicious as always, the lobster bisque was a little salty but still familiar from the last time we visited. The service provided by Khai and his mates were 10/10 and special thanks to him for surprising us w a complimentary sponge cake!! Will always try to come here for any special occasions."
Good food. Grazie mille!,"Had a great experience being attended by Yazid, who had experience in F&B and used that to enhance food flavours that I ordered. He made great recommendations and my steak was moist and full of flavour. Medium-rare steak was exceptionally well. Zero meat stuck in-between teeth. Thumbs up.

What caught my attention was, those who attended to my table (24), paid attention to who ordered what food and presented that ordered item to the customer with grace and smile. They also attentively cleared plates on my table. This is very much lacking in Singapore F&B and this restaurant did it. Grazie Mille! Keep up with this quality service and you will succeed."
Best place to celebrate birthdays and anniversary!,This is our 4th time here! We celebrated birthdays and anniversaries here. The foods were delicious and fulfilling. Thank u Khai & Yazid for the great services & the hospitality <3

Food and Service Review,"The food was outstanding, service was amazing, especially Chris. Lobster was sweet and fresh, striploin steak melts in your mouth. Honey short rib was super tender, and the lasagne is probably a favourite for cheese lovers. Creme brulee was a favourite and they gave complimentary birthday cake of caramel brownie. They were superb tonight and most definitely will come back again."

Khai‚Äôs service was professional and very good; and was able to provide the advice and recommendations based on our preference and eating capacity.

Great food, war service and an unforgettable birthday celebration with wife and kids at Positano!

A gem not to be missed!"
Compliment,"I celebrated my wife's bday here and it was amazing. The food is amazing. Loving the beef ragu linguine and the arancini balls! Ordered the cucumber cooler, so refreshing but i think the cucumber is better off slices rather than smashed as the seed and the little bits of the cucumber will be stuck to the straw at some point. Your waiter, khai was amazing too! Constantly coming to our table to make sure we are satisfied with our orders. Promote him!"
Compliments,I celebrated my birthday with my husband here and we both had an amazing time. We enjoyed the aracini balls very much. The norweigian salmon linguine was good but i think itd look more pleasant as a fillet than chopped. But overall food taste was great! We had Khai serving us and he was so so helpful and just really tip top customer service from Khai. Thank you Khai!
Excellent food and service,"Shoutout to Yazid for being such a great host! Food was so good, made my weekend! Happy 5 year anniversary!"
Birthday lunch,"We ordered the gnocchi and wild mushroom lingune. It was very nice and satisfying to our tastebuds.

Wild mushroom soup was flavourful but would love if the bread was more.

Mozzarella ball was nice to. The pomodro sauce really complements the taste.

Tiramisu is a must have for a tiramisu lover. We also received a complimentary sticky date cake which is very warm and soft.

Staff was very friendly too.

Would come again for sure, insyaAllah."
