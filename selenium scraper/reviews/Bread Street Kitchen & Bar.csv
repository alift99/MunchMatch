Yummy,Magnificent service and a variety of delicious food to try. We really enjoyed dining in and the dessert is superb must try.
Above average quality restaurant,"Delicious food, and beautiful presentation. Too bad they don't serve small portions of Wellington beef"
Worth a visit!,"We ordered quite a few starters and a set of beef wellington. Portion was quite big and was a lot for two pax! Recommended to go empty stomach and take it easy w the starters, just get the Wellington first!"
"Good food, amazing service","The service is exceptional and as good as any fine dinning restaurant.

The food isn't amazing but it is good and reasonably price for upmarket pub food.

The burgers were a bit of a disappointment, lacking seasoning, meat was good but not juicy, average pickle.

Good but not great.

Very good fish and chips.

Fries are more memorable than the burger."
Wedding Anniversary,Spent my 3rd year wedding anniversary at the restaurant. Presentation and Food was great. Very nice place to spend with your loved ones
Fish n chips,"Sometimes the popular fish n chips is sold out. To think most want to try the crispy battered, moist insides fish, and gorgeous chucks of potato. Sadly this dish can sell out midway through lunch service."
Good Grub and Service,"The food here is really good with rather large portions, so those help to justify the price tag. The service is attentive and very friendly, even had a chat with the Manager Daniel. Will have to go back with a larger appetite for the Beef Wellington!"
Another Strike Out in Singapore,"This was a really disappointing experience. I am a fan of Ramsay as a TV personality but had never tried his food. For such a loud, arrogant person you would expect his food would match his attitude. It did not.
Every dining experience starts with the host or hostess, this lady was as miserable as i have seen them. She must have been having a bad day, but her attitude was terrible. We were walk ins and she mumbled 'only bar seats'. We had a look ourselves as she waited impatiently. She needs some serious training in hospitality. That started us off on a sour note, thankfully all the wait staff and bartenders were friendly and pleasant enough. For a place that is going to charge you an arm and a leg to eat there, it does leave much to be desired in terms of the level of service provided, but it was good enough i suppose. Food wise it wasn't good. The wings were chewy and poorly seasoned, the sauce just isn't great. We had some chicken salad that wasn't bad, best dish of the day which is pretty sad. I had the butter chicken, which was awful, it wasn't a curry at all, an embarrassment to Indian cuisine. It was literally chicken in tomatoe sauce, my 5 yo could do better than that. The rice was over cooked and bland. The pork belly itself wasn't too bad but the skin was extremely tough and salty, another failure! Overall, it was just a poor dining experience and i wouldn't eat here again. It is a shame, and i guess Gordon is just more concerned with making money now than he is with serving quality food. I can see management doesn't even bother responding to the reviews which shows their total lack of care and concern as well. Another dismal meal in Singapore, sadly it happens far too often for such a place."
One of the best in Singapore,Superb! I cant complain. It’s reasonably priced and not expensive at all! My goal is too try everything on the menu so I will keep coming back to this restaurant.
Family CNY dinner,We were seated at the main dining hall with great views. Food takes slighly longer to be served but not a big issue. We enjoyed our dinner.
First Class dining at Marina Bay Sands,"Did not disappoint. Delicious, delectable dining which is a must visit if you come to Singapore. It was a hard choice between roasted cod, the burger and Beef Wellington - Gordon R signature dish. None fell short in portion size or taste. The Tuna and Soup starter equally delicious. We finished the meal with the Pineapple and Kiwi carpaccio, cheesecake, sticky toffee pudding and a selection of ice creams and sorbets. A great night out eating for all."
Not a good advert for Gordon,"We booked this for a Chinese New Year dinner and had a booking at 9.15 pm for set menu for CNY. Arrived on time ordered promptly and then we are told restaurant closes at 10.30. Food from set menu Chicken salad was over spiced and not edible.Beef Wellington has a wait time of 45 mins on menu bit difficult when we only have 45 mins before closing. Beef wellington is normally served rare the said. We said we wanted medium please. It was not hot. It had gristle veins running through it. Next table had beef which they were not able to cut. Desert was pineapple with ice cream which was ok but nothing special. Wine Malbec was good as was Meantime beer. Toilets are in the public area of Expo, leave the restaurant on the other side of the shopping mall. Yes we did get a reduction at the time. We have eaten in Heddon Street London which Singapore is based on. Gordon just shut this place down as it doesn’t reflect your high standards. Would we return. Not a chance."
Celebrating my son graduation in his favorite chef restaurant.,"One of my son favorite chefs is Gordon Ramsay, he's so happy that he will eat beef wellington , indeed he was. It's all getting much better from the choices of menu, ambience & the staff service. Please keep the quality up!"
Nice Lunch,Good meal & view in the afternoon. We enjoyed both the main dish but today was informed there was no free flow of bread compared to past.
Not worth the hype,"Booked the restaurant the same day we booked our flight to Singapore but we were so disappointment. The service was slow. I understand that it is the peak period but it really is not that hard to serve the food once it's ready. The fish and chips are really good, I'll give them that. Serving portion matched the price."
NOT Impressed!,"We booked this restaurant looking forward to eating here!
On entering the restaurant we found a stale smell meeting us and sat at the bar having a drink
We then went to our table. Our starter was lovely and we were looking forward to our main.
I went to the toilet amd saw our meal sitting on the bar . I returned and it was still sitting there! We were then served it and it was cold !
The staff changed it without a problem.
We were actually underwhelmed by the whole experience. The waiter said Gordon had only been once since ot opened and never returned!
Wouldn't return as there are much better options in Singapore!"
Wonderful experience at mum's favorite restaurant,"First time to the restaurant and mum finally got to try the highly raved fish & chips. It was huge and fresh, fries was superb. Rest of the food was great but probably a little overpriced for small portion of salad."
"Never fails to,please",The staff are excellent. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great and the food always excellent. Always a good choice of food. The steaks are particularly good and they always try to cook them to your requirements
Worth a visit,"Beef wellington was good. Staff service was excellent.

Seems like the wait for food can be long. The beef wellington has a 45 minute wait time which is expected, but other tables that ordered other food items also had wait times comparable to mine.

Might be a one-off, but an observation nonetheless. Still worth a visit."
Good food and service,"Overall food is very good. Ordered chicken wings, wellington beef and dessert for malt whisky cheese cake with sorbet. The main and appertizer are really well done, though it's a long wait for the wellington beef but all is worth while. The wellington beef portion is a bit too big for 2 of us as we're both small eater. Will bring more friends/family to share if we're to visit again. Dessert is fantastic, the cheese cake is smooth and taste even better when matched with sorbet. The cocktails are smooth and well balanced, we ordered Memoir of Love and it taste so good we couldn't help but ordered a second glass. Staff are friendly and helpful, appreciated that table were cleared and cleaned for every dish served. Overall it's a good experiene and will definitely visit again."
Quality of Food is Going Down,The service is great as the staffs have always been attentive. But the price for the food and its quality. Not worth it anymore. It is not the same food when we started eating in this restaurant. I don’t think I will be dining again. There are other places that charge the same amount and have better food quality.
Thet Wai,"Cocktails are lovely… Foods are fantastic… Bread basket is a must have item. Overall.. we enjoy all the foods, services & ambience."
Great lunch,"Great lunch , food were excellent but prices on the high side . We enjoy ! Staff are great too ! Will return again"
Service is Excellent,"it was a good place the bread is good and presentation, but food it was kinda disappointing for the value of money. esp we got the waffle and it was just soggy and maybe left out for few minutes already at the counter. just sad as we wanted a good experience with Gordon Ramsey's restaurant."
Classic Gordon Rasmey Restaurant but disappointing meal,"We visited Bread Street Kitchen as I love Gordon Ramsey and always have amazing meals at his restaurants. Service was great on arrival. We started with the crispy duck salad which was amazing. We then ordered the beef wellington, the side dishes were great however we ordered it medium but unfortunately out of the 4 pieces we got 2 pieces medium and then 2 pieces that were well done, the staff were condescendingly explaining that this is because that's the way the Wellington works, the ends are a bit more overcooked and that someone has to get the ends. This was extremely disappointing, I would expect at a restaurant of this calibre, paying a lot of money for a meal, for the wellington to arrive exactly as ordered and not have to hope to be lucky to not get the ends.

Overall the restaurant was nice, the salad was great, the sides were nice and the 2 pieces of wellington were perfect however unfortunately that situation soured the experience a little bit."
"Good food, good place","Want to make reservation but it was full, so I try to walk in and got the bar table. It was nice too can see outside view & have dinner.
The food portion was big. Me & my kids cannot finish them all
Taste was very nice"
Olive and Kiana,"These two servers were the absolute best! We were a little fearful of bringing our three young boys to the restaurant but we really wanted to try Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant of beef Wellington! Im so glad we decided to brave it because the restaurant had kid friendly menus and even little activities for them to do. Olive and Kiana made it easy and put our minds at ease by being so welcoming, understanding, and so helpful for a family of 5!

And of course… the food and drinks did not disappoint!"
Celebrate 1 Jan 2023!,Had a great experience for the very first time! Had heard a lot about it and it was unexpected’WOW’. Will definitely come back to have their Signature BEEF WELLINGTON ✨
Enjoyed the delicious food,"My niece from Melbourne visited Singapore in December. She wanted to try out Mr.Ramsey's restaurant at MBS.
We made reservation 2 weeks in advance and only secured lunch slot at 230pm.

On the day, we were served by a friendly waiter Mr.Siva who took care of us very well.

We ordered
: Mac & Chesse
: Roasted cod
: Super food salad

The food was delicious & super food salad is my must ordered dish.
My niece enjoyed her roasted cod

I wish they will bring back the plant base burger.
The other vegetarian options (other than super food salad)
: margherita pizza
: cauliflower steak
: plant base welington

As expected the pricing is at the higher range, i personally find it is acceptable range with the quality food, attentive service & good view.

Will i be back? YES , definately :)

Regards
ML Leong
Singapore"
Good food,Not as good as some of the other Bread Streets but the food is great. Service is average but they are very busy.
You can never have too much Beef Wellington.,"Visited Bread Street Kichen mainly because of how many times we've seen Gordon Ramsey rip on Hell's Kitchen contestants about their Beef Wellingtons. It was our first time trying out this dish, and suffice to say, it won't be our last. The combination of the fluffy pastry and tasty beef was a delight to the senses. Will definitely be back again."
One of the worst meals I've had in a long time,"Avoid this restaurant when in Singapore. The over-priced burger was raw and inedible - in fact, so bad they gave it to me for free. The service was mediocre. They're simply trading on a name. There are plenty of better places."
Company 10th anniversary dinner @ Bread street,"Nice food, good quality! It's a pity, dinning time is constraint. We could hv ordered dessert, but had to skip due to being rushed to leave for next pax to come."
Good experience,"Overall a good experience, food is yummy, staff is helpful and friendly. Value for money, slightly no. 🤣"
Ridiculously good,Overall a great experience - highly recommended Food awesome Good service Well organized A few wines out of stock leaving only really expensive options
Good food with great service!,"Had a wonderful experience at Bread Street. Food was delicious and service was great! Special mention to GM Mr. Navin Raj for making our visit a memorable one. 👏🏼👍🏼. Also, the sticky toffee pudding is a must try!"
yummy,"really enjoy the food over there, althought the ambience is slightly noisy, overall is good and staff are friendly and helpful."
Superb!,We enjoyed our meal. The food is awesome and the ambiance is so relaxing. Servers are friendly and accommodating.
Food was Ok but they served my drink with a fly in it!,"Good food Good ambiance Bad Service
They made us wait for 30 mins even to get drinks,. The food was good but my drink had a fly in it. When I reported that the server took the drink away but still charged us for it. Was expecting better from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant!"
The Beef Wellington!,Been wanting to come and try the famous Beef Wellington for years. Finally managed to snag a table for a birthday lunch. Very delicious dish - more than enough for 3 of us even though the menu states that it is good for 2 persons!
Great experience,The staff were friendly and food was great! But slightly pricey for what it is but I didn’t try the wellington. Gonna do that next time I go.
Lovely visit,Our visit to Bread street kitchen was a lovely affair. Food was delicious and well presented. The staff was also nice and thoughtful. they noticed we were feeling cold and helped to adjust the air conditioning.
Bar are seat with a view,"First time having a bar area seat with a view along Singapore River..Nice! Wine and Dine. Champagne, Roasted Code with Artichoke and Mashed Potato."
Enticing meal/place to celebrate (Birthday!),"Reminders (email, call) - sent on a timely manner. The reserved table at nice location (2nd flr). The appetizer, starter meal - served nicely. main meal - we've changed our first option (Wellington) as waiting time is 45mins. The burger is one of a kind, so far the best for us - takeaway mine and was eaten the following morning, the meat/burger patty still juicy. Cocktail was a nice pair to end the meal. Thank you and surely, there will be a 2nd time!"
Frustration at every level,"Extremely frustrating experience: restaurant half empty, came alone to have a 30min lunch and was told they’d only honor reservations for lack of capacity. Been coming here for years and will never go back! Avoid at all costs"
Delicious lunch with amazing view,The salad and beef wellington are excellent. Service is super too. The server is super friendly and attentive. The price is bit high but worth it. Sgd 300 for two starter and one main with two cocktails n coffee.
"Great managerial service , good bagel",Nice bagel. Great attentiveness from manager to help with my takeaway bagel request. As the restaurant does not offer takeaway I made a reservation two days prior on his suggestion so that the process can be smooth and the table is quickly available for the next diners. He took service to a higher level by giving it on the house as a thank you for my patronage. He is speaks knowledgeably about world bank food donation partnership and is kind and courteous. He could probably run his own restaurant with good success.
"Bread Stree Kitchen, Singapore",An unforgettable dining experience with excellent service and delicious food. Not forgetting the amazing setting!! 😋😋😋
Great food !! Excellent service !!,"Was craving for bread basket. Thus we went to Bread Street. No reservation was made and we got right lucky to get 2 seats at the long dining table.

Excellent service by Sid, knowing we came in hungry bread basket was served in short time. Cocktail was good and food was delicious. Ordered prawn cocktail, crispy duck salad and a Sirloin steak for sharing. End the dinner with sticky toffee sooo good soo yummy.

We left happy and satisfied!! Yummy"
Living up to the name ! Superb beef Wellington!,Living up to the name! Superb beef Wellington! Friendly and attentive serviced staff. End with a nice warm birthday cake for my boyfriend ! Will return soon!!
Amazing service and food,"Amazing service. Friendly staff. Great ambience. Good food. Love their bread, burger, salad and wine! Definitely be back again though I’m literally there at least once a month. Haha!"
Loving the food.,Love the whole experience of except for a minor service lapse. Otherwise I love the Beef Wellington which is the restaurant signature.
Good dining experience,Good was great and service was superb. Thank you for the wonderful dining experience. We will definitely come back again
Awesome!!,Fantastic service & best meal we’ve had in Singapore in 7 years of being here! Beef Wellington was insane!! Definitely recommend & will definitely return
Good choice for gathering with family and friends,"Good food, friendly staff, nice ambiance, easy for families with kids or large groups in main dining room, good pick for celebrations and gathering."
"Fantastic, highly recommended","What a great meal, the burger was excellent, and the chocolate soufflé was outstanding, but what was even better was the service and a special shout out to Sonia made mines and my night great with great recommendations."
Mr,"Nice dining environment , good foods and solid services from the staffs. Prevent disappointed, you must booked the table in advance before you head down and dine."
Absolutely horrible,"After 3 visits to Singapore we finally decided to try out this place which has so many good reviews and given that it’s run by Gordon we felt safe to try it out. I am hugely disappointed in every single dish we ordered. It was absolute garbage.
Butter chicken wasn’t even close, fish and chips was a huge let down and the list goes on.
Next time Gordon swears at anyone for making bad food he should look himself in the mirror. I have never written such a bad review ever."
Family Sunday lunch,"Great food, good service and reasonable price. Sunday roast was exceptional with a lot of beef well cooked and excellent vegetables."
Sorry we went,"Service was good; location is a mall (albeit a fancy one), so mixed; prices were on the high side; food was a big disappointment. We ordered the Beef Wellington. It looked great but the bread/veg wrap had a bitter, acrid taste. Fish & chips were “okay” but should have been “outstanding” at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. If this were Joe Blow’s, I’d give it three stars."
Bread Street Kitchen & Bar Singapore,"My mother surprised me for my birthday and took me to this establishment for an 8pm dinner reservation. We were seated on the first level and were able to see the Fullerton Hotel and the Apple store from our table, which made for lovely photographs! For mains, I ordered the Steamed Red Snapper and my mother ordered the Roasted Cod. The snapper was absolutely divine; falling apart right as I sliced into it, and the cherry tomatoes and greens all added some oomph to the dish. For dessert, my mother and I both ordered the Pineapple and Kiwi Carpaccio with Coconut Sorbet, which was refreshing and delicious! And, for my birthday, I was surprised by the staff with a complimentary slice of chocolate cake which was so light and tasty. Staff were friendly and enthusiastic, and made sure we had everything we wanted."
Birthday Celebration,"Was there with my friend.. we each ordered a steak with red wine. The staff is v nice when I asked for recommendation of the wine as it was too hard to make a choice off the list. And the steak is juicy and soft for someone like me with braces :)

Price wise was ok for 2 pax and the quantity might look little but we were so full that we did not manage to finish what was on our plate.

Will definitely go back there again, maybe to try other food on the menu."
BreadStreet Kitchen,"Bread street restaurant offer a variety of choices from alcoholic drinks to non alcoholic beverages that will sure quench that thirsty hearts of yours.
Paired with a sumptuous main dishes which you will surely love down to its flavorful and satisfying desserts.
Its a must to put on your list to visit this BreadStreet Restaurant."
Step up your game Ramsey…,"When was the last time Gordon Ramsey quality checked this place?! Butter Chicken taste about the same as the stuff my wife makes out of a jar, which is pretty tasty to be fair (note: best butter chicken is Oh Calcutta restaurant in Parnell, New Zealand, epic!) and the rice it was served with was sickly sweet. Blah, yuck! My Son had the burger which was good but not knock your socks off good.

This place isn’t bad and the restaurant is pretty cool but expected way more from the food behind the man from Hells Kitchen. Poor form buddy."
Good Beef Wellington,"Juicy and crispy outer layer. overall very nice. Good ambiance. advisable reserve table before that, otherwise can queue and wait for table which take longer time"
Very good taste e great quality,"Superlative offer of good and traditional food, great classic like beef Wellington e macaroni cheese. Service was delight."
Absolute horrendous wait time,"Was seated at 730pm, ordered at 735pm for a beef welly and steamed snapper. 830pm and still no sign of any food. Absolutely low standards here. When it was finally served, dough crust of the welly was raw."
Lunch at the Bay,"Service was excellent despite the crowds! All staff had very positive attitudes and know their products, well. Please keep it up!"
Walk in lunch,"Great lunch experience with tasty food and service !
The prices were reasonable with a very attentive waiter who was knowledgeable of the food and gave excellent. recommendations. Two fish bones were found in the fish and chips and brought to the attention of the waiter !
He apologized for the oversight but as the dish was already eaten, he could not replace it with a fresh replacement
However we were pleasantly surprised when we came to settle the bill and was told that the deserts were complimentary in lieu of the bones in the fish and chips dish !
We shall certainly visit the restaurant again"
"Good good, crap service","Wonderful food, very poor service, or even interest in their customers, but can't fault the food! Strange thatctheybturned away customers at 930 pm, stating the restaurant was fully booked. Seemed to be a lot of empty tables?"
Nice ambience and food,"It was nice dining experience with great food. The beef wellington was good, juicy and tender meat with crispy pastry on the outside"
Average,"Third visit, the fish and chips were just so-so, my second visit also ordered the same dish and it was very much better. This time the fish was not that fresh, I was struggling to finish towards the end, not because of the quantity but the quality. Probably due to inconsistent quality, anyway unlikely to order this dish here again. Still searching for the place with good fish and chips.
Normal customer service."
First visit to BSK Singapore,"Ordered the Wellington Beef. Pastry cooked to perfection, beef was juicy, tender and cuts through like jello. Side salad was dressed just right not too sharp. Preparation was long over 45 mins so we had Ceasar salad to keep us busy. Ordered the so called larger portion but still looked a little small. Felt the aged parmesan would have been better served raw rather than fried to crisp."
Lunch at Gordon Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen 😎,"So I was looking for lunch at Marina Bay Sands earlier this week. I went to Gordon Ramsay Bread Street Kitchen which I wanted to try for a long time.
They have their simple menu outside so you know how expensive you will be paying. No reservation but we got a high table close to the kitchen. Took a look around after ordering our food .
The $4 set of bread was nice.
Had a nice chicken wings for appetiser.
Our main course was one with cod
Another was with the red snapper. Overall, the food was nice but you shouldn't worry about the price if you come here"
Team Dinner,"Amazing food, great customer service. Good Ambience!! Happy and enjoyable time with time with the team"
Average Pub Food,"Good service
I had the crispy duck to start ,if was bordering on chewy as was my husband calamari
The mains where spoiled by being only luke warm especially the side dishes ,they where almost cold
The restaurant had many empty tables but they made people cue outside
Is this a Singapore thing,why make people wait"
Superb comfort food!,We ordered a Sunday Roast and a Fish and Chips. I am glad that the fish and chips come with malt vinegar and the roast is so tender. The staff is also attentive to us. It was our first visit but we will sure come again!
"Food quality, Great Service","Delicious and good quality food. Hope the lamp chops can return to the menu; miss this very much. The fish and chips still the best in Singapore that is closest to the London version. The new slow-cooked roasted pork belly is delicious, crispy skin, very juicy, tender, well-balanced layers of fat vs lean pork. Need to make prior reservation and hard to get seats even via early reservation."
Bread Street Kitchen,Amazing service and food was well worth it. Could not fault our waiter. Would definitely come back next time in Singapore.
Excellent Service!!,Amazing experience!! Food's great! Everything is great.!! The waiter Minne from South Korea is super amazing! Best waiter MUST go to her !!!!
Great Food and excellent service,"Great Food and deserts . Love the fish and chips . And great service staff, always smiling and attentive."
Awesome experience,This is my first time here but definitely not the last. The food are amazing and the crew here makes the dine in experience even amazing. Will definitely recommend anyone who wants to give this a try. 👍🏻
Great food at Bread street kitchen,Food was delicious. Kids friendly restaurant & kids food are delicious too with reasonable price. Satisfied & worth meal.
Good service & Great food,Very attentive server and knows the menu well. The quality of food was good!! Just hope they have a little more variety in near future.
"Excellent food, service and ambience","I brought a close friend vising from Japan to Bread Street Kitchen at MBS. The food was excellent as usual. Service was prompt and very well mannered. Definitely a ""must go"" place!"
"Bread Street Kitchen, Singapore","Good taste of food, located in The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. I’ve tried Bread Street Kitchen burger and Beef Wellington… 👍👍"
Burger,"The patty is juicy and the bun is glazy and soft. The fish and chips is decent. Overall, its a good experience."
MIND BLOWING,"I really thought Gordon Ramsay was just all hype, but when I tried his signature Beef Wellington, it really blew my mind. The rainbow of flavors were just exquisite.

Though I'd have to say, it was more like a good for 4 than a good for 2."
Amazing service,Last night had an incredible dinner. Talila was great and really friendly. Truly excellent service !
Dinner,Good food! Limited variety though. Visited on sat night. Waited more than an hour for a table. Ended with bar seats. Exp prob would even be better if we had a table seating. Will be back.
Review,A great dinning experience over good food and ambience with my family. Every dishes that we ordered is an awe ! The staff are efficient. Will definitely patronize again.
Birthday celebration,"First visit for my son's birthday. Food was good. The non-alcoholic beverages on the menu was good too though I wish there were more varieties. Bonus point was that they have a cake for those celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, etc."
Worth waiting for a table,Waited for a table on a Thursday night - which I didn’t expect but the service and food was worth waiting for. I enjoyed the Butter Curry - portion size was spot on - and a delicious glass wine.
Strongly recommend to have a great meal in the MBS,"Highly professional and careful services
All the food we had was amazing. We had dry-aged sirloin stake, pork belly and superfood salad. One thing bothered me was only the low temperature due to the air conditioning."
National Day Family Dinner,"Food was spectacular. Portion was value for money. Great food Great taste, very delicious. Beef was tender, very well cooked, love the famous fish n chips, fresh !"
Celebration dinner,"I made a reservation 2 weeks prior to my visit, and I did not need to wait long to be seated. The food is great, and so were the drinks. We certainly enjoyed ourselves."
Good dining experience,"Good service and meals. Sticky Toffee Pudding was the highlight of our lunch. My friend who is there for the first time, was deeply impressed, and vowed to return again soon."
Birthday Celebration,"Great service, good beef wellington. The cocktails is wonderful too. And I love that they provide a birthday cake which is sweet and appreciated."
Birthday Celebration,Best place to have beef wellington and cocktails. We rely enjoyed our dining experience there and are likely to visit again.
Dinner,"Bussin tuna tartare, bussin mac & cheese, bussin apple cider, bussin BSK Burger, bussin slow roasted pork belly!!!"
