Not good,Sushi chef was very rude and food was overpriced. There are way better places for sushi in Singapore.
Reasonably Priced Omakase,We had the $198 Omakase which was 7 course. 6 of the courses were good but the seafood hot dish was a disappointment. 1 prawn and 2 small pieces of scallop. We already had scallop in the sashimi course so was expecting something different. What was odd was the other cooked dish which they brought out lamb We were expecting A4 Wagyu after seeing this in Sethlui’s YouTube. We asked that they change the dish which they promptly did so to Spanish Mackerel without any questions. Side note: they had asked us at the start if there were any dietary restrictions and we said no squid but we didn’t expect Lamb to be served in a Japanese Omakase meal.
Best omakase in Singapore with good customer service!,This is the 2nd time we ate at Sushi Jin and it was great!! We had the Chef Omakase + Ala carte Chawamushi and Salmon Ikura don. The quality of fresh seafood is excellent!! We would like to compliment Phillip for his excellent customer service and attention to detail. Would recommend this place to family and friends. Thank you Sushi Jin!
"The food here s great, the service is poor. All over very expensive.","The food here s great, the service is poor. All over very expensive.
They had high end quality fish and ingredients, the composition was flawless and inspired.
The service didn’t understand any concepts of working in such a place with high end prices. They interrupted conversations without need, they kept listening in on conversations the guests had. They took away the dish of one person while the other person was still eating, they took away half full sake glasses…"
Great food and impressive service,"Thanks to Mr. Philip Chin, my wife and I had an amazing omakase culinary experience. Amazing service and detailed explanation of the courses served to table. Looking forward to the next visit."
Good and Value for money Omakase,Definitely worth a visit! Great service and value for money omkase. Had the 12 course sushi omakase and their special (seared scallop with foie gras) was to die for!

Good Service from Mr Phillip,He was a very good server to us from the start to the end of our birthday lunch. Even gave us a complimentary cake. Will be back for the good food!
Bday lunch for a friend,The omakase lunch was mediocre for $118 per pax. We were left half hungry. They wanted to serve dessert before serving our last course. Nothing spectacular and was vastly disappointed as it’s under Les Amis group which I frequent regularly except this outlet.
Genuine amazing food with attentive and helpful staff,"We went looking for a genuine Japanese cuisine place, and we found it! Lovely staff, very helpful and attentive. Amazing food!!! We shared a few appetizers and then went on to sushi, accompanied by Japanese white wine and sake. Would absolutely come again!"
Excellent modern Japanese cuisine,"The food here is always fantastic - great traditional flavours that you expect from Japanese cuisine with modern twists and surprises along the way. The dishes are all presented beautifully, and the quality of ingredients shines through.

Their service is excellent and accomodating, and they explain every dish so you're never left wondering.

An absolute treat to visit!"
Amazing experience,Staff were very friendly during the meal and assisted with any query or request. Food was fantastic with affordable pricing. A great experience and will definitely return again. Highly recommend!
Wonderful restaurant amazing food,"It is my first time in Sushi Jin. I read that they are part of Les Amis Group that I've many of their restaurants and love the quality of their food, service and ambience. This restaurant is just as amazing. Ambience, food and service is excellent"
Japanese gem in Little India,"Seafood is their forte. Leave to the chef’s discretion, be pleasantly surprised by the season’s offerings."
Memorable first visit!,It only took us 8 years until we finally found this lovely restaurant. We thoroughly enjoyed the chef’s omakase meal especially the delicious sushi prepared by Chef Patrick Tan. The warm and professional service we received from Mr Philip Chin elevated our experience beyond a great dinner. We’ll definitely be back!
"Delightful, fresh, ambiance","Everything about this experience was perfect. The ambiance, the drinks, the freshness of the fish. I love the open counters in which we see the chefs hard at work preparing our rolls with the premium ingredients. The ootoro was out of this world, how it melts in your mouth. Philip also came out and gave us a run down of our drinks, which I thought was extra delightful. I’m excited to make this place that we regularly visit, and I can’t wait for the Omakase again! Oh and the desserts! The matcha cheesecake and the Yuzu Mochi was such a delight to wash the delicious food down."
Authentic Japanese Food,"We ordered 2 special omakase at $118 each. The other is sushi omakase is $138. I prefer a mixture of food with sushi so I ordered $118.

The food is fresh, taste is perfect!

I will come back for the raw food and sake. The sake is recommended by Philip. A perfect for my palate!

You should try too!"
Memorable birthday lunch!,"Great service, and delicately plated omakase. Had a lovely handwritten card and complimentary slice of cake. My boss and hubby enjoyed the ambience and food very much. Thank you!"
Enjoyable Dinner,"The food quality was excellent. The restaurant was clean and cozy. We were served by a thoughtful gentleman, Mr Philip Chin. He offered warm water when he observed that I had a bit of cough. The restaurant prepared a slice of cake for my spouse’s birthday. Highly recommended for family and celebration."
Great food and fabulous services,"If you are looking for good Japanese food - fresh sashimi, very good sushi fresh cooked food, you will find it at a reasonable price in Sushi Jin"
Casual lunch,"Excellent Kaisen Don Peaceful ambient Excellent Sashimi fresh juicy tasty, atop sushi rice with sprinkle of garlic — out of this world Dining utensils also pleasant to see Kind gentle service is another plus point"
Fantastic Omakase experience,"Every dish was better than the last. The uni sushi, tuna belly nigiri, crab kani miso topped with the sea urchin, baby prawns, Hokkaido scallop… there wasn’t a single dish that was not spectacular. Must visit"
Excellent food and good service,"Food quality is super good, staff are very friendly and well trained. Although the restaurant is a bit small, however it makes me feel like homely. Definitely will come more often."
Great service,"Great service by the supervisor Philip, he is very attending, passionate and warm. Lunch was very enjoyable.

Food was great, even tho there are better place for chirachi don.

The staff (youngest Chinese guy)who attends the door was terrible, he walks around kicking his shoes, very loud!"
My comfort japanese omakase,Service - always top notched Food - well prepared and fresh Chef is also friendly and engaging. Service staff is so attentive to your moves.
Fresh sashimi and Friendly staff,"Very nice environment, friendly staff and most importantly very fresh sashimi ! Will visit again the next round"
Great Omakase dinner,"While not the best, but great food and great service from the Supervisor, Philip. He was attentive and patient with the explanation of the dishes and how we should consume it Omakase (Jin). While the ingredients are fresh, however, the repetitive of Uni and Truffle item made it felt like the chef ran out of idea on what else could be included on the menu. Nonetheless, still great food, especially the Foie Gras sauce on some of the items."
Delicious and value for money truffle chawanmushi !,"Went to sushijin for lunch, had the unagi jyu lunch set, along with truffle chawanmushi.
The truffle chawanmushi came with a slice of truffle on top with caviar, prawn, scallop, and bits of thinly shredded crab meat. Absolutely delicious !

Mr Phillip chin, one of the restaurant's staff was perfectly attentive , and gave splendid service and even gave me complimentary tea!

Will definitely go back again !"
Almost the best sushi restaurant yet.,"If I remember correctly this was my 4th time dine in to this restaurant & it’s standard never disappoints. The food is really fantastic, the venue’s classic but professional. Definitely worth dining in, but the only drawback is the customer service. If the restaurant is very busy I understand if the waiter/waitress did not engage the customers but if it’s not they can at least not extreme, communicate with them, like getting feedbacks about the food or just a simple topic. Well that’s all i have to say. I’ll rate this restaurant a 4/5. Almost to perfection."
Sushi Jin - Fantastic services and kind and attentive waitresses and manager,"Food is good and steady. Services is tip top as they focus on attending to the tinest discomfort and request. Top up water very quickly and ask frequently if we are ok with the food and if we need to add on some other food. And very attentive to timing of food delivery and our special request for serving the foods, vegetarian request and timing request. Payment is swift and fast, no delaying. Good place to have meeting with your customers and friends and they give you space once a meeting starts."
Excellent customer service and food!,"My friend and I were getting late for our reservation but they were really understanding about it. We both liked the atmosphere and since it was our first Omakase experience it was really good! And when we were about to pay, I mentioned that it was my friend’s birthday so they were so nice to have given us a surprise at the end by giving a complimentary cake with a candle! Really sweet! I’d definitely go to Sushi Jin again!"
Great experience!,"I will definitely visit again. I would suggest to take special omakase menu because the amount of food they serve is really a lot especially urchin and caviar.

One thing to note is the omakase menu is more flavourful than others because they used a lot of sauces.

Nevertheless, We were really full and happy the meal. The chef and staff there are all very nice people to chat with. Great ambient, yummy food and friendly people. Will definitely visit again."
"Pretty interesting, but missing some oomph","Overall a decent omakase meal though it seems they were trying to finish up the Uni, cavier??

Personally, as much as I like Uni, cavier etc... if over used, just makes the whole meal taste too heavy. The ingredients are fresh no doubt, but maybe the chef could try to work a bit more on balancing the whole course with more variety of ingredients?"
Omakase,"Good food not matter omakase or ale cart,nice staff,clean,good atmosphere.near to farrer park mrt.will visit again."
Excellent food and service,Food is good and quite a fair price. Servers are friendly. Place is clean and tidy. Recommended to come.
Best omakase,"All fresh,beautiful and taste sooo goodddd 😍😍 keep on coming there coz food fantastic, friendly service,best"
Unforgettably Good Food,"Food was really fresh and good. The seared wagyu beef platter was unforgettable. So was the Hokkaido set's scallop....sweet and fresh. Ottoro set was awesome. Overall, the food was excellent. Although price point was a bit steep. It's good for special occasion but not regular meal."
Great offerings,Superb service staff. Attentive and helpful. Lovely omakase offerings at Sushi Jin. Will definitely be back soon.
Great expereince,"I can certainly recommend the Sushi Omakase. The restaurant also offers a good selection of Sake. The staff were very friendly and hospitable, which helped to make it an enjoyable experience."
Dinner at Sushi Jin,"planned a surprise for the boyf here hence wanted to discretely pay off the bill. decided to drop off my card with one of the staff on my way out to the washroom, and he literally waited for me at the entrance just so he could pass me back my card so the boyf wouldnt realise, thank you!!!"
Good food and service,"Food was delicious and elegantly presented. Chef and staff were friendly, attentive and helpful. Highly recommended"
Not only sushi!,"A great experience in this tiny place where we've enjoyed sushi - of course, but also maki and tempura from a very well furnished menu of Japanese delicacies. The nice staff adds to the quality of this place."
Go for Omakase,We booked very last minute and was informed that they’re fully booked. I asked the lady if they can put us on waitlist. called again and finally we got a table. Omakase is a great choice.
Great food. Great service. Very good experience.,Had a business lunch with two colleagues. All of us enjoyed the meals and we also enjoyed the sake very well. Excellent service from the service staff. Recommended.
Food is good but service can be improved,"Had the Omakase lunch set. Food is good with great value. Service is poor though, even with 3 serving staff and the small restaurant was not crowded. Thankfully the chef stepped in to help with serving when he realised the service staff was not quick enough."
Chef Special Omakase,Every item was done in manner so artistic and eating it was a wonder in itself. This was a long awaited trip since some two years ago when we were last here. Really enjoyed ourselves and hope to come back for more!
Good food but terrible dining experience!,"Was there for a late lunch @1.30pm. Had the lunch Omakase but felt we were rushed thru the lunch; dishes were served barely before we finish the existing dish. Bill was presented at 230pm as the cashier was closing. Our 5 course was done in a jiffy of 40mins (including a cooked fish cheek dish). Food was good but the experience was terrible; If I really wanted fast food, I would have visited sushi express!"
Reasonable set lunch,Nice restaurant nearby that offers reasonably priced but good quality set lunch. Would definitely come back again.
Value for money,"Omakase restaurants can be so ridiculously priced these days and we knew this was part of the Les amis group, but it is a quiet spot so we decided to try it out. The decor is basic and not that high end, lots of service staff chatter in Mandarin on a quiet weekday evening reinforced that perception. We both ordered the the Omakase jyo Sen for $130 thinking we may be hungry. We were pleasantly surprised, the food was good, especially the six pieces of sushi, which had foie gras, scallop, chutoro and others, all well prepared, the clam soup was hot and had ample ingredients. Good choices for appetiser. The cooked item of a tuna steak was tender and really nice. The dessert of mochi plus ice cream was also excellent. Maybe the sashimi was pretty standard but it was well prepared. The service was a little rushed at time but I was dining with my wife, so we were not expecting a long slow dinner. Overall, I thought it was excellent value, will try the lunch option one day. Not a place to wow the VIPs but great for everyday dining."
Yummy lunch,Yummy lunch: food quality and service is top notch! Totally on par with other restaurants like Ki-Sho and Shinji.
Wonderful Experience,"We had a blast at Sushi Jin having their Tokusen Omakase. Everything was fresh and delicious, don’t miss this if you’re a big fan of uni, caviar, foie gras, scallop, and the freshest fishes! Not to say the service is top notch and chefs are extremely professional and friendly. Would definitely go back!"
Don’t go,First time here. From the setup and deco. Was expecting a decent high Japanese restaurant. Mix sashimi is a big disappointment with low grade toro and uni. Teppanyaki Wagyu beef is believed to be just normal beef. Soft shell crab roll comes full of very used oil smell and tastes. Service is average and price is high end. Will not go again.
Good value for lunch Omakase,Went to Sushi Jin for their lunch Omakase at $80 per pax and found it to be reasonably good value. The starters were nice and all the sushi and sashimi served were very fresh. We were also seated at the Chef table and were able to watch them prepare the food which was quite enjoyable to me. Dinner is a bit more expensive and I will probably be more inclined to go for their lunch menus.
Dinner,"Had 2 share of sea urchin and their truffle seafood chawamushi ❤️
I’m totally impressed by the dessert. The mochi was so chewy and delicious
I’m definitely will be back again during November as they mentioned the sashimi will be better during that period of time"
Not up to par,Used to like this place but quality has deteriorated significantly since I was last here. Not a good value versus the other lunch omakases there are out there given the types of fish / dishes served. The multi course meal comprised of a limited selection of 5-6 types of fish which were repeated between the sashimi and sushi courses. Fish offering fell in the low quality spectrum and some of the nigiri had weird fusion sauces put on them. Maybe just not our thing!
Not too bad,"I was here before for their Omakase lunch and it left an impression. So, together with my baby, I decided to bring my husband here for dinner to celebrate his birthday. We ordered the Omakase and a bottle of sparkling pear sake. Everything started well - great appetisers, sashimi platter - and then it tripped for a good whole 30mins when no food could be served. At first, the staff were very sure that the lights would come back up in 10mins but it was an endless wait. at one point in time it got stuffy and the staff were so apologetic that they gave us the option of leaving the restaurant and the cost of our meal would be waived.

Just when we were about to leave, the lights came back and we decided to complete the course of our Omakase set.

Overall, because of the trip, the experience wasn’t perfect. Partly also because I didn’t feel like my meal was explained to me in a very detailed manner, like an Omakase meal should be.

Would probably come back again but during lunch time as it is more affordable."
great food at a fare but not great price,food was great but it seemed rushed and not personalized at all... we got lunch omakase and nothing about it seemed that special...
Would expect much better service for the price range! But food was excellent.,"We were the first customers to arrive and it was before noon. We asked if the restaurant was opened. The service staff, without a smile or any welcoming gesture, replied yes with a straight face. Throughout the meal, no service staff smiled at us at all. No offer of introduction of the menu or promotion. It’s like we were served by robots. I would expect at least some smiles from the staff for the price range the restaurant was charging. My friend from France even commented ‘The staff are obviously Singaporean.’ Not a nice reflection of Singaporean service, isn’t it? Fortunately, the food was really good in taste and quality. We enjoyed every dish from starter to dessert. So it wasn’t a wasted trip after all. Hope the restaurant can look into better service training for the staff."
Japanese dishes for a change,"We have been in the mood for a change of food, Japanese instead of Chinese to be precise, so we went to Sushi Jin which was within walking distance from the place we stayed. It has been the right choice; tasty dishes very nice presented by a friendly staff made our dining out day."
Chope Didn’t Work,Went to the restaurant and was told there were no records whatsoever of my reservations. Fortunately there were counter seats available.
Cosy and good food,"The restaurent is on the ground floor, indirectly opposite 7 Eleven. We ordered a range of lunch sets to try. Service is good. The food was served very quickly and we enjoyed the meal. The seafood on each sushi was a generous portion. Each set comes with soup, salad and dessert. The table seating is rather limited. Book in advance to prevent disappointment."
Lunch Omakase 👍🏻,"Made a reservation for the Lunch Omakase and left satisfied and absolutely contented. I’ve always loved the quality of Sushi Jin’s food (and am an absolute sucker for anything Aburi from here), but have only tried their regular Omakase ($130 and $180) prior to this because I rarely get to sit down for Omakase during lunchtime.

My colleague and I absolutely loved the Lunch Omakase! At $80++ per pax, this was a real steal for the impeccable amount and quality of the food we got. Highlights from the meal include the sashimi selection and the Bara Chirashi Don, which came with huge quantities of chopped sashimi, roe and melt-in-your-mouth uni. Finish off with a refreshing grape sorbet to cleanse your palate. All in all a very gratifying lunch - will definitely come back!"
Wouldn’t return,Noisy kids playing video games at the counter Food was average. Become localised w strong sauces and putting truffle tapioca in many dishes. Disappointing
Superb set lunch at super reasonable prices,Not too many tables - so make sure you make your reservations - i will certainly be back sooner than later and more often than not!
Fantastic Sashimi!,"Location is kind of hidden in the basement of Ferrer Park Hotel, but I am super glad to find this hidden gem.

Visited the restaurant twice. Once for lunch and the other for dinner. They have slight different menu between lunch/dinner but both are fantastic.

Tried the omakase for dinner. Delicious, full of surprises and very fulfilling. Chef really showed his culinary artistry in the dishes.

However, for someone with little stomach like me the omakase is almost too much. If you just want to enjoy the cream of the crop, order and savor the super fresh and exceptional sashimi. I enjoyed piece by piece with explosion of taste and excitement.

This place really raised my personal standard of quality sushi"
Our all-time fave!,"Sushi Jin never fails to impress. This is my go-to place for anything Aburi, and they also do a neat Premium Wagyu Don (complete with foie gras and truffle) that has definitely become a fan-favorite. Choose the Omasake ($130 or $180) if you have difficulty deciding what to order. Head Chef Patrick Tan and his team are more than happy to cater to your requests and serve up the freshest and most umami dishes they have that day :)"
Nice sushi,I went there for my weekday lunch and had a sushi set ($45++). Value for money if you visit for your lunch on weekdays.
Good value for lunch,"Had the truffle wagyu donburi and the Hokkaido Don, really good value for lunch, premium ingredients at a wallet friendly price. Will be back."
"Excellent Sushi, Friendly Service and Value for money","Ordered 2x Sushi Lunch sets - started out with salad, followed by 10 sushi and lastly a plate of desserts. Chefs were very friendly and helpful. Will visit again."
Good Value Omakase Lunch,Another enjoyable lunch at Sushi Jin. Had the $80 Lunch Omakase and enjoyed every dish served. Generous portion and good quality.
Birthday Celebration,Had my birthday celebration with my husband over there . Food n service are good. Food is fresh. Will definitely be there again.
Must try their Omakase!,"Highly recommended their Omakase, $180 or $130. Ask for counter seat. Must make reservations. Cosy restaurant, just sit back and enjoy the meal! The best in Town!"
Nice lunch Omakase,"Please try the lunch omakase, it was nice, a bit expensive but worthy. Dinner is excellent. But make sure you sit in the counter, it is a much better place."
A great discovery for me,Very pleasantly surprised with the quality of food and service. Sushi set was both generous and of very good taste and presumably quality. Parking is very convenient with probably the widest carpark spaces in Singapore.
Excellent Lunch,Had the Omakase at Lunch and every dish was well executed by Desmond. We had wanted to order an extra dish and he ensured us that we will be very full by the end of the meal. Glad we didn't ! We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and will be back. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the place was too warm when I was there at 12.15pm. it only got slightly cooler when we were almost done with our meal
Love to be back,Always glad to come back for the wagyu Foiegrass meal. The sushi and fish are also very good. The complimentary mini desserts are also enjoyable.
Great quality Japanese sashimi and carpaccio.,Tai carpaccio was really good and fragrant with the black truffles. Sashimi were fresh and the wagyu teppanyakki was nicely done and not overcooked. Servers were attentive and prompt. We had a great and pleasant dinner. Also chef prepared a complimentary dessert for my son's birthday celebration. Nice gesture from the restaurant. Overall great quality of food.
First time visit,"Is one of the best sushi restaurant I've been to, sashimi was fresh, sake was awesome, quiet place and great ambiance for couple."
Good Authentic Japanese quality!,Having set lunch Sushi set ($45) and Wagyu Foie Grass Rice set ($45). Authentic taste. Fast service. Fresh quality of ingredients.
Good Omasake,My son love to eat at this Japanese restuarant for his birthday lunch. He selected the $180 omasake and it is very nice.
"Amazing service, sushi and sake!","I searched reviews for a while before settling on Sushi Jin, and I often rely on reviews when choosing a restaurant, so I hope this helps someone else! I took my husband here for his birthday, and we were blown away by the quality of the food and kind service. For us, this is a special occasion kind of place because of the prices, but you really do get what you pay for. Treat yourself and make a reservation!

I look forward to celebrating our next special occasion with a good meal and sake at Sushi Jin."
Fine Japanese Dining,This has become a fave place for a real treatThe fish is so fresh and succulent..best sashimi I have tastedThe food well presentedThe chawanmushi is out of this world....The staff are friendly and prompt in their serviceLimited seats though and must reserve early to avoid disappointment.
Try first hand at Sushi Jin,Went there to celebrate my wife's birthday. Booking was a breeze with the App. Restaurant called a day prior to remind. We did the Omakase and totally enjoyed it. The pace was just right and we enjoyed every one of the items. We liked their hot green tea as it had just the right touch of tea flavor and the wait staff were very attentive to refill. Chef Desmond Fong did a marvellous job that night demonstrating all his skills in food preparation. We were particularly impressed at how he blended in truffles with all the sashimi and sushi items.
I always come back here,"I am not sure about other menu. Whenever i come to Singapore, i always try to get its foiegrass wagyu don. This time taking my cousin, and she loves it a lot.
And they always serve us with good desserts in small sizes, so it is just right."
Very Delicious,"My 4th time come back, the must order is Premium waygu don which is not in the menu, definitely will come back again and again"
Below my expectations..,"After reading all the good reviews about Sushi jin, I was looking forward to try their omakase which sadly I wasn't impressed. My host ordered the lunch omakase set and apart from some truffle toppings and the cooked dish, the rest of the raw dishes didn't had the wow factor. The sashimi pieces were pretty chewy and the sushi platter variety were what I would get from a typical japanese restaurant. Only the ala carte beef yakiniku was tasty and good.

Overall the experience pleasant and quiet, but I wouldnt be back for the lunch omakase."
Very enjoyable Japanese meal in quaint neighbourhood,"Tucked away in a F&B alley of the Farrer Park Hotel in a quaint neighbourhood, this Japanese restaurant under the well-known Les Amis group, it is a quiet haven for a very enjoyable authentic Japanese meal. hi I"
Prefer foie gras wagyu don,This time trying something little different. Wagyu don with egg. Next time i will stick to foie gras Wagyu Don 😁.
Lovely spot for all occasions,Affordable Omakase sets featuring premium meats and fishes. Chefs skills are superb which translates to his dishes. His twist on the sushi creations are marvellous.
Wow. Just WOW!,"Given it's location between Farrer Park Hospital and Farrer Park Hotel and Spa, one wouldn't think you'd get quality Japanese food. Boy was I wrong! They have an omakase menu as well as lunch specials and off menu items. I went for the off menu ""Premium Wagyu Don"". Its got seared wagyu beef, foie gras, uni, caviar, shaved truffles, an onsen egg all on top of Japanese white rice! A tad pricey at 88 SGD, but in my opinion worth every penny!"
Amazing Japanese Omakase,"Sushi Jin is one of my favourite Japanese restaurants in Singapore for its amazing Omakase. Whilst they are not the cheapest, I think you get the quality and service for what you pay for. All dishes are freshly prepared by the Chef and offer a journey for your taste buds. The accompanying house sake is very nice and goes very well with the food. If you want to try some of their other dishes, Sushi Jin also has an a la carte menu. If you are looking for authentic Japanese Omakase I can only dearly recommend this restaurant."
A bit expensive for what you get,"The food here is nice enough, it's just a little pricey relative to the quality. For the same price at lunch you can eat at Aoki in Orchard versus eating inside a hospital building in Farrer Park. Service and attention to detail also aren't at the same level. The Izakaya next door seemed to offer similar fare at about half the price."
Delightful!,"Tried two lunch sets with my son: the yakiniku don (22SGD++) and the wagyu to foie gras don (45SGD++). Both were served by miso soup, salad and light dessert. Price and quality comparable to Shinzo's.
We had counter seats, and it was enjoyable to watch the itamae-san prepare sushi lovingly. Next time I will try the sushi as it looks as delectable as the ones offered in Shinzo and Tatsuya.
Service was decent, but can be warmer."
Treat for family,"Decide to bring the kids and sister for a good Japanese meals and I chose Sushi Jin while reading on the good reviews from previous patrons. Awesome, fresh and delicious sashimi and sushi. We had Omakase and kids having their favourite sushi and tempura dish. Staff were patient an attentive. Woo... loved the cold sake cup, very unique and you get to choose which one to use. Loved the dessert. Not a big place but good quiet environment. Loved the quietness as compared to normal noisy restaurant. We were seated at the counter. Remember to call for reservation. Price is reasonable for the freshness of food and personal attentive service by the staff. Definitely will be back on my next return trip to home. Japanese cuisine is a must in my every trip back."
Back after a long time,... still the best! We sat at the counter and let the head chef decide what to serve us. Every dish was better than the next with the chef explaining each ingredient and how they enhance the taste of each other. It was so good that I didn't remember to take pictures of all the dishes.
Awesome Omakase,"Came here for lunch with my son. We're kinda skeptical at first what should we eat. So we decided to treat ourselves with their famous Omakase menu.

My hats off to the Chef. Very friendly, very patient explaining to us on each of the dishes they served, and also the way he cut the sashimi.

When they served the bamboo shoot, I honestly very skeptical at first. I'm not a big fan of bamboo shoot. Fortunately the way they served the bamboo shoot is so special, until Becoming one of my favorite during this Omakase lunch.

Definitely will come back again!! Highly recommended!!"
Food was okay at best,I cant understand the mumbling of Singlish Japanese english accent that the host is speaking when i called the restaurant to make a reservation. The restaurant is a little nice restaurant inside a hospital building. I was surprised that it was deserted because all of my friends recommended this restaurant to me. The highlight of the dish that night was definitely the truffle carpaccio as i am really not a big fan of chirashis. To me all decent Japanese Restaurant tastes the same because theres no difference between raw seafood from restaurant A and B.
Fabulously delicious!,We love sushi and Sushi Jin delivers the most amazing food. Every maki roll we tried was subtly nuanced. Each ingredient melted into the next to provide a truly delightful taste sensation. The entire staff as well trained and unobtrusively anxious to please. Chef Patrick was a delight. We had a grand tome chatting with him. Try this fabulous restaurant! We can't wait to go back.
Omakase menu - excellent,"Slightly strange location for a great restaurant, but you get used to shopping malls in Singapore.

The ambience was quiet, the staff quietly going about their jobs but welcoming. The waiters knew their food, and it was excellent quality.

Strongly recommend their omakase menu, good value at 130.

Will definitely go back!"
Good Chirashi don,"Had walked past this place on Monday and decided that I would return to try - so 3 days later I was back for a quick lunch. We ordered 2 set lunches - Kaisen don & Bara Chirashi Don. The set comes with a nicely cold salad, miso soup with a generous helping of seaweed and a mini dessert cheese cake and fruits.
We both enjoyed our lunch and will return for more. Service was excellent and Patrick at the sushi counter was very friendly.
Location just above the Farrer Park Station and at street level in the Farrer Park Hotel & Spa and Farrer Park Hospital complex, parking was a breeze and very reasonable for a quick lunch break."
