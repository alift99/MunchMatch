First experience on Mt Faber Arbora,"The service staff were professional, able to meet the needs of diners without compromising on standards. Flexible and make sensible decisions."
Lunch at Arbora cafe,"This cafe is always amazing, very good value for money snd staff service is excellent! Best place to bring foreigners as they can get very good views of Singapore as well as enjoy the walks around here. I'm so glad that they hv stayed in business all these years esp after the Covid19 crisis that have made alot restaurants closed down.
Food is local delights and authentic.
For senior citizens (above 60yo) there's weekday lunch package that's so economical. A set is only $16++ , a choice of main course and coffee/soft drink."
Nice ambience and food,"Nice ambience, food. Attentive and helpful staff. Love their kids pasta, chempedak butter pudding and wild mushrooms salad."
Lunch @ Arbora with UK friends,Great service and set lunch option for local seniors. Would be good if this is extended to all seniors (60+) regardless of nationalities. Nice view of cable cars and part of Singapore.
Birthday celebration,"staff was very friendly and accommodating :) food was great and tastes fairly good, suitable for all ages (children-elderly)"
Having a dinner at Arbora,We enjoyed watching the sunset at the top of Mount Faber and it was a wonderful experience. After dinner you can walk around park for the night view of harbor front and the west part of Singapore.
Nice food nice environment,"The location is abit far, but the the ambient is nice, food worth the price and scenary. Jenny is my service attendant, very nice Service. Would recommend to my friend."
Excellent view of the Singapore skyline,"Situated on top of Mount Faber, this restaurant’s unique proposition is that it offers a great view of the Singapore skyline.

Was a bit concern about parking but this was unfounded as it offered a Valet service which is free is you dine at the restaurant.

Food was just above average but service was a bit lacking. We had a server trying to take our order without a pen and paper to take it down and had to call her colleague to take our order.

Food as served quickly.

Ambience was excellent and we all has a good time."
Overpriced NYE meal,"A very lazy restaurant that produced subpar food, I guess because they relied on the hilltop ""view"". My family came here for the Jolly Good Times NYE dinner. Indeed it was very easy to have some sort of outing with young kids (we have a 3 yo and an infant). But I feel strongly that just because we have young kids (and just because you have a good view), does not mean to you shouldn't have good food. Anyway, the meal was $108++ and I would've only paid maybe half that for what I experienced. To be fair, the staff were genuine in their efforts to five you a good time but even the big dessert spread and handful of items that were somewhat memorable (like the chili crab) could not make up for a disappointing experience.

Come here for the view and maybe a beer but wouldn't recommend getting anything else."
"Pleasant ambiance, family style","The staff (Andrea, Dikines and Jenny) were very helpful and friendly. They made our experience more pleasant and enjoyable. We did not wait long for our food and the food was good."
Dinner,Food was really yummy & a bonus that the environment & view were such a steal. Staff service was good & we had enjoyed the meal so much.
Too expensive for whatever it was,"For Xmas Dinner buffet, there was no mint sauce with the lamb roast, no proper gravy for the turkey (only some kind of pumpkin sauce thing), pasta vongole broth was overly salted while arabiatta was not seasoned enough. Angry wings weren't spicy whatsoever , and chili crab was mediocre."
Friday night dinner Singapore,We arrived late but were given seats promptly without a booking. I liked the healthy mains and had the grilled salmon. And a prawn salad. The beer was cold. My colleague had the healthy roast chicken & beer. Good view and great night out in Singapore pleasant weather.
Meal,"The food is superb and the staff here are friendly and helpful. The manager, Krishnan is very nice and the atmosphere is very romantic"
Excellent Service,We were very pleased with the service and food. The staff were very attentive and were always available to attend to us.
Dining at Arbora,"Server Daswini was very patience with me, as I need to explain the food to my friend. Presentation and food portion was good. The laksa lobster was super!!!"
"Great view, patience staff and awesome food","Business dinner we had, staff was patience in listening to us, making table arrangement and changes, food was great and service was good"
Great experience,"Wonderful ambience, good night view, great service. The service staffs were helpful and friendly. My colleagues were happy with this dinner."
Excellent services by Mr Dexter,"We enjoy our dining at Arbora, Mr Dexter was very helpful and friendly. He help us took pics and Video and was acvomodating n efficient in his work. Highly recommneded for his excellent services rendered."
Great Food,My son loves the lobster Crews were friendly Overlooking of SG bay is great Cars were clean and safe
Very good dining at the hilltop,"The food is great, we ordered fish and chips (huge serving good for 1-2) and Lobster Laksa (super delicious, fresh ingredients!). The staff are very kind and accommodating, Dexter was our waiter and he knows what to recommend to us, super kind person. The lovation is very nicely located at the hilltop with good views and fresh air. Overall very nice experience and will definitely visit again!!"
BIRTHDAY DINNER @ ARBORA,"Our family enjoyed the good food, also the excellent service and staff. Highly recommended restaurant!"
Arbora,"Ordered the Striploin steak, pineapple pork ribs, caesar salad as well as the truffle steak fries. Steak was bad that I couldn’t finish it, would rather eat at Astons and the pork ribs just tasted like ribs with ketchup… caesar salad was decent but the truffle steak fries was just super disappointing… fries came with melted cheese that was dry and barely covered half of the fries. Would also be nice if the waiter gave us a head ups that our main course came with fries as well so we wouldn’t get the truffle steak fries but something else. The cocktail that I ordered was super good tho but the vanilla milkshake was average.. mcdonald’s milkshake taste so much better."
Fantastic,We were celebrating my friend’s birthday. The food are affordable and yummy at the same time. The staff are top tier . We were eating about 3pm plus so wasnt crowded so all the things we needed they gave it right away without waiting for a long time. Just surprised it wasnt expensivene for that kind of area. We had fun. Btw this is our 2nd time eating here.
Lunch at Abora,"Very good ambience overlooking the Harbourfront area. Service staff were friendly and very prompt in attending to the guests.
The only comment is that the price for Special Promotion Lunch Menu for Seniors have gone up significantly by 33% from S$12 to S$16 and yet the portion has shrunk :("
Pleasant day,We had the burger which was mediocre. Staff were very friendly and personable. Views were pretty good towards Sentosa Wathed the Singapore Air Force training at low levels
Beautiful food - beautiful views,"Arbora restaurant is located in an amazing spot, with fantastic views of Singapore & Sentosa. The staff were delightful - helpful and friendly. Food great - Laksa was delicious."
Great place for a romantic or family meal.,"Great view, Great food. Feels great to be away from crowded places. Love the promo of Singapore Sling and the DIY Dessert."
Dinner At Arbora,Very good service. Waitresses were very polite and attentive. Good Choices of food. Very Nice ambience .
Good view but average food,Great view but food was very average. My medium rare steak was overcooked and tough. Nice to come once but probably not worth a return visit.
Great Service,"2nd time having breakfast there, food was still tasty, and the service from the staff, especially the lady who is a trainee, was exceptional."
HILLTOP CHILL OUT,"went on a Monday early afternoon for lunch with friends. quiet inside the aircon area. outdoor seating also not noisy. Food is good. Price also ""good"" (abit pricey). We do not mind as we enjoyed the ambience. Thereafter we have our cakes outdoor as the aircon area is closed at 3pm. Will go back again for the evening view."
Convenient place for lunch before cable car,"We had lunch here as part of the klook lunch + cable car combo. Great service, decent selection of food reasonably priced. Staff were attentive and helpful"
Overall experience is good.,"Food is nice and view is not bad. Would advise to visit at earlier time slot. We booked at 8pm, so it’s quite dark. Service is good. The portion for fries can be quite a lot for pax of two as we have ordered our own mains as well."
"Great ambience, activities for kids, great food","I think this restaurant has great potential to become a 5-star. First and foremost, their ambience is excellent, would prefer an area for air-conditioning though. Their food was excellent, except for steak doneness. There was also a long wait for the food and re-fire of my steak. Wait staff were nice and friendly but they seem to lack attentiveness. BTW their cocktails are AMAZING! The good part is there's a little slide area for the children to play at. However, they do have lots of space, perhaps if they expanded the kids play area slightly, maybe a ball pit or something, it would be perfect to hold the kids attention and parents can enjoy their meal!"
Will be back!,Nice place. Airy and spacious. Elevated view. Away from the madding crowd on a Friday night. Decent food. Reasonably priced. Most staff pleasant and professional. Will be back!
Great Experience,Food is good but pricy. Excellent ambience and great service from staffs. Great collaboration with the valet service. Advice to reach around 6-7pm to experience the nice view. Will definitely visit again.
Food & Service,"Food was not hot as all the dishes came out at the same time, portion was small.
Service was ok only."
Good restaurant,Food was pretty mediocre but for its location price $ was pretty ok. Went there to celebrate our anniversary and we ordered the Steak and Salmon for mains and the Crispy potato skin with chilli crab sauce as well as the truffle fries for sides. the potato skin with chilli crab sauce (side) as well as the salmon (main) were the better ones. View was really good especially if u are able to get the seats nearer the railings. 8.5/10 will visit again for the view.
Wonderful dinner,"The food is very nice and the service is wonderful. As my husband's fries is served cold, the waiter noted about the issue and replaced it with fresh ones immediately. In addition, the splendid view made our whole dining experience even better."
Good view and good dinning experience,"Good view, food and services. Will visit again. Nice place to chill out. Had a great time with family. Thank you."
Mixed feelings,"The salmon and pasta was ok, but the beef steak was rather tough. Views of Sentosa and south side was nice."
wonderful moment,"Great experience, nice environment, friendly staff, of course, the food was delicious too，will definitely go again"
Make reservations if you want the best seats,"I brought a friend to this restaurant for a weekday lunch recently. It looked like a popular place as half the tables were already taken even though we were there just before 12 pm. The best tables were the ones closest to the railings as they came with unimpeded views of the southern environs of Singapore, but these were reserved, so it probably pays to make reservations. We had a nice table set slightly back but do bring sunglasses as the restaurant can get quite glary during the day time, but must be prettty nice from dusk onwards.

The menu was a nice mix of Western and Asian styles - I chose a pan-fried barramundi which was very nicely prepared although it did take some time to arrive. But that just gave my friend and I more time to catch up with one another. For those intending to drive up to Mount Faber, there is parking on the ground floor if you're having a meal at any of the restaurants. Otherwise, the nearest car park is about 5 minutes walk away."
Arbora made it very special,"Arbora is simply amazing.

From the food affordability. To the service staff.

We were late for our reservation but they called and checked if we were on the way. When we arrived we were expecting not such a great table but we still got a table with a great view. This really impressed us. The views of the sunset already made our day.

Then we got to ordering. We were surprised at the prices of the food on the menu. For a place with such a great location and its proximity to Sentosa we found the prices affordable.

We recommend the Fisherman Stew and the Tiger Prawn Salad

We were there for a birthday and brought our own cake. The staff kept our cake in a chiller for us. When we requested for it, they brought it out for us and help us take photos of the special occasion.

We were probably the last to leave the place cause we were having a lovely time.

Will definitely return again.

P.S. I forgot to mention. The staff have great product and service knowledge. They informed us that they have discount rides of only $5 for the cable car. That's a big discount. We were having such a great time we completely forgot about the cable car rides."
Perfect dinner date,"Service was excellent , except for serving the lamb rack too early. Lamb rack was perfect but the tomahawk pork was not hot. 4.5/5 for food 5/5 for service 5/5 for ambience Perfect place for a date."
Arbora,"We were there for lunch, te ambience was nice and breezy. However we were disappojbted the chilli crab potato skin is not ready/ not available. The operation hours state 11am on weekdays but the kitchen only start at 12pm..do take note."
"Great view, Great Food",Been to Abora for few times. Never get disappointed. Great view fro. Hill top and food are great. Price are not too expensive given the view from hill top as bonus.
Feedback on service,"We patronised Arbora for dinner on 26th August. The service was very bad on that night as we encountered the following:

1) Carelessness - Service crew dropped their serving trays 3 times near our table
2) Carelessness - Pushing cart knocked against my chair 2 times when waiter maneuvered it towards the cashier
3) Inattentiveness - Refill of cold water was requested but waitress refilled the glass with warm water instead
4) Lack of coordination - 3 different service crew came one after another to ask if there was any last order"
Arbora date,The staff are approachable. The space 8n not crowded... a very quiet and nice place to dine in with your love ones
Great outdoor dining experience with a view :),"Came here to celebrate my fiancee's birthday and had a great experience. The drinks were great and I really enjoyed my smoked duck ragout. Unfortunately, my fiancee didn't fancy the laksa as much. But the staff were really nice and even offered to change the dish for her. They also gave us a small cake to celebrate her birthday and helped us take quite a few photos. The attitude of the staff, especially Tharindu (I hope I got the name right) is truly commendable, some of the best customer service I've seen in a while, and I am really very happy with my experience here (not forgetting the view of the Sunset was beautiful)"
Delicious food and great location,Good quality and delicious food. No crowded on weekdays so a great place to chill out. Service is excellent as well.
The view is amazing,"Its a very child friendly restaurant. Its an open concept but not hot and very airy. Food is alright on the pricey side. Average its about $25 and above for each dish.

Servicw was so so, staff was scattered and whenever we could find them, they were helpful, but had a hard time locating them"
Great view great food,"Overall, good dining experience. Food is good, service is good and atmosphere is good as well. No complaints."
Great evening celebrating wife birthday at Arbora,Food served was delicious. Staff were friendly helping us take some photos while dining. Environment was extremely beautiful.
Got best view,Food is tasty esp the juice. They impressed by giving birthday celebration candle. So love it. Got a best view
Wonderful experience at Arbora,"Made a reservation at this restaurant, not sure what to expect. When we reached the restaurant, was impressed by the service from most of the staff that we came across. The view was amazing! Food was good, but dessert was so so. Overall, love the ambience, place was quiet and we enjoyed the wonderful dinner, good job to the staff leaving us with a good memories!"
Service does not match the price,"I had a reservation and the booking system was easy to use. An automated call confirmed the reservation. On arrival we sat down and after a few minutes waiting for a menu were told we could scan the QR code on a phone to view it. However, we came with a prepaid set menu voucher so the standard menu was not applicable. After the special menu was given, I had to wave down the waitress to put in our order. The place was not busy i.e., 6 tables. Both our main dishes were out of stock which was disappointing due to the limited special menu.
Received our sodas and mine was flat and full of ice. After 20+ minutes of waiting, we had our appetizers and entrees brought out at the same time. Disappointing as we were hungry and the dishes should have been brought out at sequentially as would be expected of a professional restaurant.
Overall experience was okay given that we paid a reduced price for the special menu."
Nice view! Nice food!,Enjoy the good time with my husband for celebrating our anniversary at Arbora. Nice view and romantic environment. Food is delicious.
So nice and Highly recommended,"So nice and Highly recommended to all travellers who wants to go to Singapore .. Yummy foods,and good service .."
Fantastic Ambience and Food!,Went there on a weekday night and I must say the ambience is windy and fantastic with nice trending music being played through the speakers! The food portion was kinda big for one person and I must say the food is super good! Highly recommended for its Lobster Laksa and Chilli Crab Potato Skin!
Good food and views with excellent service,"Ordered the pastas, chilli crab potato skin, mushroom salad. mojitos were on 1-1 offer.
The food was delicious. Drinks wise, i did not taste the alcohol as much, but were refreshing.
Made a reservation and was given the choice to be seated either indoor/ outdoor.
We have chosen indoor as the weather was not good that day, but indoor ambience was good, and we were able to have the cable car view.
Staff service was good as well."
"Good food,good service",Abora is one of the best resto in sg. Foods are delicious plus x factor of the quality service of thier employees. Atmosphere is great... dine in at the top of the mountain is so relaxing.
Great view. Good service,"I booked a table for my son birthday celebration with special requests about the best cable view, however somehow the table was taken by walk in guests. Anyway I appreciated all the help from the staffs who managed to give us the table at the end. Staffs are attentive & helpful. Food are good. We will go back agin definitely"
Excellent service and the food was superlicious! Pls keep it going! The lobster laksa and fish and chips was awesome!,Excellent service and the food was superlicious! Pls keep it going! The lobster laksa and fish and chips was awesome!
Beautiful views,"The cafe is situated on Mount Faber and was part of the cable car ride. The Singapore slings were S$16 for 2. So, couldn’t resist . Great views of Sentosa from this cafe ."
One day tour,"Nice foods, good service, nice place. We all enjoy very much. Hope to have more event in future. Thank you"
Great dining experience at Arbora,"I have a wonderful experiences with the cable trip and lunch at Arbora, laksa was really good with a stunning view. We have a slight misunderstood about the lobster and the normal prawn and the management team did a great job to get things right and compliment us with addition desert as well, the head chef even come and greet us personally and we feel wonderful for our experiences here, strongly recommended for a visit!!"
Great view and environment,"View is great. Recall there was a toilet with great view there but not sure if it is still there as did not managed to find it.

Food is great and portion is big. Laksa gravy could use a little more flavour.

Staff is very friendly nevertheless. Thank you"
"Good food, great location, terrible service","We’d opted for the cable car combo. The servers were very rude and the tables were super sticky.
We ordered two courses which were served together. When asked to bring the main course later, they seemed offended and then later took forever to bring the course.

The food quality is very good. And the view is wonderful!"
5 star review but......,"Location, View and Anbience one of the best in Singapore. For me the food was 1 star, but maybe its just me as Im used to Indian, Thai, Indo, Malay, Mexican and other hot and spicy cuisines, So it was very bland for me. Perhaps Im not qualified for reviewing the food. I had the salmon and barramundi."
Birthday celebration,"We celebrated my friend birthday @Arbora last evening, as this is my favourite go to place. Arbora did not disappoint, it was the birthday girl first time and she had a great time! The food was well prepared, though menu selections were not wide selection, the rest the beautiful view made up for it. We would like to compliment the staff ""Daswini"" who made our time there especially pleasant and enjoyable. She was attentive to all of us and especially my elderly guests. Our compliments to her patience and took time to recommend the dishes and waited upon them. We were all taken by her warmth and professionalism. We will certainly return again!"
A gem up the hills,"Sitting Great high up on mt faber, this is a great breakfast place to act as a reward after a tiring morning hike with great staff to help feed and treat us well.

Its pleasing environment that makes you feel really relaxed and prepped up for a great day ahead!"
Great view,"The view from here was great. We ordered food with lobsters which were a little over-cooked. Other than this, the food was okay."
Good Food with a Beautiful View,"Had a good time with old friends on top of Mt Faber. Food was good and I especially like the beef don with ebi. We had a good deal being seniors. The bistro is, however, a little short-handed though."
Abora Service and Food,The young waitresses were nice enough to let us in 30 minutes earlier and briefed us politely that food would only be served at opening times. Service was prompt. Food was nice. We ordered Hokkien Mee at 50% discount for senior citizens.
Poor food and service,"The view at the restaurant is great, but the food and services are just way below standards. All the local delicacies were so poorly represented by this restaurant. For the price they are charging, the food tastes horrible. Their lobsters and seafood are not fresh and cooked to taste like rubber. I did not enjoy the experience at all. Service was bad, the waiters there were so aloof and didn’t even serve our drinks as ordered. Do not recommend this place at all."
Bright and Airy,"I went there for lunch with my husband and my children who were visiting Singapore at the time. We requested to be sat by the balcony, and the staff accommodated our wish. The view was wonderful, overlooking the green hillside. The downside was the spot would be exposed to direct sunlight and did get a bit warm. Solved just by moving the tables a bit. The food we ordered didn't disappoint. The Pork Ribs with Pineapple Glaze I and my son-in-law had was tender and not overly sweet. Could've used a bit of saltiness, but in all it was delicious. The Fish and Chips my husband had was plentiful and satisfying. Same with my son's steak. The Laksa my daughter had was hearty and spicy with a generous piece of lobster in it. It was a very good experience and I am glad I chose it for lunch with my loved ones."
"Nice view, good food",Nice way to end your visit at Sentosa with a cable car ride then a meal at Arbora. Memorable experience
Arbora Review,"Atmosphere was awesome, service was okay. The service staff did their best to accommodate all the customers and their various request."
Ambience and food and service was terrific!,The place was real cool especially for food and the promo to cable car ride! Good photo shoot with the bells of happiness!
Arbora,The food was good and served pretty fast.The atmosphere was just right to catch sunset at the top of mount faber peak.
"Amazing view, but food is subpar","Fortunately, we had reserved a sheltered corner with a view of the cable cars and Sentosa. We had steak and salmon. It was the toughest steak we'd ever had in a restaurant, and it was way overcooked. The salmon was cooked well on one side but tough on the other."
Nice place but food is not worth the ride up the hill,"Great atmosphere, windy for outdoor dining. Staffs are friendly, service is good. However, the food is a disappointment, still edible but doesn't taste that great, not terrible but just so-so, definitely not worth the ride up for the food, probably just the view and atmosphere. Was a great experience, it was the first try."
Be Patient,"The view is spectacular, food is good, prices acceptable but the service is slow - so be very patient and be prepared to make a lot of gestures to catch the waiters attention"
Abora - A Dining Experience for Retirees,"Both my retired friend and myself enjoyed the dining experience. We were greeted by very personable young waiting staff who are so genuinely sincere. Food was sumptuously yummy - lots of ingredients on our Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee; and fantastic view of the harbor front. It made our day !

I also overheard from fellow day trippers on the Sentosa Bus that the food at Abora is very very good."
Good food and nice scenery,Great location to see sunset and Sentosa island. The food was great and the service was excellent. I was there to celebrate my partner birthday and we enjoyed the evening very much.
Nice view with good food portion at a reasonable pricing,Went on a Sunday morning 9am for breakfast (5 adults + 1 child). The weekend breakfast options were extensive - we ordered 4 mains for 5 people share. Staff were attentive and there was a surprise Mother's Day gift as well.
"Dinner at Arbora restaurant, Mt Vaber","Good ambient, good food. There is valet service for free when we dine in . Service was good as well."
Service,"We 4 of us,Senior citizens order 3 sets Senior speical promotion sets which is $12 each set. But i didnt notice they charged me at $16.80 per set when i was there, realise only when back home!!!

And they open the lunch at 12noon, we were there around 12.15 which we had booked. but too bad, when we sit down, the Indian Biriyani set no more."
Great view marvelous food,2nd visit to Arbora. Good food great ambience. Just that the service can be improved. Decent price for the food and great selections.
Dining at Arbora,Love this place! Nice ambience with beautiful view. The lobster laksa was flavourful. The food here are not bad and reasonably priced.
Disastrous lunch!,"Service was poor, only 2 service personnel so service was slow & unfamiliar with the menu on offer. We were charged erroneous & casher refused to accept their errors in charging so ended up charging ur meals at their nornal price instead of the supposedly promotional offer & for that pricing the food were not worth it!!"
Family lunch,"Purchased DBS promo package (cable car + lunch) and redeemed on 24 Apr 2022.
It's been ages since parents and us took the cable car.
Good food, attentive service from Mandy and her team
Requested table with harbour view and had our lunch with nice scenery.
Will return"
Average,"Not as hype, the food we get is not really good. Fish & Chips, the fish was so tougher to cut and eat, may be due to Klook Voucher or in general not sure"
Unprofessional clueless staff and manager.,"We made a booking at 3pm. We were early and was seated at 2.50pm.

When we are ready to order, the waiter could not take the order and have to wait for a senior. Senior came but does not have an interest to recommend and we expected more from a senior.

We waited until 3.40pm and our main is still not ready. We left the place and feedback to the manager. He wasnt keen to even talk to us.

Expect the basic service from a place that charge service charge. The crew should all go for a refresher in service delivery."
"Highly recommended for the views, food, and service","My wife and I absolutely enjoyed ourselves here! We just celebrated what could have been our final date night together before turning parents, and what better place to do it than the same place we had our first date 5+ years ago The views were excellent, especially while watching the sunset. The food was sumptuous, including the mushroom ragout with duck, spaghetti bolognese, truffle fries, and vanilla ice cream shake. The service was excellent too, shout-out to our trainer server especially! We capped off our date night with a spur of the moment decision to sit the 30-minute round trip on the Singapore Cable Car , at a promotion of only $5 per pax because we dined here (versus usual $33) it was totally worth it. You also enjoy complimentary valet parking if you dine here. Thank you, Arbora!"
"Nice food, service can be improved.","I specifically requested for a table with the best view from the restaurant for a birthday celebration but it seemed like they did not take note of it. Not sure what's the purpose of leaving a "" note"" for the reservation if the restaurant is unable to provide such a simple request."
Great service,Very impressed with waiter Elan service! He went the extra mile to get the kitchen to prepare food for my elderly dad inspite kitchen already closed. Thumbs up for his great service from the heart!
Food & Service,"I have been there many times. Breakfast, lunch & dinner I love and enjoy my meals all the time. I shall visit Arbora again with my friends and by myself. I love the ice-cream too!"
