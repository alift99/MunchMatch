"Lots of variety, great stuffs",Great vegan options. I personally love the pani puri there. Good ambiance. Great taste. Lots of variety. Very recommended.
Love to go,"With my family, I visited this restaurant. Newly renovated branch on Belilios Road looks gorgeous, with nice architecture. Our recommendation is to try Chole Bhature and Dahi Puri. Dahi puri is very satisfying when you are hungry. I try to eat at least once a week."
Good Indian vegetarian food,"I had my dinner in this restaurant, it is next to ma kaali amman temple. The food in the restaurant is very nice. Good options in north indian and street food. I has ordered for veg biryani, paneer korma and sev puri. Good food."
Absolutely brilliant!,"We had the signature Bambaiya Dahl Puri which was not our favourite, yet still very good.

TheTikka Chaat was amazing - sweet, yet savory and an explosion of flavours. Highly recommend.

The Cheesy Masala Pav, a spicy blend of tomato onion gravy stuffed inside a butter laden pav (bun) blew my head off! I love a spicy curry, but this one left me for dead. However, stupidly I kept going back for more.

My carnivore father thoroughly enjoyed every bite of authentic Indian food. If it wasn't our last night in Singapore we would definitely be back."
Service not great,"I have been coming here since it has opened amd can see the service is grtting wordt even with staff

I Stood for 15mins to be sested, the place was empty, I then approavched 2 different people and thry said wait there as they were so busy with 3 tables being full. I thrn sae a couple came through the side entrance and just went to a table and sat down and the staff started serving them. I then I decided to go and sit down myself.

There was short guy with glasses, he just ignored me, he wasnt even wearing uniform,.was wearing a CK T shirt.

Even when u want to order or ask for the bill, they just ignore you. I even thought about just leaving as no one was bothered about taking my payment, then someone acknowledged me after 20 mins of waiting.

I always looked foward coming here, but now I dont think I will bother"
Pathetic standards,"I visited this restaurant on 24 July dinner .Was seated and waited about 25 minutes for some one to attend to me .I ordered Lemon corriander soup .The soup was served in a very sub standard way with no service plate & the soup cup was not even bothered to be cleaned even ,The bhel puri was to hot to handle .I did point this to the Manager over there .Standards are abysmally low .The restuarant does not care about all these I guess they have customers /tourist visiting them once .The AC grilles are full if fungus & water drips every where .It is very substandard & could be a victim of futrue food poisoining issues .be aware"
Good Food and service,Good food and always managed to meet our dietary requirements. Very good friendly service from Nalini from Singapore.
Bad hygiene and service,"Came back after 3 years. The hygiene and service levels have drastically reduced. The chutney had a white layer over it which looked fungal and the other jar had food stuck to it.
The cold coffee was served in a mug which had milk stuck to its bottom. The staff did not even bother to clean the outside of the jar before serving.
Food was average."
Need serious hygiene check up,"The food was average, the prices are a little bit high for this type of food and type of restaurant. The lady who cleaned the table has also handled food ( without washing her hands or using a sanitizer ) which is disgusting. They need counseling in food handling and table manners."
Staff discriminates. Go elsewhere if you aren't Indian or a local.,Absolutely disgusting service and treatment by staff. Their blatant racism persevered over professionalism. The female server refused to take our tables order and the male server skipped over a few members of our group while taking orders. They should be ashamed.
Horrible Experience,"Horrible experience with rude staff that ultimately led to me not receiving my order. On Diwali, I ordered using Grab Pick up for my entire family including my 2 year old daughter and elderly in laws. The order was accepted and shown to be in the kitchen with the order showing to be ready for 1.10pm. We arrived a few minutes early and waited for the order to be shown as ready to be collected on the app. At 1.10pm, it did, so we proceeded to the counter to be greeted by a rude and curt lady asking what we wanted. My wife showed the order number on the app and she responded that the order was not even accepted by them. My wife explained that it showed as order is in kitchen and then order is ready but they pretty much ignored us saying that they are too busy! I contacted Grab to see what the issue was, and when they attempted to reach out to Kailash Parbat, they did not answer the phone. The recourse? Order is cancelled and a S$3 refund was offered by Grab. That's not even as much as my transport cost me and does not resolve the issue of where I am supposed to get the food from. Kailash Parbat staff? They continued to ignore us and their phones!

I understand that it is Diwali and potentially the busiest day of their year, but simple customer service and being prepared would go a long way! Acknowledgingly, with the current COVID safety measures, orders from Grab and similar food delivery apps are going to be the norm, so ensuring that the phones are manned is paramount. I would have at least expected the restaurant to suggest that they could look at the order and prepare it then due to a mistake by their service provider. And Grab should be ashamed of themselves for such an insulting appeasement offer after acknowledging the time, effort and money spent on going to the restaurant and waiting just to leave with nothing.

For Kailash Parbat - as was obvious, they have no care for their customers and blame Grab systems but don't take any accountability when a customer has come to pick up an order, rather ignore them.
For Grab - blame Kailash Parbat for not answering their phone, and then blame them again for device potentially being faulty but don't take any accountability.
For the customer (me) - having pre-paid S$120 for a meal, wasting my time to get it, leaving hungry people at home on a religious day for me, to be passed all the blame by Kailash Parbat and Grab, and running around at 2.15pm trying to find somewhere to eat.

Thank you Kailash Parbat and Grab for showing that money matters more than customer service!"
Don’t waste your money for the brand.,"The quantity and the quality is too bad. Lost its charm no point spending any money here. Lame pav bhaji, potato and tomato Puree with pavbhaji masala, bambaiya dhai puri was like sweetest lassi filled puri. Ordered platter was worst. Never had such experience before.

Ordered veg momo was not even cooked.

I guess time to look for other places."
Worst dining experience in years,"Served outside packaged food, when confronted… claim shortage of staff ! Could have told upfront when I was ordering."
Home delivery worst service,"They are famous for unprofessional customer service. They dont inform the delay of the delivery and no one bothers to call. We have to call and chase them to know the status of the food. I recently placed an order overnight for the next day delivery, inspite of them having more than 15 hours of prep time they couldnt deliver the food on time and they absolutely dont want to take ownership for the delay saying it is not our problem"
Incredibly sweet service and fantastic food!,"We were totally new to this kind of Indian food, and were hesitant to try at first. But the warm and super welcoming service, made us take the plunge! And it was so worth it. We felt like tourists in our own country, and the whole experience was very enjoyable!

The staff taught us how to eat certain foods, explained some of the ingredients, and even specially made custom versions of dishes that my wife couldn’t take (she can’t eat chili). I have never experienced such homely attentiveness in a restaurant ever.

Definitely will return, and bring my friends and family too!"
Glass piece found in food,Ordered chole bhature and found glass like piece in the chhole.. cleanliness and safety both compromised.. never going to come back
Home delivery worst service,"The food u get for home delivery is totally different from what u get in the restaurant. They took 2.5 hours to deliver our food which was like eating leftovers from the day before. Veg manchurian had no vegetables in it and was tasteless. Chaat platter u get in home delivery is not good either. Don't ever order for home delivery from this restaurant. The waiting time is too much and even after waiting, the food u get is disgusting."
Food was too spicy for us to even enjoy,"Food orders: Pani Puri, Papdi bhalla chaat, daal makhani, paneer butter masala Each item was extremely spicy to the point of being inedible - and this is coming from a Desi!"
Avoid online ordering from their website,If you want to have your lunch as a stale snack then order online from their website. otherwise there are better and faster options to get delivered from other more reputable restaurants. They take 2 hours to deliver food...a reputable brand like them cannot speeden this process which is such a shame
The food is decent. Sometimes,The food is decent. Sometimes it’s good sometimes it’s mediocre. Service is also decent given what time you’re go and how packed they are. You have to keep asking for things and they “eventually” come. The hygiene of the place and waitstaff is questionable though. Every time I’ve been there my friends or husband mentioned that of smelled of urine and I agree. Always a ton of kids who are going around touching all the silverware etc that are sitting on the tables and no one bothers to clean them for the next round of guests after they have been touched by so many hands. Seats always have food and crumbs on them which patrons usually clean themselves. One time I noticed the waiter use his bare hands to tuck back some noodles that was falling off the bowl as he was taking it to the table to serve. Gross! This is Singapore not some roadside dhaba in India. Please set your bar higher.
"Comfort food, good staff","Kailash Parbat scores on all fronts - good food, friendly staff, decent prices, good location. We’ve been frequenting this haunt for a decade and hv always enjoyed their service n food. Special mention for Ms Jyoti & Mr Sunil from their Syed Alwi Rd Branch in Sg. Excellent staff members."
Arrogant Service Staff,"Your online feedback system seems broken. Below is my complaint:

""I was at your restaurant yesterday (3/10/2020), about 7:45pm. I usually go there mostly on Saturdays. I like the food, and the ambience of your restaurant. For some reason, the reservation system tablet wasn't working yesterday. A register book was kept in place instead. I saw people had written their names and numbers, so I did the same-- thinking that the names will be called in that order. A few moments later, a family of 3, and another person entered the restaurant, so I stepped back so they could write the names too. At the same time, one of the staff members got there and told the family and the other person that they don't have to write their names, instead they can just let him know. So he took note of their names, and I kept telling him that I had been there before them, and my name is written in the register. He didn't pay any heed to that, so I repeated myself, and he didn't even bother to look me in the eye this time. And he left. I tried calling him 3 times, but he did not care. I was just too hungry, and I did not want to create any scene there, so I left. I like your food, and your restaurant, that's the reason I frequent it. But what happened yesterday shows lack of respect towards customers. I can understand the reason for preferring larger groups, but that doesn't not mean that smaller groups can be conveniently neglected. I might not eat at your restaurant again because of what happened, but I hope at least this will be considered as a constructive criticism so that your staff is better trained to be respectful to everyone, irrespective of their group size. Thank you."""
Delicious north Indian food in nice setting,"This popular restaurant offers amazing food, a friendly staff in a nice atmosphere. If you go one time, you'll want to go back. Great for vegetarians."
"Chole Bhature , Gulab Jamun and Sev Barfi simply outstanding",Problem of Choice . To have the chat or the Chole Bhature or binge on mithais . We ended up doing all and had a wonderful time
Very bad customer service!,"This restaurant has very bad service! Please train your staff better!

I had placed a dinner order via the grabfood app at 230pm. The order was to be delivered at 645-7pm. The delivery arrived at 830pm. That is fine, i don't have an issue with that.

They missed one of the orders. It was definitely not a fault with the grab app as the receipt by the restaurant that was attached to the delivery items contained the missed item. I called the restaurant back upon receiving the order from the grab delivery person.

The staff who picked up acknowledged that they missed an item and told me that they will send it to me that night itself. I did not receive it. If you're not able to deliver on your promise call and tell me. If for whatever reason you are not able to call me, at least drop me a message as you have my number from the previous call.

I called back the next day and spoke to the manager of the belilios lane branch. The manager who was very rude, told me that the ""location where i stayed was too far to deliver"". He mentioned that he ""will add it to my next order"". I told him that it's not fair that i have to spend more at your restaurant when you have screwed up. He then added that ""he was very busy and to text him my address"". He didn't even bother to take it down. He also added that he will send over the missing order item ""either today or tomorrow"".

I have yet to receive this missing order which this restaurant owes me. I will proceed to make a complaint with GRAB and CASE if this order is not met. I can brush it off if it was a small amount but it's not.

Such an appalling attitude by your staff for speaking to me so rudely when it was your restaurant's mistake."
Rediscover the fabulous snacky street food of India,"One of the iconic casual snacks as well as street food chain from India. The branch at Little India does the mothership restaurant at Colaba , Mumbai proud.

The Chole Baturas are top nautch and so are the various chats of North India or the vada pavs, pav bhaji from the streets of Mumbai
Reasonable pricing and friendly staff also help in making the overall experience stand out"
No brainer for vegetarians,"Has the usual fare, tastes good and service is quick. I went as I had little time between arrival and meetings. Recommend if you are the picky Southasian vegetarian."
My wife birthday,It’s worth visiting here again n again #Amazingfood I always celebrate our special occasion here Specially thank to Manager Riaz he a gem thanks 😊
These hotel is best hotel,These hotel is best hotel for indian food in Singapore..best experience. Food quality is awesome.and staff is also very good .owner of these hotel is also a very nice person
Vegetarian Indian food,"A spacious, comfortable and clean restaurant in the heart of Little Indian. All the other customers seemed to be local and enjoying their food, a good sign. The staff were helpful and explained the choices well along with recommencing dishes. It was a reasonable price and very tasty. Only vegetarian food served, but that seemed normal for the area."
Great taste,Food was very tasty. The soup and the non veg options were very tasty. They could have morw options for the dessert
"Very good, central, spacious, very large menu, good servive","Excellent lunch, quick, helpful and efficient service. Highly recommended though not cheap. They accommodated my request for not very spicy, explained the differences between various vegetarian options, and met all expectations. A fine experience. The price on the high side."
Too spicy,"Went to eat here during my stay in Singapore. There are not very many restaurant that serve Punjabi food in Singapore. The seating is ok typical of an Indian restaurant. We ordered paprika chat, Chole Pathure, veg pullao. Asked them to make the food mild but it came out to be quite spicy. Rice were very basic and pathbreaking was chewy. We decided to take Gulab jamun with us to have with tea whe we return to our hotel room. I went there because of good reviews but couldn’t understand how people could review it so high as we found it just very basic. I went to use the toilet but had to come back as firstly the lights were not working and the smell and state of the toilets on the whole was disgusting. When I told the staff that lights are not working in the toilets I got the response “I know”. We left majority of the rice as they were tasteless and I left half the pathbreaking as it was far too chewy. Papri chaat was ok. And the price I paid was the same as we paid in our hotel restaurant so I will never visit it again even if I revisit Singapore."
"Good for Veg, Jain Options","It is like a brand recall if your are an Indian. You will feel like you are in Mumbai after entering the premise, after looking at the Menu & after having the food.

But all these come at a cost, it is a bit expensive relatively."
Bad service for home delivery and party catering.,Quality of the food is good. But I have to give 0 rating for their service.always late for min 1 hour.
Very very good vegetarian food,"Extremely clean restaurant located in Little India and close to the subway train station. Food is excellent, although on the pricier side. Amit, the manager, very friendly and helpful guy who ordered a grab for us when we didn't have wifi, no taxi would stop to take us to our hotel and no one else on the street would help us by using their phone to order a taxi for us. We then decide that the next day we will visit his restaurant for dinner and were not disappointed at all"
mouth watering vegetarian indian food,"recently we were in Singapore, and being pure vegetarian without garlic was a problem in Singapore. but kailash parbat made us at home with their gentle and vibrant attitude , fast services and real taste of india food . highly recommended."
Singapore holiday,We were looking for vegetarian restaurant for our dinner after visit to gardens by the bay. Our driver suggested us to visit this restaurant. We reached this restaurant the place was full but got table very quickly. Food was excellent and delicious. We wanted to visit again but couldn’t make it. Overall good ambience and excellent indian food.
Awesome North Indian fare on offer!,"After a busy evening including a Saturday evening visit to the bustling Kali Temple on Serangoon Road, we had two hungry tired children in tow with four adults equally tired looking for some authentic Kailash Parbat fare, not dissimilar to what’s on offer in Mumbai, India. Kailash Parbat Serangoon stood up to its reputation all right in awesomely authentic fashion. We had to wait 10-15mins to get seated but once in, the service was prompt & attentive and the food piping hot and mouthwatering! We tried the Chole Bature, Aloo Tikki, Paani Puri, Paav Bhaji, Dahi Puri & some Rice and Black Dal for the kids. For drinks, we tried the Mango Lassi, Masala Chaat & Fresh Lime Soda. Each item was ‘spot on ‘ in taste and it turned out a sumptuous meal. We are sure to return!"
BEST VEGETARIAN NORTH INDIAN FOOD IN SINGAPORE,"This is probably one of the best place to eat North Indian food in Singapore, even the chat items and sindhi food are best.
the food is the best & the service is excellent.
the staff is really good specially Mr. Rajesh, Mr. Riyaz & Mr. Amit.....all other team members are good at service.

Please note weekend evening the waiting time varies from 30 min to 1 hours."
Food is good but Extra 10% Tip is a pain,"Food is really good, its a bit costly. But the cherry on the Top will be 10% compulsory TIP.

You can not deny that extra 10%. So if bill is around 80 SGD for 4 then ultimately it will be 88 SGD. 8 SGD in Tip around 400 INR for TIP, seriously its too much for any Indian.

so went only once there its way too costly."
tasty food,very good food & location.. staff also very good.. we eat approx 4 / 5 times in 5 days.. but it was really nice food.. Service is also fast.. weekend is crowded... book your table early in weekend..
Delicious authentic Indian food!,"Located at heart of Little India and near the Hilton hotel, this restaurant serves a wide choice of Vegetarian only food. The food tasted authentic and delicious. It brought me back to memories when I spent my holidays in India previously. The table queue system is efficient and the service is rapid. Worth a try if you like spicy food!"
Chaat Supreme!,"Was missing Indian food on a short trip, and this was excellent. The chaats are wonderful, the dhal makani perfect, the bread authentic (butter naan!). No wonder it's frequented by locals. The bhel puri is nicely presented in a bicycle cone :)"
Good food but service slow,"Very nice food, authentic Mumbai chats, nice ambience. Took more time to prepare the food. More varieties"
Disappointed,I had so high hopes from this place but was utterly disappointed. I ordered the chaat platter and fresh lime soda. The fresh lime soda was horrible - I even asked to change it which they tried but it was still horrible. The platter looked good but was overall below average - could have been so so much better. I finally lost hopes from this place but ordered kulfi faluda - which was decent. The washroom was next to the place outside the entrance which required a code - weird!
Delicious North Indian dishes!,"The chaat platter is a must-try (except for those who can't take spice). So is the Kofta Dil Bahar, which we devoured with butter rotis. Saag paneer is tasty too. Lime soda complements these dishes. Reasonably priced at about 41 for two persons.
WE took home really good cashew burfi, for an additional price.
Average service quality. Simple interiors.
Will return."
"""Working Hours"" - 11:00 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.","These are the times advertised on the web site and at the restaurant. We arrived at 5:00 p.m. and were told that we could only order cold street food - i.e. hot dinner items were not available until 7:00 p.m.

Having had street food in several Indian cities, we were surprised that this Singaporean version was bland and tasteless. It was also VERY expensive. We dropped 25 SG and left most of the food on the table. We then went to seek dinner elsewhere."
Delicious food. Could be even better if service staff stopped looking so miserable,The food ordered was excellent. The layout inside is clean and tidy. I couldn't work out whether the waitress was just miserable or didn't like us for some reason. A smile and a greeting costs nothing and would have made our experience a little better. Note the rest room is located outside the building so ask for the code and directions if you need it.
The Hindu hotel beside Hindu Temple,"The location of the restaurant is just adjacent to the temple . So it is very easy to locate the restaurant. You are having options from chaat pakori to delicious
Sweets . All the main course are good in tastes and the dishes are brought in unique Utensils. You can look at the picture uploaded for sweet Lassi. Good food good tastes."
Best vegetarian restaurant in Singapore,"We visited this restaurant every day for dinner during our trip to Singapore. The food is amazing, good quality delicious food. Must try main course: Paneer tikka lababdar and Dil bahar kofta."
Excellent Indian Food,The place is famous for its cholle bathure and I would highly recommend the same. We stayed in singapore for 4 days and we had most of our meals here. The place is serving the indian food with same taste you get in India. They are serving everything from chaat to great north indian food. A must visit for Indian Food.
Excellent Indian food,"Great place for some great Indian food , specially for those fond of Indian street food . Decent ambience and service . Weekends can be super crazy and one will have to wait for sometime to get a table
Improvised menu and yummy food , one must visit"
Great food but sloppy service,The food there is amazing. You can order anything from the menu and it is going to taste great. The only problem is that the service is sloppy and slow due to lack of man power. If you don’t go early the waiting line can go as long as 2 hours. It is a sure visit to this place for Indian food
Decent vegetarian restaurant,"Had a dinner on one of the nights with my family here. We were living in the Hilton next door so the location was very convenient.

Food - The menu was extensive with vegetarian options only. The taste of the food was ok and nothing too great. I had higher expectations as the restaurant was pretty crowded and I was underwhelmed by two of the three dishes we ordered.

Service - Slow! It was a busy night but still could have been better. A server didn’t come to take our order for at least 15-20 mins while we just sat and waited.

Price - Reasonable and portions are big."
Good Indian food,"My hotel was couple of kms from little india and had to buy loads of souvenirs so little india we headed couple of times. Kailash parbat is known brand in India, so were pretty comfortable with it’s presence nearby itself. Food was good, basic simple tasty. We are vegetarians so Some ppl told us it would be tough for us to find suitable food in Singapore(i am going to repeat this statement in other reviews also for benefit of travellers). We had more veg food in Singapore than in india!! And good food. Stay near Little india or known veg restaurants and your woos are taken care.."
Delicious,"About 300-400 mtrs from Park Royal at Kitchener road, this restaurant is below Hilton Garden inn. Nice cozy place with some very good food and service. You can get anything from dal’s to chole bhature and they are delicious.
A must try restaurant while in Singapore."
Satisfied my taste buds,"My first day in Singapore.. I was with my in-laws Nd two small kids nd my husband.. being a vegetarian.. I searched for Indian restaurant.. so I tried many restaurant there later .. but as 1st day my nd mine whole family’s taste buds were satisfied..
The food they serve is excellent.. there preparations nd way serving is superb.. thy r very polite..my husband late for lunch ..as he had some work we were waiting for him in the restaurant for 1hour..the food served on his plates for him was not hot as he was late .., this was seen by the manager ... The manager was so nice lady .. on arrival of husband.., she microwaved the food .. so that it can hot nd better to eat

Yes it's quite expensive compared to other restaurants.. But then too ..Ur stomach is satisfied even the tastebuds

I am taking about the resurant in little India next to the temple ..it's best.

And guys this has branch near Mustafa centre too but there manager is too rude .. even they do not serve properly"
"Good snacks and sweets, main course was OK","Visited Kailash Parbat a couple of times over the past month. Firstly the place is kid-friendly which is great for families. The first time we went we only ordered snacks and dessert. The chole, pav bhaji and pani-puri were excellent and the pan kulfi was great. The next trip we ordered mains and one indian chinese dish. The paneer butter masala was ok and the gobi manchurian was disappointing. Overall still a good place to visit for good Indian food."
Best of Best Chaat Place in Singapore,"Can not explain it much but Amazingly delicious Chaats choices & Beautiful menu preparation..!!

Service can be improved , though few of them are always happy to Serve the customer well .

Would love to see some Maharashtraian Food choices on the menu .

Have visited several times but You will see me more often soon

Thank you"
needs improvement in food quality,"We ordered the following food:
aamchi mumbai sandwhich
pav bhaji
manchow soup

As compared to the indian food that we have in India , this preparation lacked that extra ""bite n sting"". The food was comparitively bland and the sandwhich was a let down.
This place looked popular as even at the late hour of 10 pm there were quite a few people having dinner."
Best place for Chats in town,"Everytime we want to treat ourselves with chats we head to Kailash parbat. Nice ambience, very good service, top of all yummy food..."
Trusted taste for midrange dining,"Chaat items are great, and so is Chhola Bhatura. Can’t go wrong with these choices every time you visit. Paneer pakora and kulfi are good too."
Good Indian food.,"The food was nice, with Indian taste, specially North Indian. Hindi speaking people with Hindi music overseas gives an extra star abroad where spicy food is scarce. Worth."
Good food but can get crowded,We visited here in January and the place is good. The food is very tasty and the service is great too. Food arrives pretty fast and cooked to perfection. The only negative is that it can get crowded and then you cant hear your family members or friends sittinf across from you.
Best place to enjoy authentic Indian meals in Singapore !!!,"Kailash Parbat located in Little India is probably the best place to have authentic, tasty Indian cuisine in Singapore. There are very few places in this country where one can enjoy genuine, tasty, Indian meal, especially Vegetarian, and this is one of the best !!! The location is on the main road in Little India. Place is quite big and well designed. Interiors remind us of India, especially Mumbai. Loved the food quality and taste. Service was prompt. Had a hearty meal in Singapore after quite a few days, so the pleasure was even more !!!"
Awesome Jain Vegetarian food,Kailash Parbat food made our stay in Singapore like home as we needed Jain Veg food. Awesome variety and tasy food. Great service.
A Bad Experience,Kailash Parbat was not such a delight to us as the food was average and not worth the money. The music was very loud and awfully annoying. The sweets were really bad and too sugary. The cottage cheese was stinking and all the food was with lots of cream. The way the waiters took the glasses was so unhygienic and they were not in proper uniform. Do not try this restaurant and go for some other one in Little India. You can try if you want but the restaurant was average and below our expectation. That's why I give it TWO STARS.
Great food and service,"Food tasted authentic as if you are eating in India. Very good service with very less waiting time. Lastly, huge variety to select from. Again, thanks for the great food and service."
Review on the food,We ordered the pani puri platter there it was one of the best chats we have eaten in singapore even the pav bhaji is excellent there the staff is courteous and humble. We also ordered falooda kulfi there wich suld be given a double thumbs up. Overall a great experience we had on our family trip. Also its not too heavy on the pocket. Highly recommend this place for vegetarian food.
Hygienic?,"My family and I often visit this restaurant because the food is great! Every time we go there, this Chinese lady who clears tables will talk to us. This time however, she asked us, “is the food nice?”. And we said yes of course. Then she shocked us by saying, “I see how they make it in the kitchen so I never dared to eat the food here.” Firstly, she made us all lose our appetite and secondly, she kept coming back and repeating it to us. I don’t think I’m going back there anytime soon. You should consider having her fired because she ruins your customers appetite and badmouths your restaurant."
Great eat for a vegetarian,"In Little India under the Hilton. Ambience is great and service is excellent. Orders are delivered very fast and quality & taste are 5 stars. Visited it twice on a 6 day stay. Food slightly pricier when compared to other surrounding restaurants but it is worth it.

Has a wide spread including Chaats"
Worst service and poor quality of food,"We arrived at the restaurant at approx 5pm. The restaurant was empty and the host could not be bothered to make an effort to acknowledge us or sit us down. Finally once seated and menus given to us we looked through the menu and decided what to order. When we called the waiter over to place the order only at this point he said they are only serving a limited menu and full menu is served after 7pm. They could have told us when we arrived that they only serve a restricted menu. We ordered papdi chaat, pau bhaji and lime juice. They must have had these items on tap as they were bought out to us in under 3 to 5mins. The lime juice contained more water than lime, the papdi chaat must had no flavour and the pau bhaji was aweful. The prices these guys charge are so expensive and the food is the worst I have ever experienced. There are much better restaurants around the vicinity for example Raj on the Race Course Road, they are a more professional outlet."
Hit and Miss Chaat But Awesome Dal Khichdi,"Somehow Kailash Parbat's outlet in Little India doesn't get any reviews - people are perhaps posting their reviews on the other outlet. Nonetheless, this place is supposed to be your go to place for Chaat even in the streets of Little India where there are so many other options. We went there on our first night itself thinking that if we liked the place we could eat here often during our 5 day stay. But sadly we never returned because we were not completely satisfied.
For starters we ordered a Sev Puri (SGD 7.5 +) and Ragda Dahi Puri (SGD 9+). The Sev Puri was spicy and delicious just like you would get in India. But the Ragda part of the Dahi Puri turned out to be disappointing - it was bland and basically boiled chickpeas - completely without flavour. We didn't eat more than half the dish and decided to order main course (which we hadn't planned to) - Daal Khichdi (SGD 12+) - which was the hero of the day. Piping hot and just how they taste in local Mumbai restaurants - it was absolutely delicious.
The service was prompt. They were also kind enough to see that our kid was not enjoying the chaat and gave him a complimentary bowl of muri and namkeen mixture. Rates are slightly on the higher side for the chaat but would have been worth it if the flavours were right. A 34 SGD bill for 2 chaats and a single main course is one of the more expensive tabs you will pay in Little India."
amazing Indian Food,Right in middle of Singapore.. if you have a craving for quality Indian Street food.. this is the place. . tried Dahi Bhalla Papdi.. dal makhani.. garlic naan.. everything was amazing.. comfortable sitting and not too expensive.. loved it
"Good Food ,Good Service But Prices on High End","Food was good, Service also good, but pricing seems to on quite high side , seems 100% top up on STD pricing"
Excellent Food and Service,"I would recommend this place for authentic Indian Chaats. My personal favourite in KP is Vada Pav and Pani Puri. And the lassi here is just delicious. Sandwiches are quite tasty, but they seem to be a little on the dry end for me. The staffs are quite friendly and helpful. Overall an excellent place to relish some Indian foods in a budget friendly way."
Ethnic tasting Indian cuisine.,"Stumbled upon this resturant by pure connivance. My mother is a falooda lover. Different types of falooda are served here all tasting amazing.
The sandwiches had a very rustic taste only found in some places in india so i was more than glad to visit this fine establishment twice during my visit to singapore. The staff ( specially the waiter who has a sister in saudi) made us feel extremely welcome and engaged in conversation and helping us to choose from the menu."
Good,Come and indulge in Some excellent quality of Indian food please do visit with your friends and family I personally recommend
Reputation,"I am an avid fan of KP and its Pani Puri in Mumbai and as usual it has its own reputation of serving delicious food and it did not disappoint me either.

The best part is the taste of PP is exactly the same. It was my first visit to Singapore outlet and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
the food is good but service extremely poor,"As I entered the restaurant I was escorted to my table and served with water.

the person who came to take the order was least bothered and was busy chit chatting with another client. We ordered our food first we received a dish that was not for us. He placed the platter and then apologized saying it was not for us. he again said it was for us, we checked and told him it wasn't then again he apologized. (was a very casual apology though). After a few minutes again he got us some food which was not hours and again we told him and then he went to another table. and finally our food arrived.

The taste was good, nothing great but good food. The juice came flat and we had to tell him to get ice. normally they should ask while ordering.

When we left again no smiles.

above all this the restaurant had around 100 people capacity but there were only 8 guests including us so imagine this mess with 4 serving staffs. imagine with more clients.

finally we went out and ate a busy food joint which was ananda bhavan trust me had great food !!!

There is another restaurant called gokul which is also a good indian restaurant nearby"
Indian chaat in singapore.,"They have 3 outlets in Singapore, I visited two of them and both are good.
They have a huge variety in Chaat like bhel puri, paani puri, pao bhaji etc.
North Indian and south indian is also good.
loved the royal falooda.
Almost all staff is indian and they also speak Hindi.
Prices are also reasonable a family of four had starters, chaat , main course and desserts all for some 65 singapore dollars."
Best Pure Veg family restaurant,"This is the only pure Veg North Indian restaurant as far as I know.

Food quality was great, ambience is good too, good housekeeping, crowd good too.
Sometimes need to wait to get the table for dinner, mainly on weekends.

Kailash Parbat has to branch there in Little India, One is just under the Hilton garden inn, Serangoon road.
2nd is in front of Mustafa centre.
Both are good and have same food quality."
BEST VEGETARIAN DISHES IN SINGAPORE,"The choice of food was varied. We ordered for Butter Naan, Paneer Masala and Dal Fry. Food was delicious. The waiting time was less than normal. The crowd was good."
Amazing Chaat!,Love their Chaat items and their Indian Daals are not bad either! Go-to place for Pani Puri ! On the pricer side though. Tasty mithai / indian sweets as well. Service could have been better and seating arrangement in both outlets can be improved.
Terrible chat item,They only waste time ob decorating item Very expensive Staff not polite specially if you go in the afternoon and slow service Bad experience 👎🏻
Best Food we had in Little India,"We were group of 7 members, all Vegetarians and looking for some good options for dinner. One of my local friend suggested about this place. And her suggestion was absolutely right. We get the best veg food with authentic Indian taste and lots of veg options here. Delicious food.. Little costly but taste recover all."
Great food in a platter,Amazing Desi food and gives one good variety of chats and other Indian delights. Don't miss out the soups there as well.

Average Chhat,"We went there for Chat, but it turned out to be just OK. Lunch choices are also available with reasonable service/I will say overall Average"
Heaven for Veggies,"If you are a vegetarian and wish to have Indian food, you can visit this place not only to satisfy your hunger but also to enjoy the food. A bit expensive but if you can find tasty Indian delicacies at Singapore, it's worth."
Very nice and tasty lunch,The lunch choices were very good. The food quality was very good and even the quantity was enough for 2 people in 1 vegetable.
Amazing!,"Wow, what can do say! I wish I lived next door!

The food is amazing and the service is good. We had puni puri, chole bhature, tandoor paneer, kulfi and ras malai. Everything was amazingly good. I also had a mango lassi. I am not usually into lassi but this one was wonderfully thirst quenching!

I am looking forward to my next visit and there are so many dishes in want to try!"
The food is very tasty but also heavy so go here only if very hungry,"We took the Bhatura platter (big mistake as the bhaturas were flat and oily) , Cholas, Paneer kadhai and a mixed vegetables. Very tasty but lots of cream and oily
Would recommend ordering Bhaturas separately as you get fresh Bhaturas
Seating is comfortable and service is good"
Good Indian food..!,"Liked food a lot amidst Singaporean cousin (If u miss Indian food there). Pros: Good taste, hygiene, accessible,u will meet lot of Indians there Cons: Rude staff, economical."
