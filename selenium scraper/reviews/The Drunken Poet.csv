Delicious food and drinks,"Ordered the baby back ribs and fish and chips, amazing portion size l, they were delicious and complemented well with the smooth Guinness"
Lovely Food,"A thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish! The moment we stepped into The drunken poet we were pleasantly greeted by one of their staff members. She readily offered recommendations and we settled for some fish and ships as well as a rack of ribs. My goodness, the ribs were fall off the bone and probably one of the best ones I’ve had!!! The fish batter was crispy and paired perfectly with the smooth Guinness pint. Top points to the restaurant for serving up such great food and such a lovely pour of Guinness. Will definitely recommend"
drunken poet,"good food, good ambience. food was good and portion sizes were reasonably big. music and decor was a nice touch as well"

Drunken Poet’s baby back ribs,"Got the guinness baby back ribs and paired it with a classic irish guinness. The ribs were really tender and the staff were really nice too. Overall, a really refreshing experience to try an Irish pub in little Singapore!"
great ambience & food,"friendly staff, good food (tried the chicken pie) & nice ambience! would really recommend checking it out as it's really convenient at orchard towers"
10/10 vibes,Loved the overall vibe of the place and the fish and chips were tasty and had great portions! Also my first taste of Guinness and it was really smooth
Nice vibes and generous food,"The entire restaurant has a nice and chill tavern vibe, perfect for friends to hang out. The roasted beef was well-seasoned and tender. However, the beef could have been done a little rarer. The portion was also really generous!"
Good Irish cuisine,"The Drunken Poet never disappoints! Have been here multiple times with my friends to enjoy Irish cuisine. Portions are very generous. The baby back ribs are my absolute favourite, the meat tears off easily and it's so well seasoned. The accompanying fries is also very tasty! Recommend this Irish pub to everyone!"
Yummy food and drinks,Restaurant had a nice ambience. Food was very filling and special shout out to the drink that was very thirst quenching! Will be back

BIG BIG Fish And Chip,"Wow... I've never seen such a big big portion of the poet's fish and chips, have to share it with my sister to eat it all. Enjoyed the crispy fish chip dip with various sources. There was a great World Cup atmosphere here. Must bring my buddy come here."
Simple date night,"Ambience is great and staff is friendly - good place for a chill date night.

Food wise, food is fresh (esp the fish) and the beef pie was deceivingly good. Had us fighting for it. Ideally wouldnt want so many peas in my dish, but think this is just a personal preference - my girlfriend finished it.

Catch happy hours before 8pm and you can get more pints to finish the night with."
amazing food in a warm cozy ambience,"really enjoyed everything about this place! food was fantastic -
Fish and chips: fish was extremely fresh and a very generous portion too
Beef pie: beef was so tender and savoury - this was hands down my favorite of the meal
Beer: also got two Guiness half pints and it paired with the dishes so perfectly

overall a great experience and would be back again for a chill evening! :)"
Cosy pub with nice Irish food in Orchard,"Heard about Drunken Poet from friends, have tried it a couple times so far.

It’s a nice place that’s not along the “main stretch” of Orchard, so you might miss it if you’re not looking out for it. Food is decent, I like their beef dishes. Had the stew last time so had the beef pie today. Their beef is generally nice and tender, also very flavourful. Can’t describe well but love it.

My wife ordered the fish and chips so I tried a bit, the fish was fresh and not jelat, which is a good sign for fish and chips. Overall a nice place to chill and grab some beers + Irish pub food~"
Irish pub tucked in a cosy corner,"This place never disappoints! Second time here and tried their Fish and Chips. Very generous portion, yet I can’t have enough. I like how the skin is crispy and lightly salted. The salad is drizzled with balsamic vinegar, which really elevated the taste of the entire dish."
"Great food, awesome ambience!",Had a great time at drunken poet! The food was fantastic and the customer service was just exceptional. Will definitely be back!
Juicy RIBS,"I had an wonderful experience at the drunken poet, the staff was friendly and her recommendation was good! I had the Chef's Babyback Ribs and a mocktail. The ribs was juicy, tender and well-seasoned. I would totally recommend this restaurant!"
A hidden gem in Orchard. Do check it out!,"Food was good. Atmosphere was good. Service was good.

Their new dish, the pub style beef & onion pie was awesome. Really enjoyed the crisp of the pastry and the juiciness of the beef inside.

Had a great experience overall. Do remember to get a pint of Guiness as it pairs well with most of their dishes."
Delicious cuisine and a cozy environment,"The Beef and Onion pie's flaky crust is covered with a hot gooey cheese, and the beef brisket in the pie were savory and soft. The potatoes on the side are buttery and nicely seasoned which further enhance the flavor. The fish and chips batter was crispy and tasty, and it went perfectly with the refreshing Guinness beer."
Interesting Irish-style pub,"The fish and chips were so crisp and delicious, together with the fries sides that paired well with the fish. The refreshing and cooling Guinness nicely complemented the fish and chips and Pub Style Beef & Onion Pie. The beef brisket in the Beef and Onion pie was tender while the crispy crust further elevated the taste. Overall, highly recommended visiting this Irish-style pub that would make a good spot to chill after work or at the weekend!"
Best Fish & Chips,Easily one of the best fish and chips I have ever had! It was so crispy and even came with an incredible portion size and a generous amount of sides. The fries were also really crispy and the salad was great too! Would recommend pairing it with an ice cold Guinness as a drink to really get the full experience of an Irish bar! The meal was so good that I even found myself craving it again the next day! Will definitely come back again!
Watching football along with dinner,Atmosphere was great along with the food. Was able to watch a football match and enjoy drinks with them. Music was not too loud and customers did not have to raise their voice to communicate
Authentic Irish Pub along Orchard Road,"Stumbled upon this authentic Irish Pub along Orchard Road. Great food and vibes! Food portion was really generous and prices were reasonable.

Fish and Chips were well fried but could do even better with more seasoning. The ribs were really tasty and tender.

Great place to unwind and chill out with friends while enjoying the tasty food and a pint of beer!"
Chill vibes Irish Bar,"Drunken poet is a great place to wind down after a long day of walk in town. They were generous with their food serving and food were served piping hot! Fish and Chips were extra crispy and I liked that I was given malt vinegar to go with it. I also had the Chef’s Babyback Ribs - very tender and flavourful! Love the chill vibes at the bar, perfect for drinks - had Guinness on tap! Will definitely visit again!"
Great pub atmosphere in town!,"A really nice pub in the middle of Orchard with really nice atmosphere! The staff were very friendly as well. The Chef's Babyback Ribs were nicely marinated and not overpowered by BBQ sauce, while the Pub Style Beef & Onion Pie was super enjoyable! Will visit again!"
Cosy atmosphere and delicious food,"Visited the Drunken Poet for dinner over the weekend and had an excellent meal & experience there. The atmosphere was cosy and service was quick and welcoming, with the staff ensuring that we were comfortable and ensuring our needs were met. We enjoyed the Beef & Onion Pie and the Ribs, both of which tasted delicious. the highlight was the pie, with its crisp crust enveloping the tender beef brisket, was flavourful and satisfying. Paired with a glass of Guinness, a worthy meal to end the weekend on."
Great food and beer,"Food was delicious and portions were large. Particularly enjoyed the pie - buttery, flakey crust, hot gooey cheese and a savory filling. However, the roast beef was a little tough for my liking, though I really enjoyed the yorkshire pudding that came with it.

I'm not usually one to drink beer, but I really liked the Guinnes beer which I felt was one of the best I've ever drank. It was smooth, creamy and balanced.

Staff was super friendly as well. Ambience made for a great place to catch up with friends and talk over good food."
Comfy bar,"The drunken poet has a very comfy ambience, and is a great place for a meal with close friends and family. I ordered roast beef, which came with yorkshire pudding, veggies, mashed potato and brown jus for the meat. The meat was well seasoned and went well with the sauce, and the yorkshire pudding was a tasty and fluffy pastry which reminded me of fresh youtiao. Good experience overall, would reccommend!"
Great ambience,Had a pleasant experience at The Drunken Poet. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great to kick back and have some drinks with friends. The shepherd's pie was really yummy and paired well with the garlic bread. Would recommend The Drunken Poet to anyone looking for a nice quaint bar in the city to have a few drinks and food with friends!
Cozy Irish Pub in Orchard,"A cozy pub with a really nice decor, a really nice place to enjoy a beer with friends. The food was homely and comforting, especially on the rainy day that we visited. The Roast Beef ($28) was tender, served with a nice savory Yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes. The Beef and Onion Pie was hearty and flavorful, alongside the side of peas, potatoes and carrots. Overall, I enjoyed spending my time here catching up with friends over food and drinks. Would recommend this pub if you're ever in the area!"
great bar with awesome ambience,best end to the day with delicious western food and a glass of a classic guinness stout! a fan of their fish and chips as it was fresh and crispy! highly recommend this place for a chill night out with friends!
lovely ambience,"had a good time with our guinness stout! fish and chips were amazing, succulent tender fish with crispy batter, nothing else you could ask for! great place for a good time with your friends!"
Wonderful experience,"Had a really nice dinner experience drunken poet! The service was really prompt and the owner was very warm and welcoming, which she ensured that we were comfortable and had our needs met at every stage of the service. The ribs and shepherd's pie were amazing, with the ribs being really tender and juicy, while the pie being indescribably good. Would definitely be back!"
Good food and a nice place to chill with friends!,A cozy pub to chill with friends and watch EPL football. Staff is super friendly and the food was good as well - ribs were tender and the fish & chips were of a generous portion. Really enjoyed the Guinness too!
Tender and well marinated ribs,"Amazing food at this pub! Complimented with the Guinness beer, ribs were in large portions and very nicely marinated. Even the sides (thick-cut fries) were great! Love the ambience and would definitely those in town to visit. Gave a different vibe from conventional pubs in Singapore. Definitely worth a try! :)"
Delicious and Authentic Shepherd's Pie,"The vibes of the place was really nice and cozy, not too brightly lit or dark. Had the shepherd's pie which was really tasty and authentic, especially since it was made with lamb mince! The Guinness was really nice as well."
fishnchips & babybackribs,Great place to unwind at Orchard after work which is relatively convenient and accessible. Vibes at this place were on point with a really rustic decor and ambience. Food was great which was paired with great service.
Irish VIBEZ,"This place is cozy and it's a very nice place to chill. Had tried the Irish roast beef and it's quite good. The meat is tender and it came with a generous portion. To add on, the roasted veges are amazing. Especially the carrot does not have a raw aftertaste and it's surprisingly sweet and tasty. Overall, I would say the dish is worth for the price and nothing has disappointed me yet!"
Nice place to chill with friends over drinks and nice food!,"I like that the location is very accessible as its located right in town. I ordered the baby pork ribs and the meat was very tender it falls off the bone easily and the sauce paired nicely with the meat too!

The thick cut fries was great too not overly salty and was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The salad at the side was nice too.

I also got the cranberry juice it was a nice and refreshing drink to freshen you up."
A chill hangout spot in Orchard,"The pub was conveniently located just a short distance away from the MRT! The second I entered the pub, I was amazed by the cozy and stylish interior. Tried the Shepherd's Pie and their Guinness beer – and they were pretty decent! Would recommend it if you're looking for a chill spot to hangout with your friends near Orchard."
Good food and cozy atmosphere,"Was a good night at the Drunken Poet even though there was no live soccer that week. The bar still had delicious food and amazing service, as well as a stylish and unique interior design that just looked awesome."
wonderful food and atmosphere,"wonderful dinner at drunken poet! the owner was super friendly and made sure that we were comfortable, and service was very prompt. had the baby back ribs and shepard's pie, both of which were amazing! ribs were incredibly tender and the meat fell right off the bone, while the pie was just.... no words can describe it! definitely recommend this bar and will be returning again!"
Fish and Chips,"Fish was very fresh and well cooked. However, a little bland but can be fixed with sprinkling a dash of salt!"
Good food and amazing vibes,"The baby back ribs were tender and well-cooked. The meat goes together very well with the chips and the chilled beer. But the best part about the experience would be the atmosphere of the pub. From the dimly lit lights to the soothing music playing in the background, this pub ensures everyone can enjoy their relaxing time here.
Overall an excellent place to unwind and relax for your evening"
Irish pub serving food + live sports,"Pretty decent place to visit for good Irish fare + watch live sports. The servers were prompt and friendly - which is always a plus. The decor of the place was atypical for a pub - dimly lit, but offering some cosy homely vibes as well.

Food wise - was recommended the crispy chicken burger and babyback ribs.. had a go at their Irish beef stew as well, which was a personal favourite.

All in all a place worth returning - especially when im in town area."
AMAZING VIBES,"Came to The Drunken Poet for the vibes and stayed for the food! Got myself the Poet's burger and a Guinness, which were both prepared to perfection. For the beer, the staff placed alot of emphasis on the pouring to make sure the quality is good. The patty of the burger was thick and juicy, along with crispy onion which enhanced the taste of the burger. Everything went well together and complemented each other.
Overall, the vibes were immaculate and it was really a great pub experience and this is a must-return in my book!"
"Bar, Burgers, Beer, and Arsenal BEATING down Fulham","Had a burger with my gal pal while watching highlights of Arsenal come from behind against Fulham. Burger came with fried onions and bacon, which was a big plus. Enjoyed myself thoroughly with a Guinness as well. Staff super friendly (Thanks Ivy!) and place had a real nice vibe to it.

Music wasn't too loud so the pub's good for a chat too."
Awesome food and beautiful decor,"Awesome food and service. I walk past this place almost everyday to work but only just tried it. The interior is really well decorated and feels like you're not in sg! I had the fish and chips and it was really good. I'm usually not a fan of fish and chips because of the batter but here the fish was flaky and moist, and it didn't feel heavy at all. Super enjoyable! I also tried my partner's poet's burger and it was delicious (I'll get it next time). Don't forget to get a guiness when you're here too. Had a great time :)"
Superb food and ambience,"Came here for a date night and we really enjoyed the chill vibes. Food was good - we ordered both the burger and shepherd’s pie to share. Our friendly server Ivy actually recommended the shepherd’s pie to us and it did not disappoint! Warm and comforting on a gloomy evening (with bread to mop up that delicious, saucy minced lamb). Burger was great too (didn’t get to try much of this because my partner loves burgers and ate it all before i could get a few bites in). Got a Guinness as well and it was real smooth and paired well with the food. Two thumbs up for the food and ambience!"
The Drunken Poet,"Fish and chips came in a very generous portion. The fish was nicely done, still moist with crispy exterior. Chips were on the crunchier side, overall pleasant dish. Guiness was nice and refreshing"
good vibes,"got the roast beef and it was really tender! the sides were great and i especially liked the sauce that came with the dish. i enjoyed the vibes of the place, it was really cozy with great music. staff were attentive too! would come back for the generous portions of good food! happy evening"
Great Irish Gastropub,Excellent Irish food! The burger was really juicy and I love the addition of the caramelised onions too. The Guinness beer was smooth and creamy too! Great place to come if you are looking for good food and drinks with great ambience
Smooth Guinness,"Here for the first time and on a Sunday night so relatively quiet and didn’t mind that at all. We ordered the Guinness Beef Brisket Stew, Crispy Chicken Burger and Babyback Ribs and of course, paired our food with a smooth Guinness.

Their stew was the highlight dish - served with toasted bread, the beef was cooked till soft and gravy texture was just nice and flavourful.

Love their soft and crispy brioche bun of the chicken burger and their flavourful crispy chicken !

Overall experience was good."
Amazing Dishes,"Ordered the beef stew and a half pint of Guinness. The beef stew was creamy and decadent, and the beef was so tender! The lightly toasted garlic bread complemented the stew really well. The glass of Guinness was quite rich, and I enjoyed it even though I don’t usually go for beer. Will definitely be back again!"
Poet Burger and Fish N Chips,"I especially enjoyed their Poet Burger and Fish N Chips because they were really tasty and quality ingredients were used to make their dishes. Another thing that stood out was their ambience, it was rly chill and homely for my friend and I visiting."
The Drunken Poet,"Came here for a date and the waitress recommended the Steak and Fries as well as the Shepherd's Pie to us, and we're glad that we took her recommendation! The steak was so tender and juicy, and the fries were so crispy. The Shepherd's Pie was a pleasant surprise, but do be wary that both dishes could be too much for 2 to finish"
Date night!,Great place to have a drink! Also my first time trying Irish food and its really tasty. Feels cosy at this place!
drinks after work,the fish and chips are really good especially with the vinegar. good portions too. goes really well with the beer. really nice decor with irish pub vibes.
My new favourite pub!!,The bangers n mash was really delicious!! The fried onions topping it was delightfully crunchy and savoury. It paired well with the half pint of guinness too
GREAT FOOD GREAT AMBIENCE,I ordered the poet’s burger and the portion is really filling! The Guinness taste strong and fantastic! The ambience is very unique and doesnt feel like any other bars in Singapore. Will definitely return again with my friends!
Fantastic Food & Atmosphere!,"The pub has a nice ambience and I would definitely recommend it as a great place to hang out with your friends or for a chill night out. I enjoyed my time eating dinner together with half a pint of Guinness and the staff working there was really friendly as well!

In addition, we had the Grilled Bacon & Cheesewich and it tasted way better than it looks! The sourdough bread was toasted to perfection and combined with the bacon and cheese? **Chef's kiss**"
Food Review at The Drunken Poet,"Went down to The Drunken Poet for dinner and drinks yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed it. Really want to emphasize how good their Guinness was, as it was super smooth and the staff was very nice to share with us that their Guinness are draft and not stout and they place alot of emphasis on the pouring to make sure the quality is good. Apart from the drinks, we had really good mains which went well with the Guinness. So we ordered the Poet's Burger which the patty was thick and juicy, along with crispy onion which enhanced the taste of the burger. We also had the traditional irish roast beef which was super delicious as well. Particularly the jameson whiskey brown gravy went well with the roast beef slices, yorkshire pudding and roast vegetables.
Overall, it was really an enjoyable meal and i would definitely return for their Guinness and strongly recommend to give it a try"
Guinness Fever!,"Delicious irish meals and craft guinness beer! Honestly, I have only tried stout Guinness and its my first time trying their craft beer version - and I must say it tastes absolutely amazing! It was soo smooth, not even bitter and I absolutely loved the foam! As reccomended we had The Poet’s Burger ($22) and the Irish Roast Beef ($28)! The burger was absolutely stunning especially with the way they did their crispy fried onions, it went so well with the tomato sauce and beef patty, giving it that additional oomph of umami and textural dimension! The irish roast beef was delicious as well and it was my first time tryinf yorkshire pudding! It was super unique like an airy egg frittata! And the roasted veggies were a nice addition as well. We also tried their popular cocktail which was a musk melon flavoured cocktail! And I must say it was really good! It is a light cocktail so the alcohol is really faint but the fruity flavours were present and that additional dried orange slice help add another flavour dimension which was unique in a good way!

Also the staff here were extremely nice and friendly and even gave us good reccommendations as well as telling us about different Guinness beers, and more!

Will definitely be back with family and friends in this nice cozy place for some craft beers and light drinks ☺️"
"Great drinks, great food, great atmosphere!","Came for dinner on a Tuesday night, and the bar wasn’t too packed, which meant that the food and drinks arrived pretty quickly, and I could have an enjoyable catch up session with my friend. I got the Shepherd’s Pie and shared the Irish potato cakes with him. Both items were delicious, and the food was piping hot when they arrived. Wash it down with a couple of pints of Guinness and the dinner really couldn’t have been more perfect."
Great food and music,"Great music, cool interior and really tasty food! What a great hidden gem in Orchard towers (it’s outside on the first floor).

We had fish and chips and the roast beef. Both dishes surprised our expectations. The fish was flaky and fresh, the batter perfectly crispy. The beef was tender and tasty. As a certain chef on Hell’s Kitchen says “it’s some good f***ing food”.

The beer was nice and cool, if you like Guinness you’ll like it.

The music was great. If you like songs from the 90s, 2000s and 2010s, they have a great playlist. Loved the vibes and the bar decor."
Great vibes and food,Came here on a Tuesday night and had a great experience. The food served rather quickly and we really enjoy the potato and bacon cakes especially when served hot and crispy. The babyback ribs are soft and tender and does not take much effort to remove the bones as well. The mixed sausages are quite interesting as we get to try out different flavors too. Would definitely come back in the future!
Great beer and food,"Highly recommend this hidden gem in Orchard Towers! The place has a great vibe, good music and food - had delicious fish & chips and roast beef, paired with refreshing glasses of Guinness and Heineken beer."
Lovely pub and good food,"Visited The Drunken Poet for dinner, and had a lovely experience ☺️ The food came really quickly and I thoroughly enjoyed the traditional Irish roast beef, especially the whiskey met sauce.

The staff were very welcoming and friendly, the place well decorated and has a super cozy atmosphere. Overall, a very warm and inviting pub, would definitely come back again."
Great food and drinks,"Absolutely enjoyed my dinner here at The Drunken Poet!

Had a nice glass of Guiness that paired wonderfully with their Fish and Chips. The fish was cooked really well, an extremely crispy and flavourful crust which kept the fish inside moist and delicious. Their fries were also well done, and everything came together with the tartar sauce.

I loved the overall atmosphere of the place as well, and the staff were all really nice and friendly. Would definitely recommend!"
warm and cozy bar,"loved the rustic vibes here, super interesting ambience that felt really homely! really appreciated the very attentive service and recommendations, the food and drink pairing was yummy!! highly recoomended bar for a chill night out :)"
irish pub in sg!!,rly cute interior and irish pub vibe!! the service was super good w v attentive and friendly staff got the baby back ribs and lamb stew. chunks of lamb were tender and came w two pieces of bread (v nice!!). wish the portion was bigger and had more veggies/sides to go w it
Great Pub Grub,"Lovely place to grab a pint or two after work. Atmosphere was quite chill and was a nice respite from the busy streets outside.

Had the vodka-battered Fish N’ Chips, Truffle Battered Mushrooms, and Guinness Beef Pie. Heard that the Beef Pie was only available this month and it’s such a pity, it was so good! Generous portion of stew steeped with Guinness. The Fish N’ Chips tasted surprisingly light and fluffy, coated with crispy batter. Truffle Breaded Mushrooms were also great to pair with beer and are a nice alternative to the usual truffle fries. Definitely recommend this place if you’re in town!

Also, shout out to great service from Ivy!"
Poor breakfast.,Irish breakfast really quite poor. Mushrooms like bullets. Bacon crisped to death. And small Lived in Singapore for 8 years. Worst it’s been.
Irish bar in Orchard St.,"Irish bar in Orchard St. Promotion of 2 beers for $20 which is one of the cheapest beers in expensive Singapore. I also had the deep fried fish & chips. Huge plate & food was ok. All in all , a pleasant way to spend an hour or so. Staff were very attentive."
Decent place for a pint but food was awful!,"It's quaint little pub, decent beers and prices. The food was awful. Very disappointed. The staff were good though so that was a nice surprise."
Amazing.,"Words couldn't describe what was delivered beyond my expectations from this small cosy pub.
Group of 5.
Ordered pork ribs, fish & chips, 2 poets burger, traditional roast beef, 3 bits and bobs and all of us had a pint of Guinness!
Food was SPECTACULAR. And GUINNESS WAS TOP NOTCH! I recommend everyone who comes here do wait and try out their GUINNESS. Worth every second of waiting time as they do let our drink sit for few seconds before finish pouring in to fill up the pint. Damn Creamy GOODNESS!
I've read a few bad reviews from past the years.Seems like The Drunken Poet has up their game this pandemic year!
All 5 of us was just so happy and yes this is my 1st review after my 3rd visit.
My next will be trying out THEIR MONSTER BURGER! Saw a table who has preordered and I sneakily asked them how does it taste like. Well they were like, "" Order and try it. You won't believe how good this giant burger is till you taste it! No regrets!"".
NEXT!!"
Crazy hours and Great discounts on Eatigo!,"They have this 3-6 pm crazy hours promotion where you get two pints for 20+.

Booking on eatigo gives you the maximum discounts during the off peak period.

Fries are thick cut and crispy, freshly fried.

Fish is moist and not too oily.

Poet's burger has one of the best burger with a perfect blend of fried bacon, loads of fried onions, and a juicy beef patty

Service is swift and friendly.

This is just at Orchard towers, ground level, and you won't miss it. It's about ten steps away from Palais Renaissance mall. (opposite Forum the Shopping Mall)"
Sold out???,The place with the best Banger & Mash in Singapore and they run out??? This is very disappointing to allow to run out of your cash cow.
"Nice place,good food","It was very humid in Singapore and we were looking for somewhere to sit and have a cold beer,we found the ideal place where the food coming from the kitchen smelt really good so we sat and enjoyed our beer then ordered chicken and cheesy chips my partner had the Guinness pie everything was so tasty."
Nice Irish pub.,"Nice Irish pub. After a nice meal we had a mooch around before stopping for a swift beer. Busy, but fast service and a nice cocktail."
Bar like environment,"Ordered Poet’s burger and Pork ribs. With the eatigo 50% discount, the price for the burger would be $11. Poet’s burger tasted excellent and juicy. The ribs however was more on the smaller side. $25(actual price), I would expect a meatier/ bigger portion of ribs.

Pros:
Good food, good music

Cons:
The staff cleared everything including the cups right after we finish the meal. Felt like being ask to leave."
"Nice bar, Nice food","what a nice bar well look after by the staff watched the rugby, the beer was cold and the food was excellent. I tried the beef and Guinness pie and went back again before we left would recommend this ( order a bowl of chips to mop up the gravy) my wife had the nachos and said it was the best she has ever had.
The Singapore sling was excellent
Will visit on my next trip to Singapore"
Nice bar,"A nice place to have a beer, eat dinner at the bar and watch sport. Guiness and Kilkenny are found here in this quiet, airconditioned indoor bar."
yuck,Odd vibe for a pub... not great food or drinks. Just pass on this place not even the service is good.
Abysmal,The pototo cakes were tasteless lumps of starchy carbohydrates drenched in oil. The burger was terrible. The food was abysmal. Even the soy sauce wings were unremarkable and they were comparatively the best of the 3 orders.
Poor for an Irish pub,"Just passing we thought we would have a quick drink. Well a menu was presented. So we ask wine the was sold out so we had the local and I had the worst tiger beer in my life. We orders some nibbles that I couldn’t believe how bad it was tasteless and over cooked
Give it a miss"
Average pub,Stopped here for a drink and a few nibbles with some friends. The drinks were expensive and the cider on tap was a little flat. The food was ok. The ambiance was not bad and carried the Irish theme well
Great pub,"We popped in here for a quiet little drink and ended up playing the quiz. It’s free to enter and very good fun ! Staff are helpful. I had the fish and chips which were very tasty although I did miss the peas!!
We returned again for a second night although there was no quiz and it was much quieter but still a nice place to visit.
We recommend it."
Nice Food but Expensive,"Being a fusy eater, we decided to eat here one afternoon, Two fish and chips and two pints of larger - £45. It was nice but way too expensive"
Irish themed sports bar,"Not really a restaurant or full on Irish pub and not cheap but less costly than many bars along Orchard street, cosy, comfortable and friendly. Nice place to catch up with British sport."
Good sports venue,"4 x TV screens, two showing sport in the afternoon when we arrived here. Beers and wines a bit pricey, Sauvignon Blanc was not very good."
Expensive,Just had something to drink and eat here and it was very expensive. The food is average at best. Hard Rock Cafe round the corner much nicer and similar price if not cheaper. £15 GBP for 2 small beers... not even pints
Not an Irish pub,"Obviously was an Irish pub once. Nice locals pub done out in Irish style now. Menu does look authentic though with Irish and British pub classics on it. Footy and sports on here as well. Friendly lady front of house. Food good but some strange mixtures. Garlic bread served with all day breakfast, can do without garlic bread with my guiness stew as well. Good music soundtrack on speakers. Pub decorated for halloween, sorry dont do the occult or silly american stuff. Whats wrong with toast with your breakfast or normal bread with your stew? Garlic with pasta or other Italian foodstuffs. Tried deep fried spam fingers with mustard dip, delicious. Decor I suppose is Irish (ish) if you count pictures of men with orange beards and leprechaun hats on the mirrors, Galway road signs etc. Its a good replica but dont expect Christy Moore or the Sawdoctors"
TERRIBLE FOOD.,"TERRIBLE food & service. Don’t waste your money here, spend it else where. I brought my family to this Irish Pub because of the good reviews that I’ve seen. Service was very slow.
Truffle fries were just normal fries, when we brought the issue up, instead of re-frying, they poured oil on it. Chicken wings were NOT COOKED & RAW in the middle. When it came to mains, it was served COLD. Pork ribs were cold, and fish & chips filled with oil. Pork ribs were taken back & they just microwaved the same piece because it was just barely warm & tough by the time it came out again (other restaurants would have changed it for us) Not to forget, MOST OF THE THINGS WERE UNAVAILABLE at 1:30pm, no pizzas, no roasted chicken, and they even forgot one of our mains. We finished our mains while my father waited for 45mins for something that did not arrive in the end because they forgot. I would never recommend this place, poor service & terrible food."
Good food and open late,This place does pretty good pub food and is also open very late until 4am. It is right on Orchard Road so a good location.
Lousiest service!!!,"The pub was used to be awesome providing good service and food/drinks.
It has changed! The service guy rather sits at the bar eating his own food and watching soccer than servicing customers. You‘d need to walk to the bar to order ... or walk out the door again.

Food isn’t fresh prepared anymore as well, quality is gone down, too.

Worse then the food is the service!!! Pain in the ..."
