Nice place for brunch,"My favourite PS cafe outlet in Singapore. Located on top of Ang Siang Hill, in a quaint building with very tastefully decorated interior. We had the PS burger and Superfood salad. The beef patty was so flavourful and juicy, and the truffle shoestring fries were also very good. Highly recommended."
The P in PS CAFE stands for PERFECTION.,"Amazing staff! Safe distancing measures were followed strictly. Make sure you‚Äôre vaccinated! The hostess was really friendly and joyful. I requested a quiet table as I need to do work and she said she had a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù place for me.

It was upstairs and yes, it was really perfect! The manager was nice too. He keep checking up on me to ensure if everything was okay. Would definitely come back! All the staff was attentive and friendly."
Desserts,"Went for a dessert with a friend. We were there 10 mins before the last order, they reminded us nicely and yet still accepted us, which was awesome! Ordered a slice of banana cheese cake, enough slice for two, delicious! Sweet, but for once in a while treat I won‚Äôt mind :) The atmosphere of the cafe is nice. Really like the lilies arrangement at the entrance. The only complain was some parties were quite noisy near our table, which is not exactly the property‚Äôs doing (just some noisy customers), but just to give some pictures on the vibe from my experience. I‚Äôll come back some day."
Excellent team,Excellent serving team for my March 23 lunch visit. Manager Carlos and staff Eleanor provided top notch customer service. They took our small feedback seriously and gave assurance on continual improvement to their quality of food. Well managed service recovery.
Satisfied lunch,Food is nice.... service is superb!! Celestine really make us feel welcome and very prompt to our request and feedback. That‚Äôs the kind of service all is looking for. Will definitely be back for more!
A great find,Fantastic restoration effort. The original pressed metal ceilings and very wide timber window jambs all retain the initial character. Then there's the food! Ill be coming back just for the key lime pie.
Awesome Brunchü§òüèª,"One of my most fave places in SG. The food never fails us. Ordered the prawn pasta, Thai salad, mushroom soup, seafood basket & banana cake with ice cream. Divine desserts & awesome mains... truly a great afternoon brunch! Better to call up & reserve if u r heading there."
Brunch,Had brunch with wifey. She love the ambience and foods. Ordered classic benedict and big breakfast. Their service were amazing from the moment we enter and leave the restaurant. Worth to return again and again.
Absolute amazing service and beautiful ambience,"I went to the PS Cafe Ann Siang Hill branch with a friend for brunch and I had ordered one of the brunch mains. Unfortunately, the dish was not palatable to me possibly because I did not enjoy the taste of the oil used. I felt bad as I did not think I could continue eating the dish despite trying. So I asked our server, Elyn, if we could have the dish packed and order another dish. She then took the effort to probe and check what was wrong with the dish, to which I genuinely answered. Very surprisingly, she offered to switch the dish for me to something else with no extra charge. She also then went on to recommend to me a more popular dish. Clearly, she did not have an obligation to change the dish for me as it's my problem I wasn't a fan of the previous dish. But wowwww I was touched that she even came by to check what's my preferred spice level and if I had any dietary restrictions. She made a great recommendation as the new dish was tasty and flavourful with the right amount of spice for myself.
Overall, Elyn was a splendid, friendly host who really looked out for my friend and I to ensure we had an enjoyable experience even telling us that we should never suffer through bad food, and should like what we are eating to make sure the experience is a good one.

A big thank you to Elyn for being an amazing host."
Beautiful place for brunch,"Beautiful place for brunch and dinner. Always a big fan for their truffle fries. The staff, Toni was amazing. He is very observant and attentive. He pay attention to details. He is a star!"
Best service ever!,"Amazing service by Vicky, Khojie, Xuan and Mikael , Jo Food was good especially the Crab tart. Definitely will come back again."
Great staff,"Great staff named Toni. Very good customer service. Keep up the good work. Rustic ambiance, nice food."
The Warmth and Ambiance is at its Finest!,"As usual the ambiance is the main reason why I bring my friends over at PS Cafe. PS An Siang Hill is very cozy and private and the staff were pleasing and very warm. Tony is definitely passionate, very engaging and welcoming making sure that everything was ok and indeed it was. Their cakes were delectable and dont i cant stop munching on the truffle fries... its heaven in my mouth. Thanks Tony, we sure had a great PS experience as always!"
Unforgettable dinner on a usually forgettable day.,"Elvyn the waitress was so polite, passionate and sweet. She literally was the highlight of the night. Being usual patrons of ps cafe I have never been obliged to write a review as the food is well known to be good, the ambience amazing and the experience memorable.

However this time round I just felt compelled to because I really hope my humble review will encourage her and other passionate Waiters and Waitresses to continue doing what they love.

When a restaurant is known for their good food and impeccable dining experience, what boils down would be service. It will be the one that separates the good from the excellent.

Please always keep that smile and the passion to serve. Thank u for the wonderful night!"
I had an amazing birthday,I had an amazing birthday with my friends. Thanks to Kojie and his team for going all out on service and surprises..
Very Warm and Friendly Staff,Food and ambience was great. Kojie and the staff were very kind and customer oriented which made the whole dining experience great.
Gastronomic Experience,"The food was SUPERRRR, highly recommend the sticky dates pudding for dessert. The services were awesome, warm and friendly greeting since we entered the place, until we left. Thanks to Kohjie and his team for such wonderful dining experience!!!!"
"Great food, cozy ambience, & superb staff","P.S. Cafe is one of my go-to cafe/restaurant for sumptuous mains/ pasta, and delectable desserts.
I also like the cosy ambience and relaxed vibe that it brings everytime I dine here.

I recommend their Chicken Parmigiana for mains, Chicken Rossa Penne for pasta, sticky date pudding for dessert. Truffle fries as my all-time fave starter.

A big thanks to the staffs who made my dining experience wonderful. Thank you to Khojie and rest of the team for always being warm, friendly and attentive. You guys are great!

A pleasant experience and would definitely visit again."
Good Place to Hang out with Friends,"Me and my friends had and awesome time at P.S. Cafe @ Ann Siang Hill. We were looking for a cozy place to hang out and P.S Cafe had every category checked from great food, nice ambiance and pleasant staff. Kudos to Khojie and his team (Vicky / Josephine) for taking care of us while having our mini friend reunion. Will be celebrating occasions here again soon!!!! Enjoy the nice instagramable pics of food below!!"
Awesome Experience as always!,I would like to commend Vicky for remembering my name! My friends are so overwhelmed with the excelent service by Khojie and his team. Food are awesome specially the sticky date pudding! 5 Star Service! Kudos Khojie and the team!
An honest review,"Went there to celebrate a birthday with the missus, and we were served very well by the crew led by Sri, will definitely recommend asking for her as she knew her recommendations and was extremely professional. Even added a nice touch by wishing me happy birthday.

Ordered a sangria, truffle fries, crab tart, ps burger and red velvet cake.

Crab tart wasn‚Äôt the best as it tasted a bit fishy and was a weird combination of ingredients

The truffles fries and burger was really good, would recommend getting it.

Sangria and red velvet was also delightful, neither had too strong of a taste and it was a good end to a filling meal without making us feel sick."
Fantastic food and view. The,Fantastic food and view. The service is great. Look for Elyn! And it‚Äôs quiet where you can hang out with friends.
Happy to be lost here,"Very chill place. Had lovely flower arrangements. 3 floors of dining/drinking space with alfresco rooftop seating as well, though limited. Got perfect hot mocha, lovely moist cakes with heavenly ice cream and addictive truffle fries with finely shaved parmesan cheese (on the side). Service was polite, attentive & quick."
A Restaurant With Atmosphere,"This was our second visit to this black & white eatery. Amidst modern glass & steel towers that make up modern Singapore, it's colonial past peeps at us, visible in quiet neighbourhoods, in black & white cottages half hidden in the the lush equatorial landscape. One such home up on Ann Siang Hill has been converted into a modern restaurant which retains all the features of the the colonial black and white homes. The woodwork is all stained black, the tables are covered with white paper sheets that serve as table cloths, the floor tiles are faithful to the original.
We dropped in for lunch, and sat on the first floor which overlooks the tiled town houses that eventually became sky-scrapers in the background. We ordered the daily special, the roast chicken with onion sauce, fries and drank a basle orange soda. The portions were generous. The service was friendly, and quick, and smiling.
But what we missed was what they had during our previous visit - sharing plates. They used to previously have certain things on the Menu which could be shared ; like starters or tapas. These were gone from the menu. They are missed."
"Good food, great service","Waitress Elyn was particularly attentive and outgoing. Decent menu just slightly pricey. Great ambience, will definitely be back!"
Lovely ambience,"We had brunch here and all the food we ordered were pretty satisfying. We had their roast pork, egg benedict and portobello with eggs. Best to go before 12noon to avoid the crowd and try to make reservation for upstairs that has better view of the green surroundings."
Excellent,Very good ambience and good food. They have a variety of western and fusion food. Highly recommended.
Must visit,Excellent food n ambience .must visit. Great location.quiet n private .very warm n welcoming.friendly staff .interesting co concoctions
Great dinner experience,"Had a great dinner experience, thanks to our wonderful waitress, Tze Han. She was very nice and made the whole experience amazing. The food was great as well, except for the dessert we had, it was the fudgy brownie, which I felt the chocolate was too much for us. But overall still a great dinner experience and would return there again in the future"
Great dinner experience,great dinner experience. Tze Han was a good waitress :)))) enjoyed my dinner today. the team was very friendly as well :).
The best in trip ‚ô°‚ô°,"I came in here because the rainy. And this here make me full feel. I really like italian cherry soda. If you come to here i will recommend. And finally, the server is so nice"
The service of the staff,"went there for dinner with another 3 friends of mine, we had starters, main courses, desserts and 2
Bottles of wines on that night.
When I asked for 1 extra sauce to go with my fries, the waiter said 'is chargeable', seriously ??what a joke!!!! will definitely won't rush back to this restaurant again."
new brunch special menu!,"I‚Äôm back in Ps cafe here after 4 years and its amazing! They have a new brunch menu that serves tapas and small plates for sharing. We were served by Elise and she recommended such great food for us to share. Me and my friend ordered the Laksa, Fish Pie and Tomato Cheese Toast! The cheese toast is definitely the best of all. I really would come back again very soon. Not to mention the great customer service and christmas drink. Awesome!!"
Great night winding down after work,Our waitress Elyn provided us with great service & recommendations and had us in high spirits. Ended up spending 4 hours there and enjoyed our time thoroughly. Dessert was the best part. Also liked how the crowd was not too overwhelming.
P.S Cafe at Ann Siang Hill,Great ambience and service staff. I enjoyed the white sangria to the very last sip. Shoutout to Elyn for the hospitable service!
"Nice ambience, nice food",Elyn set us at a lovely table at 2nd floor for our lunch. We hv a special order for spicy king prawn aglio without the spiciness and a nice fresh proached chicken salad. Wegot our order right and thanks to the attentiveness of Elyn. This is our 4th time here but our 1st review.
Better than expected,"Reservations at PS Cafe Fullerton were full that night and it felt like ""oh well ok"" when I made dinner reservations at PS Ang Siang for 12 friends from six different countries who fly in to for a sales and marketing course at the Academy of Image Mastery.

Boy were we in for a nice surprise. Everyone loved the old world charm, good food and super excellent service!"
"Great food, Amazing service","We dined here on 8th of October, It was amazing, the staff are awesome and so friendly. Excellent service by our waitress Elyn, She's adorable and personable. The food was delicious! Great cocktails and shakes, even out of the menu, especially made by our friendly and nice bartender, Elaine. Exceptional food and service! Great team! Will definitely be back.."
Good food in Chinatown,"Great selection of salads/sandwiches, mains, and non-Chinese food. Full bar. Lovely building. Front door, and I believe most tables, require walking upstairs (if there was a lift I didn‚Äôt see it). I enjoyed miso cod main dish and a glass of wine. Great stop if you are walking in the Chinatown area."
Brunch,Excellent food for sharing . Loved the deserts. Truly enjoy our time there. Great service by Evelyn!
"Great food, awesome staff, prefect Ambience!","Great place for dinner or brunch with delicious mains and yummy desserts. Truffle fries is a must here and their drink list and daily special always 'wow' me! A really nice place for friends to gather, tourist to visit and do go to the roof top bar for a drink too."
Tiny sharing plates,"Been to PS cafe (various locations) many times as the food is consistently good and most of the time, service also. They changed their brunch menu to sharing plates recently it seemed. ""Over priced tiny plates"" is what I would call it. A bit disappointing as we are fans of the cafe!"
Business dinner,Ate here recently as part of a large group business dinner with food pre-ordered. Service was surprisingly great given the difficulties of dealing with a large group. Truffle fries were over-rated; rest of food was so-so. Key lime pie was the worst I have ever had: incredibly thick crust that couldn't even be cut and tasteless filling. Would definitely NOT recommend that.
Amazing service ! Thanks Elyn,"I visited Ann Siang branch twice with one week apart. In both occasions, I was served by Elyn. She was extremely kind, attentive, offered us some suggestions when the item we selected was not available. She checked if we needed anything else continuously. Definitely 10 star service. Thank you so much for having us. We will definitely come back again.
Try level 3 seats with low lighting and cosy interior"
Food was good as usual but service was horrible,"Had a mini wedding dinner there where the meals were pre-ordered.
The food was good as usual, however the service by the staff was terrible, which compromised the whole experience. None of the staff displayed basic serving etiquette.
One instance was everyone was served the soup with some of us left out, when we requested for our soup to be served, they insisted that all soup has been served.
The second instance was when the table was full with dishes, the waiter simply handed over the next dish into our hands and walked away, without aiding to move the other dishes away.

For anyone who is deciding to hold any events there, I suggest you reconsider as they clearly can‚Äôt even handle a group of 20 pax.
It was a total mess."
Dinner,"The dinner was amazing as always and I love the decor, jazz music and the atmosphere.
Elyn, our server, was really good at her recommendations especially the ginger pudding (which was amazing!) for dessert. Loved it! I would always recommend this place for its ambience and also, their food. Their specials are always worth it."
A beautiful meal and excellent servicd,"We were served by the delightful Vijay. He seated us in a perfect spot for our young baby, and gave us some great advice on the meals we had to try. The food was delicious - quintessentially Singaporean but also inventive and perfectly presented. PS Cafe is a must-visit when you‚Äôre in Chinatown."
Great Service,Jason was very attentive and his recommendations on the desserts were great! Our favorite was the Golden Banana Butterscotch Cake!
New Shared Plates Brunch Menu - Overpriced,"We visited the Ann Siang branch and were informed that they had recently changed their usual brunch fare to a ‚Äúshared plates‚Äù menu. While initially sceptical, we decided to give it a chance given PS Cafe‚Äôs good reputation build up over the years.

The service staff were extremely attentive (no complaints there) and repeated emphasized that the sharing plates were all served in very small portions and that we should therefore order more plates - perhaps to lower our expectations for when the food (or more accurately, the ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù) actually arrived on tiny plates and left us somwhat speechless.

The most disappointing plate was the Smashed Avocado Toast ($12) - admittedly, the description implies a single piece of toast, but when the toast is only the size of 2 EZ-link cards put together, and the avocado is very thinly spread (much less than the amount of kaya you would get on kaya toast for $1.80 at a local coffeeshop), it is hard to believe that the creators behind this new shared plates menu genuinely intended for the dish to be eaten by more than 1 person - but perhaps 2 toddlers could share though?

When running a business, it is certainly important to innovate and think of creative ways to attract new patrons and keep regular ones engaged. But sometimes, owners need to recognize and retain what already works for the business - people come to PS Cafe equally for the good food as well as the cosy and chill ambience, and it is generally acceptable that a slight premium will be charged for the latter. However, this sharing plates menu appears to be more of an attempted cash-grab at unsuspecting patrons and we certainly won‚Äôt be coming back for brunch with this new menu in effect. Thankfully the other PS Cafes have retained their existing menus."
Yummy,"Elyn and Jason provided excellent service, thoroughly enjoyed our time here. It made the food taste better than it already did."
Great service and atmosphere,Overwhelmed by the atmosphere and great service.I would like to compliment your staff Josephine for excellent service and patiently recommending on the foods and drinks.Thanks for the wonderful chat and will come back again to dine in.Five stars for PS Ang Siang Hill tooüòä
Fantastic service,Thanks for hosting us so well for brunch. Great service and suggestions. The fish pie was particularly great.
Flawless Service,"Absolutely brilliant venue, setting, ambience, menu and topped off by the amazing service from the entire team and notably from
Jason.

Beautiful menu, the Thai salad was a great starter and so many flavours. Loved the miso cod and the lamb and can‚Äôt wait to come back
with friends for more dishes. Great wine list, loved the champagne and give this place 10/10.
Please please add the English custard tart to the menu as it‚Äôs true perfection! Marcus Wareing would be proud!

We will return soon!"
Great Experience,I am having a dinner at Ann Siang Hill yesterday evening with my friend. I would like to thanks Josephine for her outstanding and exceptions customer service. Nice ambience and food. Sure will be back.
Friendly Barista!!!,The cafe has a cosy ambient and is a great place for catch up with friends to do small talks or do some casual reading etc. Barista Vicky was very friendly and we like her service! Thank you.
Good service,I would like to compliment on your staff name Josephine at Ann Siang Hill outlet . Josephine was very attentive and provide a good recommendation on the food which I couldn‚Äôt decide. She is very patient!:).
Great job!,"It was our first time in Singapore, me and my wife while exploring Chinatown, stumbled into a hidden gem. From the entrance, we were greeted by the friendly staff and incredible aroma of the fresh flora. The restaurant was filling up quickly but we managed to snag a table.
Swift service, the server (tall, bespectacled, unsure of his name) came over and offered us some drinks, in mere seconds, he came back with the drinks and tap water. While we refresh ourselves with iced teas while looking at the menu, a bubbly waitress took our order.
We had the harissa, sirloin and the paella. (My wife is loving those sharing plates!)
Overall experience, we were quite impressed in the level of service here,
good job on you guys!"
"Rude, Snobbish Staff",Reserved a table for 12 for my birthday celebrations. The waiting staff mostly on our level was just absolutely rude and condescending. I‚Äôm probably never going back there.
Always great food and service,"Stopped by for an early dinner and was very pleased with the great service, fast kitchen and good food. This is one of my favorite pplaces to go if I want to be certain to have a good experience and big filling meals. The caesar salad is huge and super tasty."
Great Experience,"Went for brunch at ps Ang siang hill and had a great time. Josephine, Alvin and David were so accommodating and helpful. It was a friends birthday and they even helped me with the candles and taking pictures. Thank you so much guys for this beautiful afternoon :)"

Amazing experience,Elyn was such a wonderful server! Very hospitable and friendly and went an extra mile to serve us the Snapper Chowder Pie.
Always great experience in PS Cafe,"My cousin and I had an impromptu dinner in PS cafe Ann Siang, where we got served by Josephine.

Josephine was very attentive and provided good recommendation on the food, especially for my cousin‚Äôs Mee Goreng.

I had Steak sandwich, which Josephine recommended it to have it medium. It came out very tasty and juicy."
"Amazing service, awesome food & refreshing ambience","Had dinner at PS Cafe' Ann Siang Hill last August 6, 2019 with my 2 sons. Cozy atmosphere on a Monday evening. We were served by an equally handsome, accomodating and funny guy by the name of Koji (I think he is the Manager). His recommendations were excellent especially the roasted chicken (forgot the exact name.. I think their daily special.) We had steak frites, truffle fries, buttermilk chicken (which is a bomb! Loved it!) and the pho noodles (again, I forgot the name!) Sticky date pudding with coffee to capped off our dinner date. Thanks to the warm service extended to us by Koji."
Good service,Visited the outlet for brunch . Nice comfortable ambience & Very courteous and friendly staff . Vijay was serving us and was wonderful and attentive . Food though took extremely Long to be served .
Great food and ambience. Tried the Impossible burger. Better than the meat equivalent.,"The pho was not as great but provided a decent meal. Our waiter Vijay was a lovely man, attentive and able to answer our questions."
Excellent Food & Service by Elyn,"The food was so great, I would highly recommend truffle fries, we cannot stop until the plate was empty.
For mains, we like Lamb Chop, Miso Cod and Beef Cheek Rendang, very tasty.

Elyn, is very kind and full of passion for her work, very knowledgeable and understand the meanu very well."

Great service offered by Elyn,"Loved the ambience and friendly services by elyn and another waitress. Good spread of food with interestingly fusion of ingredients. Enjoyed the huge portions of the ps burger, fusion crab spaghetti and sticky date. We took many lovely shots there too and it was a fantastic time together."
Awesome experience great ambience,"Had a wonderful brunch made better by cheerful Jason who served our table. We knew the quality staples like truffle fries & Choc door stop cake at this place & enjoyed the ambience. Jason gave us some great recommendations which we all love.

Perfect place for a catch up!,"Jio my buddy to ps cafe ann siang hill park, we were seated at the bar on the 3rd floor of the restaurant.

Why this place???
View from the rooftop terrace was spectacular, ideal for phototaking! Indoor seating at the bar lounge was cosy and relaxing. Food and drinks were delish. I particularly like the sweet and spicy combination of the madras margarita. It was so flavoursome! Not to forget, our server Elyn - she was absolutely superb. Elyn was so friendly and professional, we like the way she went into details about the specials, we were completely sold! Kudos girl! Thank you ps cafe for another amazing night :)"
Good service,Excellent location. Good service and food!amazing staff who catered to our every need. They also stock the impossible Burger which is a must try!
To compliment Elyn.,Elyn attended to us. She was very attentive to our needs and genuinely friendly and helpful. We had such a pleasant experience here because of Elyn. Very lucky to have her on your team.

The manager Jintong visit our table was very accommodating. The service staff jason give us excellent recommendations and enjoy the food that he recommended. The ambiance was lovely as you can see fresh flowers everywhere. We enjoy our lunch very much and will recommend this place to my friends. Thank you PS Cafe for the wonderful experience. See you again!!!"
Huge Error and Overpriced!,"If you order a vegetarian meal and you specifically ask for no meat and egg you really hope that the restaurant provides you with the correct meal. In this case the service staff clearly didn't communicate to the kitchen and being a vegetarian I ended up eating a few bites of chicken before I sent it back.

You'd think that a restaurant would apologize for these types of errors? One with great service would comp that meal given the grossly negligent error.

But as P.S. Cafe Ann Siang Hill they don't even apologize.

At the end, even to get our bill we had to ask 3 different waitstaff for it. I guess that's excusable as you're busy but still, not very professional.

When you pay $30++ for an entree you really expect reasonable care and service. Spend your money elsewhere is my advice.

Won't be back!"
Great,The food was amazing! We had the lunch menu and had breakfast sandwiches. The ambience is great and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Service was fast too. The drinks were also good. I had a mimosa and coffee.
Good dessert,Good service by Vijay! Awesome dessert - Chocolate cake & garlic bread. Nice atmosphere and cozy place at Ann Siang Hill. The best to chill up.
Good food good atmosphere,Awesome service by vijay Love the cakes here We always enjoy our time here during Friday night for happy hour
