Perfect experience,Fantastic views of Singapore in the evening. Our table was booked for 7.45pm it was busy but not unbearable.The Staff were friendly & helpful. We enjoyed some delicious food. We chose a few things & shared them between us. We had ribs & a burger which were really good.
A must visit experience both visually and culinary! And the staff will make you feel loved!,"This magnificent place is perched at the top and point of the marina sands. Sometimes places like this boast a great view but the food can be marginal. Not here! The food is fantastic! The staffs kindness and attentiveness make this a must do while in Singapore. We were only on the city for two days and we came here multiple times. We had The boneless chicken wings and calamari at the bar one night, and an extraordinary sit down dinner at the restaurant on another. For dinner It was mushrooms, tempura zucchini flower, sole, tomato bursts, and an amazing desert in the restaurant. They have a vast array of specialty cocktails and a view of the city that boggles the mind. Come here for sunset but make reservations. Hatta the manager made us feel like regulars even on our first visit, land Nancy our waitress took great care of us. Ask for her!"
That’s life,"Had after dinner drinks here when it finally stopped raining after a week. It was cool and breezy, rather nice evening outdoors. Drinks were ok and expectedly overpriced. Buzzy crowded ambience with a live dj"
Worst restaurant experience ever. What a waste of time. Such a shame as the location is simply amazing,"Worst restaurant I have ever visited. If I could rate the place less than 1 I would have. Cheap furniture, staff who are rushing to serve you, the size of the portions is a joke versus what they charge and certainly what they offer as beef tartare is meat cut into almost bite size raw meat pieces.

We expected a 5 star dining experience but the restaurant made us feel as being robbed.

It was raining and we had to sit indoors. However all doors were wide open and the air conditioning was trying to compensate the humidity. I wish I had my winter jacket with me. Felt like I was having dinner outdoors at a ski resort in the middle of winter rather than in Singapore. Not to mention the waste of energy and impact on climate change."
Jessica Mexico City,"We were just one night in Singapore before our cruise, we chose this restaurant and we're not disappointed with the food, staff or VIEWS! All the team CARE that you are having a great time. The place is full and all I see from guests on the tables around me is smiles. Towards the end of the evening Jessica, one of the managers popped across to be ABSOLUTELY sure we had a great, Jessica is from Mexico City and we love Mexico and the PeopleSoft Mexico, what a lovely lady and a great asset to the restaurant - see you all again and thank you for making our evening special"
A Must Do,"Had sundowners here with a few work colleagues. The view is of course spectacular. Pricey, and the min spend was meant to be 200 SGD per head but this wasn’t implemented. Pleasant staff. You have to do it once in your lifetime"
Worst service you can imagine,Worst Service at Sky-bar. Please check weather before you come here. Once it rains and stops you can forget getting any service. We were literally thrown out even after we had reservations. After the rain stopped cannot order anymore had to prove again that I am. Genuine guest and not a free loader to the waiters: Would not visit again here and do not recommend this place.
Disappointment,"We had very high expectations for Ce La Vi in Singapore, since our experience in Dubai’s Ce La Vi was amazing and memorable. Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed with the overall experience in Singapore. We were told to wait in the lounge for 45 minutes with the promise somebody would pick us up and take us to our table- that never happened and we almost missed our table reservation since the staff was extremely unhelpful since the beginning. Our table was extremely windy and when we asked the staff for a blanket because we were freezinng, they gave us napkins with the words that they do not have blankets there. I find that not having blankets on a rooftop restaurant mostly visited at night is outrageous and being rude, moreover, not even trying to solve that issue unacceptable. We were promised a table with a view, which we did not receive and the service was horrible- empty plates on our table the entire evening, we were being repeatedly ignored by the staff. Probably the worst thing was the food- it was mediocore, not seasoned well and simply, it did not taste good. Because our table was extremely windy (other tables had no wind) our food got cold in a few minutes, making it almost unedible. We received our steake knives when we were half-done with our meals and even with steak knives we were not able to cut the meat. Other guests sitting around us shared the same experience- they were very annoyed and even went to complain. I really do not reccomend this restaurant, it is a waste of money and time."
Wonderful time with breathtaking views,Since the moment we planned the trip to Singapore I wanted to visit the famous Marina Bay Sands building and see the view from the top. We had reservations for yesterday evening and I have to say it was an amazing experience. Great time with the family with drinks and appetizers. The view was breathtaking! Glad to have experienced this on this occasion with family and during the festive season.
Avoid this restaurant,"Very limited menu. The food is simply bad and service is subpar. Can’t count on the view because if it rains any time during the day, they use it as an excuse to sit everyone inside. The only thing resembling fine dining is the price!"
"Mediocre Food, Go Elsewhere","We went for Sunday brunch and the website is misleading in that a minimum spend of 78 per person for a non-alcoholic brunch led me to assume that price would be inclusive of food. We essentially paid over 150 dollars for two soft drinks — absurd even by Singapore standards. We also ordered a sushi platter and a variety of sharing plates — all of which were mediocre at best. Perhaps most upsetting was that when my sister explained that she has a serious food allergy and asked to confirm it was not in any of the dishes we ordered, not a single waiter returned to confirm that was the case. We were so disappointed that we left in under 30 minutes. Definitely our worst experience in Singapore. If you want to see the view, just go up to the observation deck instead!"
Very nice,"We could not get in touch with Ce La Vie on WhatsApp (even at a very quiet day and time) - so you have to do walk-in and hope for the best.

We walked in (after not having passport for the casino which they are strict with, a photo of it or a driving licence is not sufficient) at 530pm and managed to get a seat at the edge, and orderede 1 expensive drink to wait until 7pm for the light show (it is better to view at ground level!!).

Nice ambience for chilling for 2 hours."
"Good experience , but no for ""solo"" traveling.","Is very good, the drinks were good, good staff and very nice atmosphere. The view is good, but in my case , I did a mistake, more than dininig , I was looking for the view, which is not bad, but for me the observation deck would have worked better, I was at the counter, so basically who can enjoy the view are the people that have tables, but as I said, that was my mistake, that I did not check well."
An excellent night out at this restaurant and rooftop bar,"Yes, it's expensive but worth the money for a truely amazing experience. Excellent food, cocktails and an amazing view. A once in a lift time experience!"
What a lovely night!,"Pre booked online around three weeks ago. Easy access, table waiting, excellent service, nice drinks, fabulous view, good atmosphere. 3 beer, 3 wine and 2 Diet Coke cost £92.00. A bit pricey but worth every penny!"
"Amazing restaurant, fantastic views great service","Amazing restaurant, fantastic views from the 57th floor, delicious food. Great service from Manon and the team. Definitely recommend this restaurant."
Spectacular view,Drinks are pricey 1oz of liquor only. Being from NY very used to 1 1/2 oz per drink. Kinda spoiled I guess Snacks are average. Go for the views only!
A disappointing experience,"Service was slow. After menus delivered sat for at least 15 minutes before wait staff attended for our order. Took 45 minutes for our main to arrive. Sadly the prawns were almost cold when they arrived and the cauliflower dish was not much better. Not good.

Disappointing for a restaurant in such a setting."
The Ce La Vi Hawker Centre,"On the positive side the food was excellent and when it wasn't raining the views where brilliant but the issue is that they are a fining timing establishment who thinks they are part of a hawker centre!

On the night we went it was pouring with rain so the outside tables were closed. We were seated beside a table they were using to stack dirty dishes before taking them to the kitchen.

We assumed this was a temporary arrangement due to the weather but by the end of our meal the constant stream of waiters adding dirty dishes to the table, dropping dirty cutlery etc on the floor and carrying the full trays away was ridiculous.

When we finally complained to the manager he didn't seem to think this was a problem and struggled to even deal adequately with our complaint.

I think if you a lucky enough to get a table, get the correct food and drink (we received two incorrect orders for another table) you can have a fantastic time. However it is meant to be to be one of the top restaurants in Singapore so I expect them to actually think about the customer experience and not what is easier for themselves.

Even Singapore hawker centres try to keep the dirty plates away from the tables so for a restaurant to present a $600 bill for our meal and seem to think having dirty plates right beside customers, with a constant stream of waiters dropping off more, is acceptable they are seriously in the wrong business."
Amazing view,"Super famous due to its stunning view, Ce La Vi is pretty much a must visit bar/restaurant when in Singapore. It's pricey and a bit overpriced actually but one has to pay for the view I guess. The terrace is the perfect place to enjoy the weather and city views, either with dinner or drinks. We had drinks and snacks and an amazing time."
Fabulous views,We made a reservation for drinks and took in the views from the top of the hotel. The drinks were excellent and the appetizers we had were very tasty.
Nice drinks,We had came here after along day sightseeing. We were shown to our table and waiter came with menu both food and drink ... we had exceptional service from start to finish. We ordered something small to nibble on sliders.. recommend very tasty. Drinks came down garnished and presented very well ... the lights dimmed and it definitely nice chill out time after a long day
Stunning stunning views and service,"The food was pretty decent and service was extraordinary by the gentleman “Mannan” who made our evening very special especially with family visiting from the UK.

Mannan’s service is quite a rare find in Singers and if all restaurants had more staff like him, am sure they’ll have fab reviews and regulars like us.

Thank you so much again Mannan x

Ps. Don’t bother with Smoke and Mirrors bar, it’s just awful in comparison"
Dinner with mates,"Fantastic meal, with the best views of Singapore well worth a visit when in town, excellent service from amazing staff."
Mannan - Mr Fai-Vera BEST SERVICE AND VERY ATTENTIVE,"Mannan was very attentive and ensured we had a great night. Nothing is was too much to ask and everything was done with a smile. The bar tender also went out of his way, he came to our table to ask feedback on our drinks!!"
"Chaotic, Expensive & Mentally Exhausting “Experience”","My son and I visited this restaurant and bar, for the bottomless brunch, as part of F1 trip to Singapore.

We were so looking forward to visiting Ce La Vie but it was a disaster from start to finish.

We had a reservation and had to queue downstairs to get in. Not a major problem but staff kept coming along and moving the queue around. Got upstairs eventually and 15 minutes of our allotted time had already gone!

Then mass confusion reigned. The first 4 drinks we ordered all went to the wrong tables leaving us with nothing nearly 45 minutes in. Lots of arm waving later and some degree of “service” was delivered.

Some of the orders were wrong but hey, at least for very premium prices something was delivered.

The end of the time slot was very rushed and then the bill arrived. It bore no resemblance to what we had ordered. Bearing in mind this was a fixed price Brunch, you paid extra for food, the food items we ordered were all overcharged.

We were informed we could then go and sit at the outside bar and “enjoy the view”. We paid for 2 beers, sat down and were immediately asked to leave as we didn’t have a reservation! Security arrived and ushered us away from our paid for beer. They were quite aggressive and we were just sat there quietly minding our own business.

So, for around GBP 400, this was the worst “Premium” experience I have ever sampled.

Needless to say we won’t be back as chaos was the order of the day with downright rudeness thrown in to top the afternoon off.

I was, actually, relieved to leave!!"
A place to avoid. Go to KOMA or Mott32 instead,"When I travel, I don't do museum. I do food. While this place was a return trip from pre-covid days, it will be my last time. They used to have tables outside, you now have a better view if you went there for a drink.
The service was the most off-putting thing I have encountered in a restaurant that charges a fortune.
We were there for two hours:
15 minutes to get our menu.
Another 25 minutes for our entree.
Another 45 minutes for our main.
The manager came by to ask us whether we enjoyed our main, and I told him: ""What main? You guys have forgotten our main.""
By the way, our lettuce and avocado salad came without avocado.
People on both sides of the table were complaining as well. We managed to laugh about it.
Like them, we left without the dessert.
TERRIBLE SERVICE, NO VIEW, INCOMPETENT MANAGEMENT.
How the hell does Marina Bay Sands put up with them?"
Not as good as the view,"Having visited a week earlier and had an awesome time I was excited to return.
As it looked like rain I asked if I could possibly move to a table under an umbrella … this was met with a sigh and much discussion from staff. I was moved to a table wedged between to other large tables - still no umbrella coverage.
About 45min later I was asked if I would like to move to a high table at the end near the observation deck, I thought this is nice but alas it was because they needed my table for a bigger group…. Anyway I got rained on, (I get they can’t control the weather)
It was as though focus was on high value groups not a solo guy what managed to spend 150.

It soured what was a previous good experience"
Pretty people non-existent service,"If u wanna see good looking people and you have 1K or more for a table reservation, good for you. Otherwise don’t bother. My brother and I finished one bottle at the bar,and were looking to order one more. After 45 mins of TRYING TO ORDER, we got one bartender - the one with the gold hair - to notice us and he just rolled his eyes. Never came back to follow up. Basically we waited 45 mins and none took our order, so we left. Forget this place find somewhere else"
Amazing experience!,"I turned up without a reservation on a perfect Saturday lunchtime. I was whisked up to an incredible table with one of the most amazing views I've seen.

As I was there during their 'brunch service', I paid a flat free of SGD 120ish for unlimited free flow drinks and then ordered lobster roles and fried chicken bites from their separate food menu.

The food was incredible, the service flawless (thank you Sadique!), the view spectacular, and the experience priceless. What an amazing way to spend a few hours in Singapore on a beautiful day. Make sure you do this (but, unlike me, book in advance!)."
Birthday Celebration 🍾,Such a unique place to chill - perfect for friends party time 🥳 . It is also a best place to have a date dancing with the latest club music.
Great vibe great food great service!,"非常滿意這次的經驗
與家人慶祝父親節 這邊的食物好到令人驚艷
氣氛很好 風景宜人
服務甚好 有了很好的經驗！
以後還會再訪！
Having lot of fun with may family here! Celebrating father’s day here and the food is great, with great view and service.
Specially thanks to our waiter Nawnn ! Thanks for your kind service!
Will definitely come again with my friends!"
A very welcoming and friendly staff,"Great afternoon there The drinks and food were delicious. Especially, the service from our waiter Red was excellent. She was really friendly, smiling and making sure everything was fine for all of us. I totally recommend her to make your moment there amazing :)"
Double Birthday Celebration,"Ce La Vi is worth every penny! My nephew and I had our double birthday celebration and it was a blast! The food is great and service is commendable. Special thanks and shout out to Madeleine who have made our dining experience extra special!

I Can’t wait to return and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Ce La Vie to anyone looking for a place to dine and celebrate!"
60th Birthday Disappointment,"My children had booked this surprise visit for sunset drinks overlooking the bay for my 60th birthday having pre-booked. The view is stunning, but not worth the visit. There is a free viewing platform elsewhere. We were tucked away near the side bar next to the pool with boxes of stuff at the side, not the visual experience I was expecting a bit untidy really! The wine was shockingly bad and the service was poor. I felt as if this was a real tourist trap and it didn't matter to the staff about retaining customers because many would never return. I really couldn't recommend this bar. The booking stated it was a special birthday and when we asked for the bill it arrived with a cake, they couldn't find the lighter and it was all an after thought. This wasn't cheap visit and not good value or great experience. There are so many lovely bars/restaurants in Singapore, sadly not this one."
The good experience,Thank you for everything . the food is amazing I love the atmosphere the place is incredible is beautiful the view os amazing
"Pleasant restaurant, excellent view, nice food","This is my second time to visit the roof top of Marina Bay Sands. The view is stunning as usual. I think this is one of the nicest views in Singapore. For the restaurant, this is my first time to visit. The restaurant gave me a very pleasant feeling, the seating is very comfortable, and most of the guest will be able to have a nice view of the Marina Bay. Food is very nice! Pricing is reasonable for this class of restaurant. For me, I would suggest visitors to book the restaurant's bar and lounge in case the restaurant is full. Overall, I would recommend to everyone who would like to visit Singapore."
Average drinks but fantastic view,"The view here, needless to say is really fantastic. The lady that served us was also very nice. There were 6 of us. We ordered food and drinks and we got our food first and we were half way through our meal before we got our drinks and not all our drinks either. It wasn't worth 25SGD a drink, there was seriously nothing special. It started to rain a little, and those umbrellas don't really cover you and there's no where to go when it starts to rain. Luckily it stopped. I guess we go there for the view and not for the drink. But then we could have just gone to the observatory deck!"
Magical evening,"Magical evening at Ce La Vi. All of the staff was incredibly attentive. We sat outside and asked if we could move to a corner table, and they tried hard to accommodate the request (and succeeded!). The food was simple but delicious and well prepared. The cocktails were great. Overall a lovely experience, and wouldn’t hesitate to return!"
A bad experience,"Had a bad experience. Started by coming 10 earlier, the host couldn’t get us to bar lounge before our official time of reservation so we had were walking around the hotel (the place was half empty when we came), got the seats that we didn’t reserve (the host told us to wait it out), got a side table that was dirty before sitting us down, not something you expect but here you go. We had a good time as a family but not thanks to the their hosting."
Hectic and smoke-filled,"We understand that nicotine addicts need their fill, but this was not a good experience for us. This is the only place we visited in Singapore where cigarette smoke annoyed us. Pricey and loud, but OK otherwise."
Disappointing everything,"The first thing they did was to remind us that we have only 2 hours. One drink and one food menu for 4 people. The view was great. The food was ok, but for the price it should have been better than ok. The waiter brought the desert platter and ""told"" us to do a video. The big deal was that he was pouring liquid nytrogen into a cup...the stuff inside wasn't even edible. We had to ask for service since they disapper and seem to be understaffed. The margarita was served in the same glass as the water, for which we had to ask twice. It had only the flavor of cheap tequila. No fresh lime, no orange flavor. The cocktails were watered down from too much ice. The Singapore Sling tasted like cough syrup! No balance. I guess they have too much ""supply"" of reservations and they don't need to do better. Too bad!"
Beautiful place on top of Marina Bay sands.,"This is a very nice restaurant on top of Marina Bay Sands. The view of the Bay Area and the Gardens of the bay is very beautiful from the top.
The ambience of the place is very nice and the staff is very cooperative.
Though the choice if menu is very less and the vegetarian even less.
It was very sweet of the Chef to make a very nice dessert for us."
Fantastic view!,"Fantastic views from the bar, drinks expensive but reflect the great service compensate for the great views and ambience."
Standards have significantly slipped,"My 7th trip to Ce La Vi will be my last. Pathetically slow service, overcharged by $130 (whoops sorry for adding the adjacent table’s bill to yours) and only half reasonable food - the old highlight of spicy corn soup being no longer on the menu.

Skip the dry Iberico pork and be ready to be regularly calling out for service when none is made available. Put simply, the restaurant is either understaffed or, more likely, adequately staffed with the wrong people (it did seem that only 2 of the waitstaff in the entire restaurant were capable of taking an order at 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon). To to be clear, the issues we encountered were not just random bad luck (eg a random poor waiter), but systemic customer service issues which won’t change unless the restaurant makes changes to their staffing and approach.

For an “iconic” location, pre-COVID (and to be fair even in late 2021) this was a place to go and the service was at a reasonable level. However, now I wouldn’t recommend eating here based on the quality of the service the restaurant now provides. It is disappointing as it is such an amazing location, but memories of lunch will not be related to the view or the ambiance but rather the pathetic service."
We felt let down.,"We will not be dining here again and would urge others to reconsider before making a reservation.

My friend and I were staying at the Marina Bay Sands and were looking forward to our dinner at the CÉ LA VI. We were celebrating an occasion we had let them know about in advance and were expecting a special, personal evening whilst looking over the beautiful views of Singapore.

Oh how wrong we were.

Having experienced fine dining around the world from luxury hotels such as the Mandarin Oriental and Four Seasons; not unreasonably there is a certain standard of service and etiquette expected. The CÉ LA VI fell spectacularly short on both counts.

On arrival we were informed by way of greeting we needed to ensure that we had left our table after the 2 hour mark, “in time for the next reservation”. It felt impersonal and abrupt.

We were shown to our table and left by the waiter. We sat down and made ourselves comfortable. Later on two menus were dumped on the table. Not handed to us. One menu each right? No. It was one food and one drinks menu which we had to share between us. Very peculiar.

We asked if it would be possible to move to a table with a better view as we were in the centre of the restaurant. After a few minutes we were told that there was only one table available in the bar area. We agreed to the move. We thought they would move our drinks for us to the new table. Surely this was not unreasonable to expect at a high end restaurant? But no, we were asked to move with our drinks and other items to the table.

On sitting down, we were told by a new Waiter that the table was actually only available for 45 minutes. The waiter did not tell us this in a formal or apologetic way. He was clarifying over his earphone/mouthpiece whilst talking to us that the table was indeed only available for 45 minutes. We decided to move back. Obviously we moved our drinks by ourselves. On returning to the restaurant there was no apology for the inconvenience caused to us, only a joking, “you’re back again!” from a waiter.

At times throughout the meal we needed to talk to a waiter/waitress whether it be for drinks or to order food. It was very hard to attract attention and at times we felt we were being deliberately ignored.

At the end of the meal we asked for the bill. A waitress hurriedly handed it to us and we paid. She briskly handed us the receipt and walked away. No, “thank you for dining with us”, no, “we hope you had a wonderful evening”. We just sat there and thought, “is that it?”. We left the restaurant and felt thoroughly dispirited by the whole evenings events.

What is more, we thought there would be some mention of our special occasion or celebratory dessert. On both counts we were disappointed.

What an inadequate evening in every regard. Clearly because of this restaurants location they feel they don’t have to try hard. The reality was we could have been anywhere as we had a poor view from our table in the centre of the restaurant. What we were left with was extremely poor service and mediocre food."
Disappointing.,"We were really looking forward to having an amazing dinner on the rooftop at this restaurant, and we had read good things. We understand it’s a high-end restaurant so we expected a high-end experience. After having worked in hospitality myself, I understand how difficult it can be to please everyone. However the service from the beginning was very impersonal, and we expected a lot more for the prices that we were paying. Food quality wasn’t even that impressive, portions were small, and it was hard to get the attention of the staff so we were waiting around a lot. We felt that it was very audacious to charge us 10% for service when we barely interacted with anyone! Wouldn’t recommend at all."
"CE LA VI, SINGAPORE","This restaurant being rated 4-5 stars and Very Popular with Tourists. The TOP Selling point for this restaurant is LOCATION. The restaurant sits on top of Marina Sands Building, easy access via All forms of transport. The View is Very Good especially during the evening/night. The Food is acceptable; so is the service. The ambience is Good, and BAR well stocked. Prices are in line with most 4-5 stars outlets in Singapore. Plan visit during evening and Enjoy the Good views !!"
Amazing dinner for celebration,"Last night my hubby and I brought our daughter to Ce La Vi to celebrate her high school graduation. The team at Ce La Vi went above and beyond to make it special for her. The food was absolutely amazing. I had the lamb and my husband had the sole. Both were fantastic. We had foix gras lollipops for an appetizer- very good and so cool! Our server, Madeline, gave us the best service we have ever had in seven years in Singapore. They surprised our girl with a congratulatory chocolate dessert and bubbly for us all! Took pictures for us and just made her feel special - all unasked for. I can’t recommend them enough. All of this with an unparalleled view of Marina Bay and surroundings. Fantastic!"
Mesmerising,"In my innumerable visits to Singapore, many of my acquaintances have recommended Cé La Vi as the definitive dining destination in the city. To my utmost delight, my expectations were exceeded beyond measure. From the warm hospitality to the luscious food amidst spectacular views of the city, I was thoroughly enthralled. If you are in town, an evening at Cé La Vie should be on your list."
Nice views but service was slow,The views from the top are great and you should try to get there for sunset. The food inside the restaurant was good however the service was very slow.
Excellent foods,"Excellent foods & atmosphere. Especially the lamb, fantastic! love the atmosphere . As pretty crowded, but staff still serving well will definitely return"
Great service in the restaurant,"I went with the bunch of family and kids. They did try to accommodate to their best ability which is what is expected from a restaurant. They could improve to have a small kids menu at the inside restaurant side I understand the bar side might not have kids .
All in all good and the restaurant was accommodating .look forward to visiting again.
Food was good although the selection was limited."
Mother’s Day celebration 8may,"Nice place for dinings…service staff very attentive.Food , drink’s especially at skybar is good.Went to celebrate Mother’s Day on 8may….view Singapore at top 57floor is awesome ."
Poor customer service,"Went for a drink in the evening, supposed to have reservations done by one of the hostess earlier, but then instead I have to deal with rude, unprofessional guy with attitude who act like owning the place, Shame, didn't expect such a customer survice in place like that and waste the evening, was too late for ather place."
"Excellent venue to watch the sunset and enjoy the skyline of Singapore. Drinks, service and views are great",It is a great place to have drinks and enjoy the sunset. Make sure to have reservations. Try to be there earlier to watch the sunset.
"Decent food, condescending concierge","My husband had booked a table with a view at this 57th floor restaurant of MBS as a birthday treat for me.

Sadly from the get go, this turned out to be one of those over hyped experiences that build expectations but end up being disappointing in reality.

When we reached the entrance, the concierge was missing and there was
a queue. Took a bit of time for the concierge to show up, and attend to the guests waiting.

When we were shown our table outdoors, we discovered it was one of the back tables and my husband asked if we could have one of the sofas at the front since he had specifically asked for a table with a great view and had booked about a month in advance.
The concierge checked and told us tables were booked out. Had she stopped there, it would have been just disappointing but understandable.

But then she proceeded to inform us that those tables at the front are reserved only for guests who can guarantee a minimum spend. My husband told them when he booked, there was no such instruction on the website, but she repeated this - those tables are only for people who can guarantee a certain spend.

Not only was this never mentioned anywhere; the way this was delivered was extremely rude, condescending and discriminatory. Clearly we didn’t come across as people who met their exacting affordability criteria!

Anyways we decided to not ruin our evening, so we proceeded to order and eat our dinner and leave.

The food we ordered was quite good and our server was quite helpful & attentive.
We are both teetotallers so the choice of beverages was limited. One of the rattan chairs we had was frayed and we had to ask for it to be replaced.

My only advise - instead of focusing on standards of affordability for its guests, the lounge could do well to focus on improving the attitude of its staff and paying attention to these missing details that you do not expect from a place as iconic as MBS.
As far as I am concerned, I will never be going back to a place that judges me on my affordability!"
A toast among the clouds,"Efficient service, a great view, interesting cocktails and dessert and honestly, it's c'est la vie👌 😃."
Angry staff,We went 10pm today for drinks. The reception down accepted us as walk in. But the reception at 57 floor was so angry. Talking with her Filipino language with her Filipino colleague scolding the reception down why they accepted walk inn. She can’t recognised me that I am a Filipino too that I can understand that she was not happy with us coming at 10pm. And the Filipino guy said it’s ok they will seat us at the bar counter. And she made face.
Disappointing!,"My friends arranged for a dinner session there for my birthday celebration. When we arrived, the service crew was busy shifting guests to other seating area due to the potential incoming rain and thus we were kept waiting for a while before we were finally shown a table for 6. We were told that we have 2 hours dining duration which is fine given the circumstances nowadays and limited seating capacity. We ordered most of our food from the Sunday BBQ menu - a Feast Patter, Fremantle Octopus, Truffles Fries, an extra set of Charred Broccolini and a steak which I cannot remember if it is the Miyazaki striploin or New Zealand ribeye, a bottle of Penfold Resling and Penfold Shiraz Cabernet. And while we were waiting, we saw service crew carrying the outdoor seat cushions across the dining area and bar (which was busy with people eating and drinking) so that the cushions did not ended up being wet due to the rain.

- The food arrived almost an hour late.
- The charred broccolini on the feast platter tasted cold compared to the extra set that was ordered.
- Since there was a 2 hour dining duration, we were in a rush to finish the food.
- The steak never came.
- When we wanted to order a second bottle of wine, we were told that we only have 5 minutes left."
Book well in advance for this!,"Obviously an absolutely stunning view of Singapore! But more than that, the food was amazing and the service was really fabulous, awesome staff :) Overall everything had a great vibe :) :)"
Always impresses,"It will certainly give the wow factor when you have guests in town.

The view is amazing, service is exceptional and the bar food is pretty good.

Well worth a visit.

Currently you can only book 2hr slots like many places."
Great Ambience and Amazing views,Must a one time try as roop top view of Opposite Marina is beautiful and great ambience. We had a great time and good food. Great service by staff.
Breathtaking Views of Singapore!,Ce La Vi is one of the restaurants on top of the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. It is buzzy and fun but the USP is the breathtaking views of Singapore. There are observation decks just below but why not enjoy a drink and food whilst admiring the view!
Definitely be back!,Food and ambience was tip top especially the pork bun and dessert platter (sorbet was my top1 fav) ! Can't wait to go again in Apr for their newly revamp menu by their new head chef Max!
Awesome experience,"We had an amazing time and we’re fortunate enough that the general manager of Ce La Vi offered us a private tour. The views are amazing, the service top is notch and the cocktails mouth watering. Food was great as well!"
Wonderful birthday surprise,"It has been fantastic, to host a surprise birthday celebration for a friend. The service standard, the food, the view, everything is so wonderful and I am glad my friend has a great day, having great fun at Ce La Vi. The staffs are very thoughtful, cool and attentive. I highly recommend any tourist that Ce La Vi is a must come visit place. For locals, come and chill out here. Its a great wonderful experience that you cannot forget the great experience."
"great night view, food, and service","Great experience for a Sunder dinner.
We ordered red snapper, red curry, truffle fries, and chicken wings. All dishes were delicious and fresh! The night view was also amazing, for sure it is one of best roof top dining experience i've ever had!"
Good Sunday Brunch,"Great experience for the Sunday Brunch. Everything seemed well organised and efficient service. Good quality and tasty food.

Vera and the team went the extra mile to support our last minute requests for a Birthday platter. Executed well and attentive service."
superb,"its the roof top bar of the marina hotel, entrance coast 25 euros and get up from the alevator on the lobby. u can join either you do not stay at the hotel.no swimming pool view from there tho, but great view of finance center of the city."
"Poor meal, poor experience","Went here last night for a belated valentine's meal. I'll just list out the issues which you should not expect from a $250 meal.
- 15 minute standing in a queue as our reserved table was not ready at the designated time
- waitress quite flustered, wrote order on a scrap of paper, inevitably forgot something
- two cocktails, not great, put on a recently vacated table for 5 minutes in eyeline before being given to us. Watery.
- sparkling water - not chilled
- wagyu tartar - forgotten, when reminded at end of the meal given for free (thanks), but initially blamed us for not ordering it until reminded waitress that she asked us the options for big or small portion. Ohhh. Chewy... Not the best beef for a tartar really as full of fat.
- Korean chicken wings - nice
- smoked ribs - nice
- burrata - recently taken out of fridge, not creamy, quite hard
- 20 mins later once we'd eaten everything else, signature pork chop arrived, this is a $55 dollar dish. It was well overcooked, dry, grissly, not nice.

All in all poor experience. The view is there I guess, but for the cost you expect fine dining, not a subpar, poorly cooked meal with substandard and inattentive service."
"Nice views, nice food and nice service",We can enjoy views outside the restaurant for bird's eye view along the marina bay skyline. The staff acceded to the requests promptly. Will recommend for another visit next time
Family dinner,"Great evening. Lovely food, friendly staff and wonderful views. Would certainly recommend. Look forward to a return trip."
Ce la vie defines service!!,"The best part of the Rooftop Bar at Ce La Vie was the person who greeted us in the lobby …. that was the last real interaction we had until he said goodnight after we left.

Our last night is Singapore and the worst service we have received.

First and foremost this is a beautiful spot with a magnificent view .. no question. But the atmosphere is diminished by the unenthusiastic, disinterested staff.

You are given a two hour window, which is fine, but I would think staff would want you to consume a good amount in that time. So if you put aside the fact that this is a high priced choice, we had to get up to find a staff member to order food, and later a second round of drinks.

We didn’t stay for the full two hours!! And not even a thank you for coming as we waited at the lifts in front of three staff members when we left!!

I cannot speak to the restaurant, but having enjoyed Lavo a couple of nights before, both the bar and the restaurant at Lavo are a far superior choice by a long stretch.

Singapore has a lot to offer, and the view at Ce La Vie is not enough if we they want to retain the high standards of service Singapore has provided on our stay."
Great view!,"The view was great. The food was that good. From the cocktails list, i have tried atleast 4 and i only enjoyed 1 ( It’s called yuzito). I guess we’re paying for the view."
They charged me even though I cancelled and even though I was a regular customer. No more.,"They charged me even though I cancelled and even though I was a regular customer. No more.

They gained $50 for apparently not turning up even though I explained that I had cancelled on line 2 weeks before but they have now lost tens of thousands of dollars in lost customer revenue.

They effectively have called me a liar.

The fact that Jess and Arian actually argued with me and were adamant that I had to pay a $50 fine regardless of being at the venue 3x in the last month means that now they have lost all my goodwill, all my recommendations and tens of thousands of dollars in future revenue.

There are plenty of other rooftop bars in Singapore without this arrogant attitude.

Also it's probably the worst brunch in Singapore as you don't get any food just drinks and every other bar and restaurant do both.

Plenty of other great brunches in Singapore. DM for recommendations, avoid C'Est La Vie."
Terrible service,"Had a dinner for 4 on the 22nd of Jan. Food was pretty good, but the service was atrocious.

Our reservation was from 5.30pm - 7.30pm, but we constanly felt like we were being rushed the moment we started eating. The waiters and even the manager were constantly butting in to clear every single plate that was freed up, 1 by 1, and it seemed like we were the only table to be targeted in this way, possibly due to us being seated at a 5-seater table, or having a table with good view.

Some context; we ordered about $700 worth of food, some mains and a bunch of small plates + steaks to share. Even when there was still steak left in the center of the table, they wanted to clear our individual eating plates when they were empty but we were not even done, just chilling before grabbing another piece. With the amount of food we had, this really happened a considerable amount of times, so much so that all of us felt we could not even enjoy the atmosphere and view of dining on top of MBS, as we constantly felt rushed and couldn't even chill or have a proper conversation. By 7pm, our table was already fully cleared.

After making payment, i asked to speak with the manager, and a manager by the name of Calvin (didn't even introduce himself, had to ask a waitress after the fact) came to speak to us. My idea was just to feedback to him about how we felt throughout the dinner service, but he was very defensive and all he said was ""but this is how we do things here"" , which he said another 3 times after i tried reiterating about the poor customer experience. Also, we had doubts about his claims because the other tables around us were not being cleared as often; a table across from us who seated at the exact same time, had empty plates sitting on their table from 7pm all the way till we left at 7.20pm.

One would expect expect exemplary service from a restaurant being housed in MBS, while also forking out a pretty penny, but the service completely ruined the experience. Please better train your manager Calvin in basic customer service. Seems like the only thing he knows how to do at the moment is clear plates and not be receptive to feedback."
CE LA VI,"This is an experience not to be missed.
You will need to book to get a seat and it maybe wise to book even before you fly to ensure a seat.
There is a fixed price of a min $150 pp. Not hard to get to and with drinks we were at $330.
Service was excellent and the presentation of the meals fantastic and creative. Views were astonishing and you can go out onto the deck and take them in. can be a bit breezy outside. Limited food is available on the outer deck but you are at the mercy of the weather.
We had a time that took in the last of daylight and then into the evening as the city lite up.
We loved it and will be back."
"awesome view, you need to be lucky to get a good table, pricey meal","Food is decent and tasty, but it's a high-priced meal, so that's expected. waited 45mins for the food, service was average at best.

basically, you are here for the view, that's the best thing about the place."
Terrible Service,"As I write this review, I am sitting in this restaurant still waiting some a wait person to ask if I want to order food despite literally everyone around us eating their meals. The view is amazing, but Inwould recommend the Skybar, avoid this restaurant, it is average and we have eaten at so many other great restaurants in Singapore. I am also a hotel guest and really surprised by the lack if attention especially compared to other hotels that literally treat you like a star."
Good for the view and wine,"Service was good although a bit hectic, the view and wine was awesome, the food was pretty average. Some confusion about the specials menu by the server as well."
"Subpar food, abysmal service","Getting the attention of the staff is extremely difficult. To start off, when we wanted to order food, I waved to get the attention of 1 staff who obviously saw me but looked and walked away - she was not very near to us but the basic courtesy should have been to ask another of her colleague to assist us. We finally managed to get the attention of another female staff in black jacket near us who very rudely said that another staff will be the one taking our orders. The manager who was taking our order had no patience, and kept looking around when we were talking as well. Subsequently when the dishes came we had to repeatedly tell the staff to clear our finished plates so that there will be space for the other food. Staff did not bother to replace our individual plates when the sharing platter came. They also did not bother to give us sharing plates and utensils when our dessert came - only did so after us asking for it. For the price and location, I was not expecting us to be eating the dessert, consisting of ice cream and cake, with our bare hands. Food wise quality is average. I understand the open air concept but throughout the meal there were pieces of paper and rubbish flying to our table, some from the staff counter but no one bothered to clear them. Overall extremely unpleasant experience and service is abysmal given the price. We will never come here again and will not recommend our friends to the restaurant as well."
Worse services ever,"I booked a table at Ce La Vi (Singapore) on 17 December 2021 to celebrate one of my cousin’s birthday and a cousin’s return from the U.S. after 3 years. It was meant to be a treat for everyone after such a long ‘semi-lock down’.

When we arrived, the hostess was nice and friendly. She gave us an outdoor seat so we can enjoy the view. Weather was windy but manageable. All good until we settled down at our table.

We received minimal to no service through out the dinner. The service staffs were all standing around chitchatting but none came forward to take our order or serve us some water while we went through the menu. We waved numerous times and eventually one staff came over with a ‘can’t be bothered’ attitude (and face) after a good 10-15min.

Food and drinks came eventually. But midway through our meal, we felt light drizzle and again we waved at the staff. They saw us but none bothered to come over. They simply walk past us a few times. Eventually we got hold of a service staff and told her that we needed to move indoor asap. We had a jointed table and one of our table was not under the shade. So, some of our food were getting rained on and two of us were basically under the rain.

Instead of helping us, the service staff told us off. Her exact words were :”I’m very busy trying to help everyone. Pls wait.” And walked off. We were left helpless at our table with rain falling on us. She just walked away and then chitchat with her colleagues again.

The rain got heavier. Again we waved and she ignored us. We asked her if we could at least move our table so it’s under the shade while she sort out the sitting arrangement. She couldn’t be bothered with us again and just walked off. In the end, we had to move our table ourselves. There were wine glasses, food and our bags. It was messy. The worst thing is - there were 2-3 service staff just standing around watching carry the table and holding the wine glass so it doesn’t break. None of them step in to help.

After 5 mins, it started pouring. We waved to the service staff and asked for help again. They saw us but chose to ignore and continued to chitchat inside the bar. The rain and wind was so strong and all our food and wine were soaked in rainwater. We dashed to the shelters area and stood there. Our bags, wine and food were under the rain. All the staff just stood inside the sheltered bar.. looking at us. None came out to help.

By this time, we gave up. Grab our bags, clothes all wet and stood at the corner of the sheltered area to wait for rain to stop. Our wine and food were half eaten and soaked in the rain. No service staff came and check on us. My aunt was shivering in the rain and we had to wrap her in our shawl.

Eventually after a good 20mins or so.. it was still raining very heavily. The service staff came and ask us to pay for our full bill. She even had the cheek to tell us that we have to pay for the half eaten food and wine. She said - she went to check our table and saw the food already half eaten and we should be paying for it despite the rain. We had half a bottle of wine with rain water in it, beef soak in water, and a few other dishes as well. We complained about the service and the staff did not even apologize. She kept on telling us off that she is doing her best. Sigh.

We understand the weather is unpredictable but this level of service simply not acceptable.

Our evening was ruined. Our clothes and handbags were also wet because they refused to move us indoor or to help us find an alternative seat when we called for them. There were tables under the shade when we called them (when it started drizzling). They did nothing and we ended up soak in rain.

This was our worse ever experience at a 5 stars bar/restaurant. I would expect a much better service.

I have hosted many guests at Ce La Vi and enjoyed the evenings there before. I wanted to give my cousins a treat but it ended up with a very bad taste. We had to sent all our bags to bag spa for cleaning. And worse, one of my cousin fell sick after the dinner.

Please do check your cctv for full details of our evening and I hope to get a response from ce la vi management.

We paid a premium for the service and deserve none of these treatments at a 5 stars restaurant."
"Excellent staff@ Daryl, excellent atmosphere","A fantastic trip to Singapore’s iconic landmark feature made better by brilliant music, a wonderful relaxed atmosphere and most notably, fantastic service from our friendly, attentive waiter Daryl. For someone who had not been working there very long he was attentive to our every need and helpful in every way possible- completely making our visit worthwhile. We loved it and are booked in again for this week. Thank you Ce La Vie team and thank you Daryl!"
Terrible and disappointing,"Supposed to be a special night, but terrible and disappointing in all facets. Booking not respected despite booking a month in advance. Poor service. Unable to order food despite a 7pm booking. We left after a bottle of over priced champagne and had to go elsewhere to get actual food. Great view but save yourself to disappointment."
The only good thing about this restaurant is the location,"If you’re looking for an enjoyable dining experience, this isn’t for you. When I requested for some water, the lady serving me simply nodded her head, her expression changed from smile to annoyed, and walked away. And she did not serve me water. By the way, when we sat down, even after 15 minutes NOBODY came to serve us water. We had to ask for it.

After we were served the food, nobody came to check on our table. Our glasses were just left to empty out, and no one bothered to glance at our direction to see if we needed anything. It took 15 mins just to get someone to fill our glasses.

It seems like the staff didn’t want to work. Not sure if service has always been like this."
Worst dinning experience ever. Restaurant manager Uzair Yaccob never listen to what I asked.,"Went there last evening with my family. Food is way below par for the premium pricing. Service is worst ever. Restaurant Manager Uzair Yaacob did not listen to what I said when I enquired about HSBC Visa Infinite Dinning benefits. He just assumed I was enquiring on other HSBC card promotions. Charged me 3 bottle of still water but served only 1 bottle. Very efficient in charging you but not willing to service you. Served sushi starters without chopsticks. Waiter was stunned when we asked for 4 serving of soy sauce when 4 of us were sharing. 2 other starters came after we had finished our main courses. Asked Uzair why like that & he just brushed off saying the kitchen was very busy. He couldn’t bother to check with the kitchen. Informed another staff we wanted to cancel the 2 starters & asked for the bill since we had already finished our main courses. We had waited way too long. Within 2 minutes, the 2 starters arrived instead of the bill! The size of the Cod fish was 2 tiny scattered pieces for $58 vs on the small side Salmon portion of $48. Only Michael - the only waiter that made the entire experience less painful."
Not as good as before,We arrived and even if we asked for a lounge sofa during the booking they gave us a high seated table. We asked to change and they told us the minimum spent on such sofa were 500$ (which I don't believe as I come quite often and they never said such things - and no minimum spend is written on their website). And the girls next to us seated on the sofa clearly didn't spend 500$. Very disappointed of them. The service was not as good as usual. There are better rooftops in town that are worth much more than ce la vi.
Lovely rooftop Resturant,"Nice rooftop place with lovely view and bar, recommended to sit in the open area , visiting around 6:30 PM is nice time.

Service levels are not that good, recommended dish are Korean chicken wing and cocktails are nice

Peejae made our day, I think she is one of the major reason to visit this Resturant again"
Birthday visit,"Very good food and selections are just nice
Korean Chicken and Baby Back Ribs are so good!
I also love the unique birthday celebration platter! Staff are very attentive and made sure we got all we need and want! Thank you for making our evening a memeorable one!"
Ce la vi visit,Best place to go for drinks food and the best views Great service staff very polite and accommodating Karkei our server was great Strongly recommend this place
Worst experience ever.,"Just had the worst experience of my life at Celavi Singapore.

I made a reservation one month ago on 25th October for my anniversary dinner on 25th November 2021 at 7.15pm. We were already late for our reservation. However when we reached we were told to wait as they were still sanitising the table. We waited for a few minutes and question the host why do we need to wait when we have already made a reservation 1 month ago. They were not able to answer us and just mentioned that they need to sanitize as part of the Covid regulations.
Point 1. When we were brought to our table, the service staff (Anne) was just using wet wipes to clean the table. Is this the proper way of sanitising the table?

We then proceeded with our orders and ordered food and drinks.
Point 2. The waiting time was super long and when we check with the same staff (Anne), her replied was ""there are no S-pass holders quotas, hence they are short of staffs"". Instead of resolving our problem, she is telling us the management problems which the management should acknowledge about and not us. Besides, the new regulation of 5 pax only started on Monday. So if you are having limited staff, why are you still accepting reservations and up to 5 pax? In addition, one of our food orders was fries. We waited for around 30 to 40 mins. But the fries was so cold when we received it. When we confronted the staff (Anne), she just acknowledged it. No further action was taken from her. On top of these, i had also made a pre order a dessert as part of our anniversary dinner to surprise my partner. But there wasnt follow up throughout the whole dinner. The best part was they called me the day before to confirm this preorder but on the day itself, it seems like no one is aware of it.

Till this point, we were already super disappointed with the whole service and about to leave after our last drink. Suddenly the manager, i believe came up to us (without introducing himself or what), just asked ""Is everything okay?"" When it is already so obvious that something is wrong. We do not wish to blow up the whole matter and just asked for the bill. No action of solving the matter was taken and he went ahead to proceed with the bill and at the same time called for security. Is this the way of handling your guests when your service is the main problem? He did not even apologies for anything and feel upset about the poor service. It is very obvious that he lacks the basic experience in f&b and as a manager himself. Not even to mention his skills in problem solving.

Highly do not recommend this place to anyone unless you are here for the view."
"Amazing view, can't say the food is as never given a menu.so we booked for the bar vs inside restaurant (although it's basically","Stunning views and anyone new to Singapore this is one spot to give them the wow factor for the view. The food, we can't comment as we were never given a food menu in the bar outdoor area. Other than that the service was exceptional."
"Amazing view, great food and top-notch service!","We recently went there to celebrate hubby's birthday and we had a blast! Food was superb, ambience was lovely, service was top-notch and the cherry on top was the amazing view of the reddish moon in all it's glory...
I would like to personally thank Peejay for the sweet gesture of accommodating my request to have our desert from the set menu a little more special for hubby's birthday. We really couldn't ask for a better service from the rest of the staff especially, Ria and Michael who made sure we are ""belly"" happy.
Kudos to the Celavi Restaurant team! :)"
The most instagram worthy place in sg which serves fine cocktail,"This has to be the most instagrammed place in singapore and it deserves to be. Located at 57 floor of marina bay sands tower 3 although with a separate entrance its as ig worthy as it gets. My advise is to try their signature cocktails even, old memory abd happy afternoon.

For the other more generic cocktails you will end up paying much more than the usual places ( say le noir downstairs which will serve the same quality and wont charge a bomb).

For food i tried wagyu tartare - which was good - was it value for money ? deoends.
Since gere you pay for the ambience i would say yes."
An excellent service!!,"18-11-21 I was at Ce La Vi with a friend and I was surprised the amazing service provided by Mr Kai. He greeted us pleasantly and assisted with our reservation too. He was very professional from the very start and he did a great job. I loved his communication and people skills. I highly recommend him for the next level in his career advancement and also to train other service associates to his standards.

Wishing him the best for his career advancement and future endeavours.

In addition, I appreciate Miss Cherry for her great customer service.

It was a great experience in whole.

Warm regards,
Kalaivani Santhiramocan"
Mixed review,"First experience at the restaurant ; brilliant lovely food minus the Bombay potatoes which just didn’t really go with the food theme. Impeccable service so much so we went back the following night after Gardens at the bay.

Second night - service not as good had waygu beef tartare , very bland and not very good quality compared to Zuma and Roka in London. Prawns - well these were very odd prawns cooked okay but rolled in what I can describe as a crushed sweet cereal ?! … not very nice

Bao burger very very average !

BBQ fries again very very average

Cocktails hit and miss pina colada and pornstar martini very citrusy. Singapore sling and espresso martini lovely.

Lamb was beautiful and also a fan of ceviche and Korean chicken. Oysters - no. I would like to try the steak

Sushi - okay but I’ve had nicer I would however probably get some if I go again.

I would go back but I think I would send back dishes that were not up to scratch in future as It is a lot when some dishes are only about edible because your very hungry."
Great rooftop bar!,"Came to the sky bar twice already this month and I would suggest for everyone to better come visit on a weekdays if you can, as their weekends are very busy so there are a lot of movements around.

The drinks selection and offers are not bad, I tried the “Happy Afternoon” cocktail and their two hours of free flow and it was no regret at all. The scallops and oyster ceviche is a must try too by the way.

Lastly, I would like to say thanks to the staffs that I have met these two visits namely Erica, Eliza, Cherry, Push and Uzair. I really hope that I got all their names correctly though. They were very friendly and helpful. Despite of how busy it was, they always managed to check on your table every now and then.

One more thing, thank you very much for the surprise complimentary dessert to me twice already to welcome me and my friends after they knew that we are first timers there. It added a great experience and made the night more memorable! The dessert presentation added a wow factor too with the dessert that they served.

Good job everyone and till my next visit!!!"
Such is the bar,"The USP is the sky-high location of the bar. However, it serves average what other good bars serve on the ground. Chaotic a bit, and the serenity of the evening gets affected at times. It just does a decent job."
Nice view,Good city view from the top. Can be very windy and cold so ladies do be aware if not will be a hard night. Get a sofa seating to chill. Order light foods and drinks.
