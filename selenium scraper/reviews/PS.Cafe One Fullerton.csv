Supervisor Marvin is a total disaster.,Marvin only keen in serving people of his race and rushing other diners to bill and leave once done with meal. Total disgrace to PA Cafe service standard.
Standard has gone down the toilet.,"Been here a couple of times and it was pleasant. Went last week and it was not. Everyone's meals came out at different times even though the wait staff said it would come out together. Most of us had finished eating by the time our friend's pizza came out. The pizza was very soggy and oily. The crab mee goreng was simply filled with pasta, very salty and too oily. The truffle fries were nice enough. I guess the standard will continue to drop since the original owners have now sold it. Sad."
Simply garbage,"No reservation and solo and insist on seating me outdoor despite me asking for indoors. Wine and pasta were acceptable, presentable. My problem was the service. Totally non-existent. Instead of asking if i wanna have another glass, waitress asked if she could clear my plates and glasses. Tink i rather change my $200/- spent into coins throw it into wishing well. Thumbs downs. Not recommend."
Dinner,"We walked-in at the restaurant and we are seated by the staff (hostess perhaps) without greeting us or asking if we are celebrating something or etc. She gave us a bar seat. While ordering with the lady (short hair/boy cut) I requested if possible to transfer us on a better table ( low table) when theres available. She replied ""we are fully booked today, it will depends on our hostess"". When our food arrived, she never get back on us to give an update on our request. We understand that she might be busy, but atleast an update is much more appreciated. It only means that she never relay our request to the hostess cos even the hostess has no update on us. And yeah, because we are not comfortable having food at the bar, I accidentally drop my fork and had pasta sauce stained on my white shirt. Cos the fork they gave me is a dessert fork its lighter.

We also understand that due to pandemic there might be lack of staff but its not an excuse for us not to have a good service. During our dine we saw that theres a lot of table available on the other side of the restaurant perhaps they dont want to open that area even it should be open. Anyway we still love the food.

Another thing, one of the bar tender is always using his phone i think his name starts with J (jemson?) somthing like that i forgot his name. He dont bother to refill our glass of water even he is just hald meter away from us. Even its busy inside the dining area we still need to ask other staff on that area to refill for us. He dont bother to ask if we want any cocktails or wine, he just do his thing. He just use his phone.

Luckily Rachel approached our table, even busy she still manage to ask us if she can help us with anything. She's the only staff who smile at us we can see it even she's wearing a mask. Thanks for her service, she balanced it all.

Hopefully if we come back we see a different ambiance of the staff. Hopefully someone will ask if we have any allergens or any occasion to celebrate to make it more fancy cos PS cafe has a good place/view."
Terrible Customer Service,"I made a reservation and we turned up at the entrance to be greeted by no one!

We waited at the entrance for 10 minutes watching waiting staff walk past with not a care to come and take us to our table.

10 minutes later a moody waiter came up with no greeting at all and said sit down and wait. No hello, nothing.

I said I've made a reservation.

He effectively said that he didn't care as he was dealing with another group that were already waiting for 20 minutes to be seated before us.

We waited, as requested, for another 10 minutes then gave up.

We figured if it takes them 20 minutes to seat us when they know we're coming and we saw on their computer that we had a table already allocated for us then how long was it going to take to actually get any food and drinks?

Just appaling customer experience.

Won't be back."
The best of all the PS cafes,PS Cafe One Fullerton: Always love the French classy PS Cade especially at One Fullerton. Views of MBS waterfront and the tasty fare. This is cafe elevated to a classy affair. #eatstylishtravelstylish
Maybe three time's a charm?,"All in all, three very bad subsequent experiences at this subsidiary over a period of 1,5 month. #1 A potential dispute over an order whilst having a meeting late April. I ordered a Caesar salad with grilled chicken. Order came without the chicken. I ignored it because of my meeting. #2 No service outside whilst having a subsequent aborted lunch with wife and daughter early May. Daughter also fell inside due to lack of a visible marking of a step down coming from the outside terrace. #3 similar absence of service whilst having lunch with my son's family and my wife on the 4th of June. 4 times a request for wine service and uncoordinated food service. Was it busy inside? No, about 50% of the tables inside were not occupied and we were occupying the only table outside at that time. None of the (senior) staff even owned the lack of service and none apologized. 2 of (senior) staff were also involved in previous 2 incidents. One lady apologized to us outside the restaurant while we were waiting at the restroom, and whilst she came out of the restroom. Who she is, we don‚Äôt know but she was surely none of the 5 various (senior) staff that attended our table and should have owned the lack/absence of service.

BTW, we were asked on all occasions whether we made a reservation. We knew from previous visits that PS Caf√© (@ Harding Road) didn't take reservations for lunch. Obviously, this has changed which contributed to the overall experience of confusion and annoyance."
Desserts and tea at PS Caf√© could have been better,"After the lunch at the rather newly re-opened hawker centre at Market Street on Thursday, it was raining badly when I left. I took a long walk to avoid the rain to go to PS Caf√© at Fullerton Bay for coffee and dessert.
The elevator took us to the 2nd floor and I found the place.
My wife and I were led to the outdoor area inside. We sat at the indoor area inside the last time we were there a couple of years ago.
We asked for warm water and the glasses came with handle unlike the ones ok the neighbouring tables who had cold water so that was nice.
The guy came to ask for our order before we made up our mind. I don't know why he was rushing us. There were still a number of unoccupied tables. After I placed the order, I turned we made up our mind. After I placed the order, I turned around and took a photo of the seats behind me and the wall separating the aircon and non-aircon area.
My wife had a mint tea and I had a lemongrass blue pea tea.
They brought two serving plates and my was still wet so minus point for that.
We had a slice of chocolate banana cheesecake and a slice of brownie. Found that they were bit too sweet for our liking. Yes, desserts are supposed to be sweet but I should I have gone for the key lime pie I had the last time.
We tried to finish as much as we could but gave up leaving a bit in the end.
The people in the next tables left and I took a photograph with a better view of outside.
It was expensive as we expected, about $58 so not complaining about the price but at the price you are charges, you‚Äôd think you won't be given a wet plate.
As I left, I took a picture of the aircon section."
Poor Quality service,"The staff attitude was very lousy. I requested with the staff to change the table, But they've used the Company policy reasons to reject me many times even the table not occupied by any guests."
5 stars!,"5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è for PS.Cafe at One Fullerton! It was the first time for my wife and I tonight at this branch, chosen especially for the beautiful view of the Singapore skyline. The view from our table definitely did not disappoint! The food was really satisfying, especially the PS Burger but also the chicken penne. The service was nothing short of excellent as well, with Aliyah being our amazing server that made us feel right at home during our whole dinner experience. In fact, a huge commendation to every single staff here who were especially warm and friendly. Thank you so much! We hope to be back here again soon."
Kudos for Sarah üëçüèª,"commend the waitress - Sarah, she is a bespectacled lady who was attentive, cheerful, proactive and polite.
She was so professional and pay attention to details by asking our preference before she recommend the dishes to us."
Excellent Food and Service,"We were seated by the window with a good view upon arrival. The attentiveness given by the staffs are superb. Despite busy operations, Sarah is able to take good care of us and she will approach to ask how is everything. We felt that we are being taken good care and we did enjoy our dinner.

We will be back again :)"
Totally faultless,"One of the best cafes in Singapore and very deservingly so, PS Caf√© is so lush, so upscale posh and so faultless. You are always greeted by the perfumery of fresh flowers and luscious green plants when you set foot into one of the most amazing caf√© experiences. One Fullerton PS Caf√© is the newest addition to their collection and most of the most stunning as you are treated to the resplendent view of Gardens by the Bay. Service is impeccable. Their classic dishes taste heavenly and the caf√© is constantly punctuated by the welcoming hit of truffle oil. Funghi mushroom is gigantic and so finger-licking. Come and be knocked out of your senses here. #eatstylishtravelstylish"
Great food and Service!,"The food, ambience and service were fantastic!! Eric gave excellent service and will definitely come back"
Nice place to catch up with a friend,"Raju was kind to move us to the table we prefer. Aliyah was friendly and very attentive to our needs. Both have been checking on us and making sure everything‚Äôs alright. Me and my friend have not seen each other for a long time and this place is just perfect to have food, drinks and stories."
Great place for coffee with great view,"Ambience is good with indoor & outdoor tables. Truffle fries is a must try. The desserts were good, we had the sticky date pudding & keylime pie . The cafe overlooks the Merlion & the Fullerton bay. Great place to meet friends over a cuppa."
Wonderful experience,We were served by Ms Aliyah. Outstanding service! She has a wonderful customer service. Kept checking on us and ensuring our orders were all in order. Thank you Aliyah!! God bless you!
Dinner,Nice place to hang out with friends Staff Sun is attentive and provide excellent service to customers‚Ä¶. Good job üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
Dinner @PS Cafe Fullerton,Nice environment. Food is great. Service by Elyn is awesome. Definitely would recommend to friends & family. The dessert Golden Banana ButterScotch Bundt was delicious !
Good for late lunch with friends,"Invited by my bestfriend for late lunch here.(PS CAFE - One Fullerton)

Atmosphere: very good, not much people it was around 1.30pm

Food: ordered there specials for the day chicken xxxx I can‚Äôt remember the name but it was good. Big portion. It was good!! Well presented. Aperol spitz 1for 1 is still there , well made. And ohhh the deserts.... please go ahead and try the brownie.. (since then, everytime I visit I order this)

Service: to the lady (Chinese & petite ) who served us, from table water to the bill, she was very very nice, sweet, attentive and I love truly the service. She smiled, laughed, welcoming , ready to assist a long the way without that look (this is only what I can do for you- look). She also suggested the menu, what was specials and /or what we feel like eating.I really appreciate her but I didn‚Äôt got her name.

Price: a bit expensive but I don‚Äôt mind paying for the quality , quantity and most especially the service."
Always a Pleasure,"Always a pleasure to dine at PS Cafe, an old family favourite; and was more special when we took the girls to the branch at One Fullerton last Christmas break. Service was excellent and the food (specially old faves truffle fries and sticky date pudding) did not disappoint. Jaja from concierge made sure we had the best experience. Will always want to be back."
Friendly service,Was there for lunch with 2 friends. Crew Sun was very attentive. Good & friendly service. 3rd time there being nice environment.
Need to retrain or replace the Reception staff,"The local waitresses at the One Fullerton branch were friendly towards me, making me feel welcomed at the restaurant. They were helpful to recommend me the daily special which was nice. However, I am very disappointed with the expatriate lady at the reception. I had arrived early but there no one at reception. This lady came to reception to tell me to wait before walking off again. She didn't bother to check if I had a reservation and made me wait for 10 minutes. When she returned, she was sluggish to attend to me and her attitude was not welcoming at all. She was even surprised that I had a reservation at the restaurant. She impatiently directed me to follow her to my table. By this time, it was already 15 minutes past my booking. And when I was leaving the restaurant, after my meal, I saw this same lady playing with her phone at the reception and chuckling to herself. Although there were no other guest waiting, I find her behavior to be poor and very unprofessional. This was my first and LAST TIME dining at this restaurant. I hope the management will train their staff better, if they can't find anyone else to attend the reception."
I recently turned Vegan in,I recently turned Vegan in support of Veganuary and I cannot thank Eric and Jaja enough in helping me with my food alternatives when it comes to my order. Eric is a Vegan so I know that we‚Äôre finally in good hands. I always visit this outlet due to the quality of their service but last Jan 8 was really outstanding! I will see you all soon and keep up the good work!
Good ambiance with nice foods,It is better to reserve a table before you go as it is quite popular restaurant. The food portion is good and it taste great especially for the Fish n Chips. It is situated at marina bay and it is beautiful during the evening and night hours.
Excellent service staff and the food is always taste good! üòç,It's always good to be welcomed by the friendly staffs at Ps Cafe. I feel so comfortable dining at here and seeing the staff Elyn. She is so sweet and friendly to everyone. She is such a good asset to the company. And the food is really amazing and i really enjoy the food! That's the reason i always come back to Ps Cafe. Thank you and Merry Christmas!
Lunch,"Thank you so much to Jaja, Santrey and Eric for a wonderful afternoon experience! Even though it was busy, staff made sure that we were comfortable and that everything was okay. :)"
Great experience with wonderful views,Wonderful fantastic service by Elyn. Food was delicious! View was wonderful at Fullerton Bay. Elynn was thoughtful in ensuring that we were taken care of like sharing the portion or recommendations.She was mindful to give us space yet checks in with us.
Good service and food,The food was excellent and service from Elyn was good too! :) view of marina bay is nice if you sit outside
"Good Food, Good Ambience, Great staff","We came to celebrate our birthday with a view. Although we were given an indoor seat even when i requested for outdoor during reservation, i managed to change after but the minus point was it was jus a small table for two so it was kinda squeezy on the table.
View was amazing and staff that tend to us was compatible.
Food .. its all good except for one i felt that it was overprice to how it was served
Steak frites which came 3 bite slice and loads of fried was jus overprice
But we enjoyed the crabtart tt was recommended by the awesome staff(iforgot hername) she made gd recommendations including our dessert.
Cocktail Classic white is better than the red. My pref!

I cud hav given a 5 star rating if not for the steak. Cud hav done better u see

This place is always packed
So do book in advance to enjoy great seating area. Try the outdoor, its not stuffy and u can hav a great chat instead of the indoor. I cnt hear my gf sitting in there"
Enjoy the meal,"Had pizza and pasta to share, really enjoyed the meal, the staff are friendly and helpful. They even suggested half option for the fries as we ordered quite alot."
Food,"Great food, good mixture of flavours, the chocolate cake was amazing! Will definitely consider coming again."
Excellent Service and Great food üòä,"The crews are nice, bubbly and friendly. üòä Worth coming back for the fish and chips. And the biggest ever chocolate cake is superb üëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèº"
Visit to PS!,Lovely team at one Fullerton! They never disappoint us. Food and service were awesome. Truffle fries is a must to order! :)
Average food but saved by good service,"We went there for lunch and was early, so we were seated quickly. PS.Cafe is supposed to be well known for their good food but on this occasion, my friends and I found the food to be just average. I had one of their ""Specials"", which were written on a board - Crispy Roast chicken with onion gravy and garlic bread sauce. It was a decent portion but once you get over the sauce on the surface, the meat beneath was quite bland. Did they just grill the chicken without seasoning and just pour the sauce over it?

I also had the Portobello Mushroom Soup which was not bad, but the garlic bread had garlic spread over only half the bread.

We shared a starter of Crispy Seafood Basket and this was disappointing as many pieces not crispy and not very tasty. Did they keep these for too long before serving?

But the lunch was saved by the really great service of Celestine. She has a great personality, was smiley, cheerful, responded and explained well when asked, and was very helpful. I wished all service staff in our F&B sector would be like her. Keep it up, Celestine! PS.Cafe should be proud of you!"
Enjoyed the view and desert,We sat outside to get the beautiful view and it was very worth it. Food was good. Customer service was excellent. Enjoyed their desert the most. The chocolate blackout cake with the ice cream was fantabalous and mind blowing. My husband and I had an great evening.
"""First Timer""","Very nice and warm feeling during dining experiences, the first time there for a celebration with my girlfriend, they were friendly and was glad to do side arrangement and also do help people with indecisive thought to choose what to eat"
Great Lunch,Food and ambiance is nice. Service is great too. Thanks to Marvin who took care of me and my girlfriends throughout the whole lunch experience. He suggested foods that are really good and satisfying. We‚Äôll be back again for sure.
"Wear mask, wear mask, wear mask","Full of expectation arriving as I thought what a nice spot this PS Cafe has. Upon arriving 2 ladies were waiting for someone to show them in. We stood behind them and after a while, no one came. We got confused and walked in together with them. Finally a Pinoy guy usher us all out again and measure temperature of the 2 ladies and then bring them in. Took another 5min. of disappearance, I walked in trying to find out who can we ask to take us in, the same Pinoy guy came out and use his hands to ""Shoo"" me out and said ""can't you see I'm serving people to sit down?"" He showed us to our table. Upon sitting at tables outside the lovely balcony, I took out my mask as one of the string seems to be falling off from my ear, same Pinoy guy shove PS Cafe rules and regulation paper on table, hitting at that piece of paper, like a teacher ask me to read over and over again. I've never seen such rude behavior, I wanted to walk out but because I'm expecting my heavily pregnant gf and her husband, I held back.

So happy that the rude Pinoy guy disappeared after. Replace by a very pleasant nice Pinoy guy call Joel to serve us. So friendly and didn't mind my pregnant gf remove their mask before their drinks came.

Usual we ordered Truffle fries (portion seems smaller), I like their Phad Thai Salad (significantly thin slice of prawn and hardly any tofu), the rest have Parm Chicken, Lamb, Pasta all look nice and tasty. But dessert I would say is a disappointment. Is no longer as tasty as it used to be. The sticky date pudding has lost the magic. The Ginger pudding is too spicy for my guest and didn't look any good either.

We had 5 cocktails, 1 bottle of cheapest Pino Grigio, 1 glass of cheapest white wine, 4 mains, 3 dessert, 1 Truffle Fries. Total ~ 600+ For this price, I would prefer to go to CUT and Rhubarb where service and food never fail."
Just Excellent,"Went here for lunch with my girlfriend. We didn‚Äôt manage to make a reservation as website prompted lunch slots are full. Tried tried to walk-in and we were warmly welcomed by Jaclyn and ushered as to an outdoor table. View and ambiance are great! It was a rainy weather and so we didn‚Äôt mind seating outside. Celeste took our order and took care of our table. Food portion are surprisingly huge! Worth every penny. We ordered 3 main courses unknowingly portions are generous. From starters all the way down to dessert. We really enjoyed every bite. Special thanks to Joel, Eric and Marvin too who served our food and checked in with us every now and then. Will defintely come back!"
great service and consistent food but they need more vegetarian options,"service was great, quick and smiley, food is consistently great although for vegetarians it's very limited to 4 dishes.....2 starters (soup and salad) and 2 mains (impossible burger which is lovely) and pasta...

you need to do more! but great atmosphere outside and lovely place to relax and enjoy a drink"
Good ambience and service!,Good ambience and service from Fullerton Outlet. Server Jaclyn has a great knowledge of the menu and is very proactive and bubbly. Really love the service from this outlet.
Excellent service by Zuilaika,"really friendly waitress, awesome service :) recommended us food eagerly and sure enough the food tasted great! :) will be back!"
Good food at PS. Cafe,"I had a very good visit here, with each dish hitting the mark. The chicken parmigiano is my absolute fave and went down very well with a nice prosecco. The chicken rossa penne was also great! We would have provided 5 stars, but the service noticeably became slower at 5pm after shift change, which was a real shame. Before that, our glasses were being topped-up very attentively. But still, very much worth visiting if you are in the area. I liked it a lot!"
Best truffle fries ever,"The restaurant is located at the level 2 of one fullerton and we got a little lost on the way there as the lift/staircase was a little hidden. Ambience of the cafe is amazing and food quality is outstanding. The shoestring truffle fries is a must order every time we are at the cafe, it has a generous servings of cheese with very strong aroma of the truffle which we couldn't resist."
Excellent service provided by Jason,We were very blessed to have a server by the name of Jason to assist us with our orders and whatever nitty gritty needs we have ... his attitude was excellent and he is always obliging no matter what we requested .... he is smiley and jovial ... and he knows his stuff well... he did such a great job that I had to post this ... I usually don‚Äôt like to entertain requests for reviews .. and not forgetting the food is excellent.. we such such gd crab tarts .. fish and chips ... and even simple pizza was so well executed ! Good job!
Great Food and service,Great food and service with a perfect view! We even had complimentary cake from their waitress Yona :) thank you!
Birthday Dinner,Service was excellent. Food was good and delicious. Staff Yona and Eric was really friendly. Overall we enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere there. Would highly recommend to go there!
Beautiful location. Excellent service. Great food,If you‚Äôre looking for a restaurant with a view and great food to boot visit PS Cafe at One Fullerton. Excellent service. Thanks to Xinying for looking after us so well! Oh - don‚Äôt forget to keep some room for the chocolate cake!!
Good meal and excellent service,"Position on the 2nd level at one Fullerton, they have a bit of outdoor space but the view is a bit limited due to trees outside the windows Food was good, tasty. And service excellent"
Cool ambiance & decent nosh,"The place sells itself with its cool relaxed vibe, open views over the riverfront although much of it blocked by overgrown trees directly in front of the windows.

The menu satisfies cravings for oily grub, vegan nosh & quite a bit in between. The dishes are plated appetisingly and actually taste pretty decent. We've had their ribs, fish & chips, big breakfast & eggs ben.

The thing is... nothing isn't memorable or bad, just decent. And their much-lauded truffle fries are just that. Shoestring fries, cooked to a respectable crisp, sprinkled with shredded parmesan and truffle oil. Comes out piping hot. It's good but I'm not making a detour for it. You'll eat it, enjoy it but I'm not gonna write home about it.

Sans the location and ambiance, the food wouldn't fare as well at their current pricing. So really, it's a combination of all the elements that make PS. Cafe here at one fullerton a justifiable place for a respectable meal.

Sadly, you wouldn't be coming here for their service. Although polite, it's somewhere between laid-back casual and efficiently detached. It's a little charmless. I can't put my finger on it but it's not memorable and inviting. I know, strange.

BUT, it's a less harried experience compared to the other central PS. Cafe branches. At least you get the feeling of being out of the hustle and bustle of the city."
Excellent service,Excellent service by Martin and Maricel!!! Great food as well!! Big food portion. Definitely will be back here
Invest in Peroni glasses,"Great food with wonderful views! I love that PS Cafe has Peroni on tap, but the experience is a major let down as you‚Äôre drinking this beer from an oversized water cup. This is the only restaurant in Singapore who doesn‚Äôt serve Perioni in a branded Peroni glass. By all means, please invest in the proper beer glasses."
Nice Food,Great meal! Love their dessert and pizzas! Would come back to try out their main dishes. The truffle fries are nice too.
The quality of food is the great!,"The quality of food is the same regardless of the location of PS Cafe but the One Fullerton location just added that extra bit of ambience and coziness for a great night out with your loved ones.

Excellent and prompt service from the crew as well when I last visited. Attentive and always carries a smile while engaging with our questions"
Great vibe & food,"Visited this place for lunch yesterday. My friend and I ordered a pizza and a dessert to share. Portions were big and the food was yummy. Great ambience with an amazing view of the Marina Bay area. Overall, we had a pleasant experience with great service; one gripe would that be that service was not as efficient as expected - it was hard to catch the attention of the staff as we were seated in the corner. Nonetheless, the service provided to us was impeccable and we would definitely return!"
Great food big portion,- enjoyed the truffle oil fries and pizza. - great service - 2 of us had a hard time finishing the meal... but it was delicious.
"Great location, decent food","Pleasant bar / cafe / restaurant in the One Fullerton complex, very close to Merlion Park. Busy atmosphere, friendly staff, efficient service. The food was good but nothing memorable. Prices reasonable for the location. Site outside on the terrace or inside in the AC."
Superb Service and Sweet Endings,"There‚Äôs much to love about PS Cafe at One Fullerton - the interiors, the ambience and the views of the Bay and the iconic Sands Hotel. There‚Äôs also a list of good food from starters to desserts. Because we are a dessert - loving family, our sweet endings should not be short of excellent and this restaurant fulfills that criteria superbly. When unable to decide, the sticky date pudding is our go-to, it is always consistently delicious. Service consistency is also one thing PS Cafe branches offer. We frequent Paragon and Dempsey branches and are always giving two thumbs up to the waiters, and managers who make sure that our dining experiences are more than pleasant. Thank you, Marvin Magpantay and team!"
"Great food, ambience and best serviceüëå",Food's great and service is excellemt too. always leave room for their best dessert: Sticky Date with Vanilla Ice cream üòã
Excellent Desserts,"Recently stopped in for dessert and coffee one evening on a friend's recommendation. The cafe was busy, but we had no problems being seated as we had made a reservation in advance. The ambience is very welcoming with a youngish vibe. We thoroughly enjoyed our two desserts, carrot cake and profiteroles; the coffee was great as well. We look forward to a return trip for a meal the next trip to Singapore."
Awesome service,Great customer service from both Maricel and Sherry in PS Cafe One Fullerton.. will definitely be back!
Traveller,"Good food, good view, good staff. Thank you Mylene for taking care of my mom and me tonight. You made my trip so wonderful."
Perfect ambience and delicious food,"Always a favourite cafe for lunch, tea, dinner, drinks or dessert. Their dishes and desserts never fail to impress. The truffle fries are a speciality and must-try! The ambience is lively and the decor is lovely."
Great Experience!,"It was our first time to dine in this restaurant. Food was great! My son loved the pizza and truffle fries. The ribs and burger are awesome! It‚Äôs great that they serve variety of beverages, too.

The location was very accessible. We were seated outside, overlooking the view.

Thanks to Mr. Marvin and Mr. Eric for a great customer experience! Will definitely be back and recommend the place to my friends"
Great place for afternoon meal,"This is a must go place if you‚Äôre looking for a great ambience with glass view of outdoor Singapore marina bay, compliment by great choice of food, and the must eat truffle fries!

Had a lunch meal with 3 pax with a total bill of $70. Still affordable with great service and good food."
Red Pesto Rigatoni,"I had lunch at ‚ÄúPS.Cafe Fullerton‚Äù, the largest PS Cafe in Singapore. This was my 1st visit to PS. Caf√©. PS Cafe Fullerton is located in One Fullerton. This is the building by the sea next to the Merlion. It is across the road from the Fullerton Hotel, Level 2. I enjoyed the ambience with a Waterfront View. The terrace was directly looking over the Waterfront. I had a vegetarian Red Pesto Rigatoni. This main is prepared with Eggplant, broccoli and green leaves; the vegetables were well cooked and easily chewable. The red pesto was mildly flavoured with some kind of nuts, for an added flavour. I enjoyed this meal and it was not heavy. I had Lychee with lime cooler (recommended by Cindy). The drink was refreshing and cooling.

SEE photos."
Excellent !!,"Having lunch with friends today. Excellent service from all the staffs! The food is great and the portion is unbelievable! Last but not least, the view is AMAZING! Definitely will visit again!"
Memorable meal,"We did not have a reservation but were seated rapidly on the terrace where there was a lovely cool breeze . Our waitress ,Maricel, was really efficient and friendly . She reseated us at a window table which became available and we were able to enjoy the stunning view over the river to The Marina Bay Sands and see the laser show .

I asked how spicy the Thai chicken and basil bowl and she assured me the kitchen would reduce the amount of chili . It was delicious and just right. . My husband said the fish and chips were excellent . The deserts are superb and very generous portions .
All the staff were friendly and happy to have a chat and recommend nice food or talk a little about Singapore .If you are a visitor to Singapore , this restaurant is upstairs from the other river front restaurants, or find it easily from Fullerton Road"
Great food and Service!,"The food, ambience and service were fantastic!! Maricel, Eric, Noel, Ming Xuan gave excellent service and will definitely come back üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
Excellent Staff,Food is exceptional. Service staff is friendly and attentive. Our friend enjoyed her birthday. Order the garlic shrimp pizza
Thumbs up!,"Never fails to deliver the best food and service! Thumbs up to the amazing team sherry, marvin and maricel!"

"Great ambience, great hospitality and great food","Went to PS cafe @ One Fullerton first time on a weekday night, with a group of friends. Well situated at level 2, with magnificent view of Marina Bay. Greeted by friendly staff at the entrance. Special thanks to Yona for the hospitality. She was attentive, prompt and friendly, making us enjoying the night with the great food and ambience. Food recommendation from appetiser, main course to dessert were great.

Had an awesome time at PS Cafe,"Not only was the cafe beautiful in itself, it also had a scenic view. Marvin assisted us and he has a good knowledge of what they are serving. He recommended a few stuff like the Laksa, which I ended up ordering and it was really good!! It was a great experience overall. It‚Äôs my first time to visit the PS Cafe and I‚Äôm definitely going to visit again!"
Nice Ambience & Great Service,"Visit this place for the first time and dined in over a business meeting.

Both my client and I was impressed with a staff by ‚ÄòJu‚Äô, she was very precised with repeating our orders and was good in recommendations.

Pasta and pizza was great and the environment was lovely. Definitely coming back again!"
Loving the place,Marvin and Eric has been extremely helpful and the food is awesomeeeeeeeeee. Must try the impossible burger!
PS Cafe One Fullerton Review,"It was our first time here and had a wonderful experience. A place with great service and friendly staffs.
Yona did a joyful approach and helped us took a group photo.
Ju gave a good recommendation for our dessert which is Coconut Bakewell Tart. A must try if you love coconut.
Sherry is efficient in ensuring our finished dishes are cleared and water refilled.
Thank you PS Cafe One Fullerton for the wonderful dinning experience! =)"

A jewel on the river , the ambience and view are amazing and the staff ( thank you to Ju and Maricel ) take service to the next level in terms of professionalism and attitude . All in all a great experience and I ll definitely be back :)"
Great dining experience!,Commendable service. From making a table reservation on the phone with a friendly lady through exchanging goodbyes when leaving the cafe. Taking this opportunity to express my thanks for the display of friendliness n generosity extended in dishing out to us the complimentary fries served on a pretty silver tray. What a pleasant surprise! Big cheers n smiles particularly to Anthony n his entire team. Thank you!
Excellent food and great service!,Came here with family to enjoy the national day fireworks. We had an enjoyable meal and was well looked after by Maricel who was very attentive with prompt and polite service. It was a very memorable evening.
A great meal and even better service,"I never get disappointed with dinners at PS Cafe. We ordered a seafood and mushroom half-half pizza, a pumpkin soup and the lamb cutlets.

A great meal usually is coupled with amazing service. Really big thank you to Marciel and Yang who went really over and above to take care of my partner and I. I would come back again, without a doubt."
Pleasant experience,"Thank you Marciel and Xin Ying for your warm welcome to PS cafe. It was a pleasant hospitality right from the entrance to my seat and to the end of our meals.
Very responsive and attentive to our needs.
Food is good too!
We will definitely revisit!"
Birthday Treat,"We met the loveliest and sweetest bunch at this PS Cafe when we tumbled into the restaurant minutes to midnight looking for a birthday cake. The staff were already preparing to close for the day so we weren't hopeful. But Yona, Ju, Xin Ying, Sherry and Jay exceeded all expectations when they appeared with a magnificent cake, lit the candle and broke out into a brilliant birthday song. Thank you again for the kind gesture and heartwarming experience :-) you all truly went the extra mile and we appreciate it so much."
Good service and food,"Awesome food with excellent hospitality service from Joel at P.S Cafe One Fullerton üëç The club toast is awesome, can actually be shared by two"
"Lovely food, relaxing ambience, great service - Thanks Yang! :)","Came here for later afternoon snack followed by dinner.
1st visit to this PS Cafe @One Fullerton, definitely won't be my last! Seated outdoors, the ambience was very relaxing, despite being situated within the CBD. The food's delicious as with its other outlets. Yang's service was excellent - attentive, prompt, friendly, gives off a very helpful and approachable vibe. Had a very enjoyable dining experience thanks to him."
"Warm, helpful & friendly staffs","We were here one lazy Sunday afternoon for desserts & drinks & love the ambience with a magnificent view of the Marina Bay! Firstly, we arrived half an hour earlier before our reservation! Yet we‚Äôre still welcomed warmly! The whole tea break experience was great! Between those yummy delicious young coconut panna cotta, ginger pudding with earl grey anglaise & the never disappointing Florida key lime pie! When we were just about to leave, my daughter‚Äôs Invisalign(which she placed on the napkin) was accidentally cleared & thrown in the bin! The staffs were very helpful to dig in the rubbish bin to look for it!"
Excellent!,"Our family frequently go PS Cafe for our Sunday brunch. We usually go to the one at Hardings, Martin and One Fullerton. But the one we like best is the one at One Fullerton. The ambience is good, the food is good, and the view is great with a superb view of the Marina Bay. Most important, we like the people here. The manager Marvin is always friendly and professional, and make sure that everything‚Äôs well taken care of. We are also very impressed with Sun, who always greet us with warmth, remembers our preferences of food and drinks, and always provides excellent service throughout the meal. We have always enjoyed our dining here!"
Bachelorette party,A lovely night out with my dearest bridesmaid and the staff here are the sweetest. Sum and his colleagues went out of their way for a special night for me!
June 21 dinner,"Great ambiance, superb food and excellent service. Special recognition to Marvin and Joel for their outstanding service!"
Birthday dinner,"everything else was good, except our order that was sent to another table, and kept us waiting for 60 mins. Waitress Xing Yin did a great job on service recovery. Good job. Complimentary birthday cake was a plus too. Keep it up."
Get your basic training right - Terrible Service!!,"First impression and boy did they not disappoint with their terrible handling. It was a birthday occasion and we stood outside, waiting to be seated. The hostess/supervisor Yona was terriblly curt and merely replied ""just a moment"".

Kept my friend and I waiting for a good 20mins and kept listening to her mention ""just a moment"" three times which thereafter she disappeared and another hostess had to come ask us again for the reservation!!

Best part yet to come, a line had started to form and a causasian couple happily cuts the queue which the supervisor Mervin saw but under the pressure of a customer, immediately allowed him to cut and brought them to their seats. It feels so sad that you give another race so much more privilege than having the same equality. Bad bad taste. They ended up taking our seats (seems to be a first come first serve basis) and we were offer outdoor seating after being asked to wait... AGAIN.

The only saving grace was this chirpy young lady Xin Ying! Great smile and took really good care of us throughout our meal. Asking if the food was fine and doing all the necessity of a decent F&B establishment.

I had been to other location of P.S Cafe and this is the first time I encountered such an issue! They are a total mess, couldn't handle the reservation, customers waving their hands and being ignored; no acknowledge. Get your management to re-train themselves and learn from their ground staff who are so much better."
Nice food & good ambience!,The outdoor seating has very good view over marina bay. The truffle fries is very good & the bartender Ju has a sight for good wines. Highly recommend!
Family Dinner Date,our first time to dine here at PS cafe and the interior was impressive and elegant. Our dining experience became more special because of Joel who has been very attentive and accommodating to us. He even took an extra mile of proactively helping us with our orders and things we need. We‚Äôll definitely come back here and recommend to our friends.
