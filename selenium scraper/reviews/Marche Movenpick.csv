Perfect place for a great feast‚Ä¶the food choice along with the way it‚Äôs prepared is too good‚Ä¶ a must visit place,Definitely worth visiting‚Ä¶. The cuisine is just great ‚Ä¶.staff is good ‚Ä¶ Swiss rosti is a must have ‚Ä¶.cooking is all fresh with the perfect ambience
Love Marche,"One of my favorite place, nice and quality food, excellent service. The mushroom soup and bread is a must try. The grilled meat is awesome. They are very generous with the grilled mushrooms. Love the ambience and the very Swiss style dinning experience. Good gatherings place for family and friends."
Excellent roesti and ice cream,"We had a wonderful lunch here! The roestis were some of the best we've ever had. Other food was great also. But, special mention to the incredibly delicious chocolate ice cream!!!"
Great experience,"Outstanding food, so many different kinds of food to try, great for vegetarians and vegans, would definitely recommend and come back"
Great dining concept,"The family calls Marche a upmarket Swiss food court in Singapore. In fact, the concept is similar to our personal experience in Switzerland.

It‚Äôs convenient walking around with one card, staring at all the awesome looking dishes, especially the live cooking stations.

I would say the quality of the ingredients are good and offers singaporean a unique dining concept.

Well designed interior making the entire dining experience a cosy one. Food was tasty as well."
Poor food if you get it from rude staff,"Called in for food and drinks 4pm Sunday
Not busy, many free tables.
1 order of chicken pizza
1 order for half chicken
Pizza bland and lacking flavour
After waiting for 25 mins went to ask where order of chicken was. Staff very rude. Said I hadn‚Äôt ordered with them! Why had they given me an order buzzer then!!!
Check out staff gave apology but not the rude service station staff.
Won‚Äôt be going back in a hurry.
Poor experience."
"Food was decent, service was horrible","Understand that it was Christmas eve and a busy day for the restaurant, but the service was honestly appalling.

First (and the WORST) bad experience: waitress holding a tray wanted to walk but we were unknowingly blocking her way. Instead of saying excuse me politely, she decided to use the tray she was holding to push and poke me in the back until I stepped aside and turned around. And even then, she walked past without even saying sorry or looking at us.

Second bad experience: waiter wanted to walk past awhile after the first waitress pushed her way through, he raised his voice at us saying EXCUSE ME before walking past.

Third bad experience: wanted to order pasta and stood at the counter (there were no other customers at the station) but was not acknowledged even though the chef was right in front of us. Chef was cooking some stuff before walking away to get more ingredients, leaving us there without acknowledging or even looking at us. After a good 5 minutes of standing there, he finally told us to give him a moment. Could have at least acknowledged our presence and tell us to give him a moment, I‚Äôm sure it doesn‚Äôt take long to tell us that.

For a service line, that is simply rude and unacceptable. Decided not to make a fuss at the restaurant since it is a festive holiday. Hope to see an improvement."
For Rosti üëçüèª,Always a good idea to dine here. And Rosti with a large scoop of sour cream is our favourite of the lot. We also a few more. But the mashed potatoes with beef steak didn‚Äôt taste like mashed potatoes. It was like some potatoes were unevenly hand crushed was served. Lacked the texture and the taste. Service is fine.
Great service,"Great service by all staff from entrance till i leave,especially Ms Suay Han,very genuine service from heart.She also helped by explainng drinks menu at bar,polite and cheerful."
Could have been PERFECT,"1. The entrance Hostess could do better if she explains properly.
2. The Cooks were fantastic and the food was good. Kudos to the Aunties behind the counters!
3. Cashier needs to be more pleasant considering the fact that she is working in a restaurant.
4. Filipino Staffs always acting busy and never there when you need them.

Finally, special thanks to the Chinese waitress for her excellent service."
Nice Ambience with Reasonably Priced Food,Marche is like IKEA but with a variety of good quality European foodfare. The weekday express lunch set is reasonably price. Soup was good. Found a fly stuck in the juice section but already feedback to the one in charge of the juice.
Fillet fish got bones.,The standard is drop already. Service recovery not good enough.seafood platter the snapper fish got few bones.
Average Food & Below Average Service from the Grill Station,"The boy (name: Wei Kiat) & his mate at the grill station probably woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.

1) Poor attitude;
2) Snatched my ordering card rudely after I placed my order;
3) Just stuff the buzzers to me;
4) Forgot to fried my calamari and did not bother to apologies but told me to go back again;
5) Quality of calamari was poor, over fried & bitter and worse of all, they RE-FRIED the left over pieces of calamari to serve to me.

The 2nd star given was for the sake of some better attitude crew from the drinks station & cashier.

Wanted to seat & chillax to have a cup of latte & dessert after my dinner but did not bother to do so."
March√© Review üëéüèª,The rosti was pale in color and tasted undercooked. There was no queue and it was not tasty. I hope you can change
Not all are good,"Crepes are nice mushroom soup is good, rosti w salmon is OK.
Seafood aglio olio is a disaster. Long wait time, undercooked pasta, bitter tasting flavor. Only the appearance of it looks attractive, but beware.
Take note you are paying for the ambience & food, because you can surely get better fare at a better price."
Swiss Treat,It was the best experience. Try Swiss Potato Rosti. Bit costly but worth the money. Pasta and Pizza was also quite filling. Excellent
Good swiss restaurant,"We were there to celebrate my daughter birthday. She was given free birthday cake and also $20 gift return voucher. The atmosphere was great, not too crowded and easy to navigate the food stations. The downside is the smell of bbq smoke, it was quite strong, i remember it was not so strong before, may be they should check the ventilation to improve it.

Overall, it was a good experience, good food, though pricey"
Excellent Rostii,Marche is not simply a restaurant but a farmhouse food experience. You can customise your food with the several options they have. My favourite has always been their original swiss rostii. Their potato quality is excellent and it is cooked beautifully. I then added mushrooms and sour cream and the dish was heavenly. A must try for all!
What you see is what you get,"A resturant that serve bg portion of food. Ice cream was nice. Other then that, price is a bit steep."
Feedback,"Restaurant should have an entrance and exit, where customers can change pass to exit for awhile and not clash with those people queuing. Very messy!"
"Plesently surprised, very good.",Never tired this dinning experience before but we really enjoyed this new style food ordering system with a brilliant ambiance. Very good choice of food stations offering freshly prepared mains to suite all palates. The German mixed grill XXL was my favourite. A good night out for 8 persons very reasonably priced.
Lunch at Marche,The service and the food are equally good. The service crew Lagi shows a lot of patience while we deciding which table to sit.
Worthwhile with eatigo,"So glad to see Marche‚Äôs 50% discount offer on eatigo. You can have a Swiss sausage rosti, Spanish paella,Italian burrata, Mexican guacamole and German beer all at one place at half the price on a Saturday linner. Staff are nice and helpful. They may get frazzled when stressed so please be patient with them. The quality is good and portion are reasonable for sharing."
Reasonable Price,Good to go during weekdays during lunch. No frills set lunch which is at a reasonable pricing with drinks.
Average food,Food selection was not great and taste was average only. Only chose this place for the kids play area. Staff had a difficult time with the time because we bought Chope vouchers.
Can try,Has been such a long time since we visited Marche. It is still the same as before. Quality of food is still there. Food is freshly prepared on the spot. Juice is also fresh!
should have read these reviews first,"Disappointed - cramped space, poor choice n quality of food, rude staff at grilled platter. Asked him how long i need to wait - 5 mins? He said: Just wait for buzzer - thats whats its for! There was no Q at all. I should have known better."
Great concept and good food,"This place gives you a card and there are various counters of different food courses, where you can order, receive the food and pay using the card. And finally, you pay based on your food selections. The concept was new to me and was a good one too. The ambience was also good. You find crepes, pasta, pizza mostly all dishes with various customisable options like subway. But, one improvement would be provide drinking water and they charge 5 sgd which is a bit pricey. Other than this, I would suggest this restaurant for moderate budget Italian food."
Drop in quality,"Came back for the pizza because I really enjoyed it the previous time (prawn) I was here and again the pizza (minced beef) was great! The rosti was good as well . However, the seafood aglio olio was a huge disappointment. The noodles had no flavour even though the prawns were good. The grilled seabass was fishy as well. The white bait were so-so as well. The waffles did save the meal but overall I would only go back for pizza, rosti and waffles next time."
Good rosti,"Their rosti are so nice. Love their rosti! Had the pasta as well. Not bad but the pasta is not cooked al dente. Too soggy.
Tables wise - They are all so sticky. They should wipe the table instead of just clearing the tables. It's all so sticky!"
Nice & Fresh,"We had to queue for dinner on a Saturday night - but it was not too long given the time of day.

We met friends here and it's a novel way to eat. They give you a card (similar to a credit card) and you swipe it at each stall you get food or drink from. Then at the end of the night - you pay.

There are many choices and a lot of variety for both food and drinks. Our party ate a combination of rosti's, pasta and paella - all very fresh. It was busy but you didn't feel like the staff didn't have time for you.

We would eat here again"
Good food good choices,"Used to come here a lot, so after 5 years away decided to try it again. Not so busy this time for lunch. Specials board includes main course and small fruit drink. I had paella and smoothie of the day. Lovely food and reasonable value."
Marched to enjoy here,"This is an unusual way to eat/order, but the food was of a very good standard.

We didn‚Äôt realise quite how this restaurant operated when we arrived, so there was some initial confusion on our part about the process. Each diner receives a swipe card (like a hotel key card) which you take to the various stations in the restaurant and order whatever food you‚Äôd like at each station.

There was a station for pasta, roast meat, pizza, salad, Swiss Potato rosti, fruit drink, the bar and desserts.

Our children both ordered off the set children‚Äôs menu, which still gave them a range of choices.

We had roast beef and rosti with sausage. The food was very tasty. The decor was great. The restaurant even has a play area for children, so a great experience after we got over the initial confusion."
Swiss!??,"Bought gift cards for 3000SGD and they were not willing to give a free beer.. No swiss mentality at all, shame for a ""Swiss"" restaurant and the CEO/team leader in there."
Confusing though food fairly good,"Friends chose the venue though I usually find Marche too confusing a concept for Asian consumers. In a hot, sweltering climate, the restaurant wasn't cool enough especially with all the cooking going on and some tables at the side lay in the sun. We had to circle the stations 2 or 3 times before we could decide on what to order as there seemed to be duplicates of salad or meats from different stations. Finally decided on the rosti where again agonising choices of types of sausage and portion sizes loomed. Must say the different varieties of sausages were delicious though a tad salty, even the pasta was salty with bacon bits and a creamy , cheesy sauce slathered over. Appreciated the mustard and variety of sauces, including spicy options, though.
Staff are not particularly friendly or helpful, smiles don't cost anything, the two ladies were frantic when I exited and demanded my card which I had given to my friend who was paying for all of us. Surely there is a better system to make sure that payment is made and not upset customers who have no intention of running off without settling the bill! Unpleasant experience."
Something for everyone,"A vegetarian, a meat eater, 2 very hunger guys after a swim, all coming at different time yet able to enjoy a relaxed lunch. Started with salad made on the spot with freshly made drinks. This was followed by rossti, savoury crepes of smoked salmon with mushroom, a pasta and some roast beef."
Its a perfect setting for a brunch,"Its well managed, organized and the green ambience is so calming. Food is expensive and a bit bland in taste. But who cares. We had a good time"
Lovely lunch,"Food was good and nice place, except for the many choices was quite confused since it was our first time here. Food serving is quite big size especially for the ladies."
"High price, average food bad dinner for anniversary couple","We had wanted something special for our 10th anniversary dinner. Queued for almost 2hrs, our assigned was packed, messy and ambience was noisy you could hardly hear your partner.

Ordered beef, chicken, pasta, pizza, dessert and some beer cost over more than $200.

High price, average food, long queue, packed and noisy. Worst is you need to go to individual stall queue to order your food and bring to table. We could have enjoyed a better ambience and food at a 5 star hotel for that money spent for a good anniversary dinner. We only have regrets coming."
Good food but limited service,"Visited on a Thursday night and happy to see there was no queue! Had the rosti, sausage, and crepe, all of which were good! Movenpick tiramisu ice cream is my fave! Service was pretty bad though, staff seemed unfriendly and unwilling to help. No cutleries available."
Delicious cake,"Went to Marche recently and was surprised by the quality of the cake. Tried two flavors - Baileys Tiramisu and Brownie Overload. If you‚Äôre ordering latte, suggestion would be to add an extra shot of expresso for a stronger coffee."
Dip in standard,"We have enjoyed the food at this outlet for many years. But recently have been a tad disappointed This time round was shocked. The rosti usually the family favourite and a staple dish was so sad. The potatoes were under cooked, pretty raw. And what I saw later was worse. The potatoes usually after being grated should be in water, they weren‚Äôt and they were pink! Oxidised. The potatoes on the shelf had so many that were green!
The next put off thing was when the lady was making my crepe she put the shredded cabbage that was blackish. I had to ask her to take it out.
Pizza was undercooked.
Very disappointing to see this I‚Äôm not going back anytime soon. They turn out dishes fast so people eat and exit fast. But at this rate I don‚Äôt think they need to worry about that.
Sorry Marche‚Äô I was a fan but I‚Äôm really truly disappointed"
sentosa's best hotel,"best stay, nice pool, big rooms with electric curtain, nice lobby, mono rail connectivity. food tasty"
Food is Life,"Every food is freshly cooked/served in the restaurant so you need to have patience while you wait for your turn on the queue line. With lots of variety, you feel like getting everything. The food serving is quite big and 1 order is good for 2 pax. We grab a beer alongside and it was a perfect place for group catch up. Superb food and staff!"
LOVE IT,"The r√∂esti is to die for. I had it with the cheddar cheese and oh my, it was heavenly. Grab a beer alongside or one of their homemade drinks and you're set. Highly recommend the desserts too and if you're a big eater, try the salad station- their mushrooms are out of the world."
Good variety of food,Wide variety of food there even though everyone flocks to the Rosti station. Most food cooked fresh on the spot so there might be some waiting during peak hours. Price is on the high side.
Very nice place,"Its a very nice place with too many varieties of delicious delicacies. You are given a credit card and every time you place order, they swipe it and during exit, you will have to pay. The foods are really good and with so many varieties, you get confused as which one to pick n eat."
Won‚Äôt get fooled again,"Business group of 12. They had plenty of room for us, and after the high price, low quality food I can see why. Won‚Äôt be fooled again as this place is checked off the list Singapore has many wonderful restaurants. Please go to one"
Best all round expat resturant in Vivo city,"Marche restaurant in Vivo city is excellent. from the moment you walk in until you leave, you just feel as though everything is fresh. the concept is excellent the ambience, looks really fresh and the food is very high quality. Like all western food in Singapore its not cheap, but a great place to take families or work colleagues who have had enough of the normal Asian cuisine. All ways something for everyone here. there lunch specials are good. Be careful of sitting in the sun at the window during lunch time as it can be hot."
Too costly for such below average food,"Crepe - ordered smoked salmon crepe. The smoked salmon was way too salty and the purple cabbage slices were very bitter (BUT WHY?).

Seafood paella - The rice was also very salty. Ingredients were too hard (overcooked).

Rosti - Inside was rather undercooked.

The Roselle Orange Tea is the only decent item there, for a whooping $3.90 for a small glass.

Wasted my $62.40 (perhaps less the $3.90) and 20 mins wait in the queue."
Good food but very costly,"Good thing about Marche is everyone will find something to eat.
Bad thing is it's too expensive for the the quantity of food they serve.
Infact they jave stopped serving tap water, you have to buy water which is SGD 4.20+ for 500ml.

I have visited Suntec and Harbour front Marche, but felt Harbour front is well managed.

I like the veg crepe and veg rosti with cheese. In dessert's i recommend butter bread pudding."
Customisable,The style of the restaurant was very interesting and it was very different from a usual restaurant experience. The food was very rich and good.
Strange set up,"IT'S a strange concept, with a limited but good quality menu, which you pay on a card that is swiped at each station, it's all freshly made so you may have to wait a bit, and the pizza station has a strange idea of how a pizza is made, no sauce on the base before the topping !, but great desserts, worth a visit."
Average,"The food here is not bad, but very ordinary. It is slightly on the expensive side but the ambiance is really nice especially you're having a gathering with friends. We were served cold dishes.

We told the cook that the Roasted pork belly is burning because the light is too hot, but, they are just laughing and didn't even bother to take care of their food."
Consistently delicious; love the rosti and cakes!,"I've been coming to Marche for years, and this visit did not disappoint. The rosti tasted as good as ever, as did the mushroom soup and various cakes. The ambience was rustic and charming, inviting people to sit down and relax and have a good meal."
"First experience, will come back",Great first experience. The carbonara pasta and pizza tasted amazing and the place is just great. Would love to come back another time
Not as satisfying as expected,"I love marche' and their concept. I use to visit the branch in Somerset and decided to try the one in vivo. What a disappointment with the steak. Not hygienic at all. there were some flies on the steak. Are the staff blind or what ? The lamb rack was full of flies and I just ordered the Rib eye steak since it seems okay. It taste as if the meat has been there for quite some time. For a restaurant which states ""served fresh"" I highly doubt how fresh it is. Pls do improve the cleanliness of your restaurant. We are paying customers not dogs."
Satisfactory birthday meal,"We ordered a variety of items to share. Though the food is pricey, the portion sizes are big too.
The ones I tried were the pork knuckle, beef steak, paella, rosti with smoked salmon, brownie and ice cream.

Both the pork knuckle and beef were very tender, not tough or hard to chew. Beef was cooked just right, pork knuckle was crispy on the outside.

They were quite generous with the salmon on the rosti, rosti was not burnt.
The brownie was moist and chocolaty, but I preferred the tiramisu cake we ordered afterwards.

Will definitely be back again as Marche caters to different tastes, and to some of my family members who are vegetarian/pescatarian."
busy for a reason.....,busy for a reason...even with lots of completion around it... great.... varied smorgasbord of freshly cooked [while you watch] food... and great friendly service....busy but plenty of tables......
Fabulous cakes ;) 50% off with EATIGO,"Love this place. This is the best Movenpick in Singapore (and I‚Äôve been to them all). Salmon Chowder soup, garlic bread, lamb rack, snail sausage, coarse pork sausage, strawberry cake...all for $31 !! Take a look at the pic of the deserts and tell me you‚Äôre not tempted!!"
"Good, but simple","This particular Marche is still stable in quality. However, my current impression is that it provides very primitive tastes for such high price.
Really, if you are getting Caesar salad with salmon for 20 dollars, you have the right to expect something beyond average. But... it is very very usual and average."
Such a nice place!,"I really enjoyed this restaurant!
It's a nice ambience with a lot of stations where you can find many kinds of food (like the soup station, crepe station, salad station, pasta station...). So you can choose what you want and bring it to your table with you. A great place to meet friends for a pleasant lunch or dinner."
Love this place! Can keep coming back again and again,"This is our second time to Marche having come here a few years ago with friends so we wanted to try it since we were back in Singapore. Marche did not disappoint. We received a friendly welcome and instructions on how to dine at Marche by the front staff. All the food was of the highest quality. No doubt the prices are slightly on the high side, it was worth it as we were getting freshly prepared meals with good customer service. We enjoyed the crepes and waffles. Yum, yum, yum. Looks like it's popular with families and large groups. Will definitely be back to this Marche at Vivo City the next time we are back in Singapore."
Unwind...Relax....indulge,"Marche at Vivocity is a multipurpose multi-sensory culinary experience for us; the setting is great (aim for a window-side tables) with perfect lighting, take in the welcome sounds of people talking/laughing at their tables, and you are right next to your food. You see your food being prepared/cooked/served and ...you have plenty of choices. And above all...the staff, the ever-smiling and courteous staff.
We, my teenaged son and I, have spent hours here, we have entertained many of our friends here and they all have loved it. And for us as a family, its a wonderful place to relax and have great conversations over good food.We make it a point to reach Marche by 5ish and are there until 9 or 10 pm. If you manage a table by the window, you catch the evening sky and of course the constant stream of visitors - tourists, shoppers, families,
To eat and drink, there is plenty to choose from (a little less for vegetarians), but still, the salads, crepes, pizza, pasta (I had it once and is avoidable), the rosti is heavenly, the veggies good, and then comes the desserts. You have a very wide choice to choose from - pies, pastries, ice creams etc etc. Their lemonades, fresh juices and smoothies, teas and definitely the beer....all wonderful.
The pricing is a bit on the higher side when compared to their portion sizes; the 'small' is piddly, medium is small and large is okay. But then you aren't just paying for the food here....you are paying for the whole experience."
Birthday celebration,"Good choice of foods for everyone! Especially everyone just pick what they love and shared! Good ambience, good food, good selection!"
Expensive but worth it,"Place: very comfortable and clean. The AC temp is just right.

Staff: friendly and accommodating.

Food: Awesome!!! Pizza, crepes, pasta, seafood, rosti, steaks and fabulous deserts.

Price: i find the steak and other food reasonable but I dont find the drinks to be at reasonable price. 2 drinks is equivalent to a price of a steak. Lol

Overall I enjoyed my dining experience."
Great food and choices,Having lived in Switzerland I was expecting this Movenpick like the ones back in Switzerland. Interestingly they have the same quality but a much better range of options as well as a livelier atmosphere. Recommended!
Unusual Dining Experience,"Found this to be most unusual way of ordering food as you are given a card about the size of a credit card and you then visit various food station and order and the whole lot is charged centrally.
Overall the quality of the food is very good and the system works very well."
Quirky and fun dining set up to spruce up one's gastronomic experience,"It was a first for me.

I thought it was a buffet spread when I came in but the concept was to go to your preferred stations to get your choices and they tap the rfid for every selection that you make.

I just had rosti as everyone was raving about it. I chose mushroom rag√π to go with it.

My friends had pasta, rosti, salad and paella.

The rosti serving was quite huge so i had someone to partake it with. I had a few bites of each selection that we they had.

Rosti fell below of my expectations. It was close to being called a breakfast frittata.

Perhaps the other stations serve good food but i just stuck with settling for the rosti.

An hour into the dinner, my tummy was contracting. Imminent of a loose bowel movement which was brought about by the sour cream placed atop the rosti.

That was how everything went downhill from there. Not to mention I was gonna catch a red eye flight a few hours after that dinner!

My verdict, perhaps it is worth coming back to despite the agonizing lbm i had."
Enjoyable dinner experience,"We had been to this restaurant earlier a couple of years ago and had enjoyed the experience.We went for dinner at this restaurant again last month.
This time too we had a wonderful evening. The total spread and variety of food was excellent, Even the vegetarian dishes on offer were very good.
The continental dishes were all superb.
Highly recommended!"
Indifference attitude with poor air conditioning,"We were here to celebrate my son's birthday. The table we were assigned to was by the glass panel and we were perspiring profusely while we ate. I spoke to the waitress and all she could say was that there were previous complaints. Proposed that they should at least put out stand fans for the table affected or close this section of the restaurant. My proposal was met with indifference, much to my dismay. If I had wanted to dine alfresco, I would have gone to a hawker center. My advise to those wanting to have lunch here, flatly refused a table by the glass facade.
Why would an establishment be in the f&b business if they do not even care about the comfort of its diners? And let's not even begin to talk about the quality of the food. To Marche, please do not bother about giving standard reply to my review. I write reviews on here for the benefit of others. If you guys are sincere, then let actions speak louder than words. One of my worst dining experiences yet. Not coming back ever."
Great place for anytime!,Courteous staff. Wide range of food options. Fresh and well prepared dishes. Great location. Suitable for vegetarians too.
luxury date,we really enjoyed and love this place wonderful wonderful experience we have memorable for us as well
Gr8 ambience n concept,Everything is too good to look forward at... highly recommended Enjoyed n for sure to go again .... Swiss concept of move n pick hotels
Good for a quick bite,"Pizzas, pastas,a quick bite maybe a beer. Average food but okay for a fast lunch if out shopping at Vivo- Pizzas are quite good"
Love it!,"My wife and I like to go to 313@marche at orchard there. for this time we try this branch since we went to Sentosa and on the way home. Food is always great. we ordered German platters and of course Rosti. Service was impressed me, fast and one of auntie very helpful even though it was a busy day on international day.

definitely return next time."
Great food and place to dine with family,We went to outlet in Vivo city with family. The place is very nice with some nice views. Lot of varieties to choose from at different stalls within. I luv the rosti and sausages. Overall the place is great to have a fun filled dinner with family. We tried multiple items and all were good and worth cost.
"Harbor Front Marches, incompetence showing","As a family our preferred eating spot is usually Marches. We primarily used to eat at Marches in Somerset and Suntec. We were at Vivo city on Saturday evening and decided to try it out.

While our experience with marches in Suntec and Somerset has been very good. Here the quality of the meats and crepes were quite terrible.

I had ordered a roast chicken and it was cold and not served hot. My daughters chicken breast had an overload of salt, all four of us tasted it and confirmed that; we left that plate half finished. We also ordered crepe, and it outer layers we burnt.

We came to Marches for the Swiss standard of efficiency and good dining; however what we saw in Vivo City were bumbling kitchen staff who were not adequately trained.

Hope they improve, it is an outstanding Chain, and should not be ruined by such issues"
Very poor service at the front counter,"We were there to celebrate a birthday . However , the front desk staff were not very pleasant. Halfway through the dinner my friend had to go to the toilet. When returning they stopped him from coming back in.
We were just sitting next to the counter and we don't understand why she had to be so unpleasant."
Interesting concept,"Good variety of food options.
The pork knuckle was very good. Though the gravy a little too sweet for my husbands liking. The potato rosti was good too.
I ordered a selection of vegetables. Very small plate which was supposed to be large size. Was quite expensive for $12. Very grumpy lady managing this station,
Not friendly at all.
The pizza was average.
Good play area for the kids.
The concept of charging everything to a card and paying on leaving was interesting.
Very much a mediocre experience for me. Having to order my food at the various food stations was too frustrating.i felt like i was ordering in a cafeteria..but the prices were way too high for what i ate."
"If there was an above average, but below very good I'd pick that.","I really want to like Marche, and the concept is wonderful. But there is just something that's making me not love it. Great selection of food, but there's just something missing taste wise in the dishes I've tried. Maybe just an off day? I've tried over the past few years and always enjoyed, but something has possibly changed this year and unfortunately. My friends had a good time and enjoyed their selections of the grilled chicken, calamari and rosti."
Cozy and fresh,I have been to Marche many times. I like the cozy environment and fresh food display. Nice food too and value for money. Rosti is probably the signature dish.
Delightfully Swiss,"Great Swiss fare on a relaxed setting. The interior is decorated as a rustic Swiss chalet style, complete with cable cars, ski cabins and farm house. Food is on the pricier side but there is a good variety of European and local dishes, desserts and drinks. Staff is friendly and welcoming. Marche at Vivocity remains one of our favourite restaurant in Singapore"
Weekday lunches are excellent value for money,Dependable Marche serves swiss german food for years in Singapore but it was only recently that I found out that they have lunch specials that is under S$10.
Good food! An experience not to be missed!!,"The food is preapred on the spot and that makes all the difference-fresh and nicely presented. A good range of food, with fresh juices and a tempting range of desserts make the restaurant a great place to eat out."
Nice family experience at Marche Movenpick,"Our family went here to celebrate Mother's Day and enjoyed the whole experience. Good selection of different cuisines, drinks and desserts.
Kids enjoyed the pastas and rosti with sausages followed by crepes and ice cream.
Service was prompt and courteous...we also had nice chat with Kali who was a manager there.
I would recommend a visit especially with family and we will surely be back soon!"
"Seafood Paella, Dunkel & Movenpick ice cream","Original display cooking, food counter presentations & quality, fresh products. Efficient & organized ordering cum self service system. Delicious Rotisserie, Rosti, Seafood Paella, Dunkel & Movenpick ice cream!"
Nice concept,"A very busy place but the line does move fast. Once inside many stations to choose from, so if group has diverse tastes, it's perfect to satisfy everyone. It's called Marche and has the loud marketplace feel. Had the seafood platter and it was well done with calamari, shrimps, two types of fish and salad. The salad dressing was delicious. Only choice of wine is limited and the Robert Mondavi at 68 seems overpriced but this is singapore. Will go back"
Still pretty good after all these years but more expensive,"Still good after all these years by prices have went up a few bit over the years.

Go for the crepes it filling and nice. Not worth the money to add more ingredients. If you are going with your friends just order 2 different types and share.

Deco is really beautiful. Just don't get a table near the kids playing area."
Dinner and Breakfast,"This is good value for money, if you do crave more western food then this has it.
For dinner, I had mushroom soup, steak, potatoes and vegetables and felt very full afterwards
For Breakfast, I had Eggs Benedict plus juice and coffee.
The staff are very helpful and happy to help and direct you"
Poor quality food,"Ordered the roast chicken whole for delivery. Received it warm which was nice. But that was the end any good experience. The chicken was 70% bones and 30 meat. Terrible. Such a ripoff. I never knew such a chicken existed. Marche chicken cannot compare to the one you can buy from cold storage or Nandos.

A stupid me, decided to order delivery of roast chicken again. Hoping previous one was isolated. And guess what. A really lean meat chicken with mostly bones. Ridiculous. I brought this to Marche attention international and local branch but no response.

Their arrogance and skinny chicken, puts me off completely from their overpriced self service foods."
Superb Swiss cuisine experience,"We had gone to the vivo city outlet. It's great for kids as they have a small play area. Superb roseti , crepes & waffles. They also seemed to have great pizza, salads, pasta. It can be packed so plan in advance."
Dinner was good üòä,"A good place for couples and family to eat in , order with the card at the stall inside selling drink ,dessert , salad, spaghetti and many more .good food and good service ."
Loved this place,Great food! we had such a nice roti dish here! plenty of options and quick serve. We lucky didn't have to wait too long to get a table. Everything was great! highly recommend!
What a great place,"So many food choices . Pizza, salads, sausages and meats, ice cream, deserts the list just goes on. Best place to eat in Singapore"
"If this is what Swiss/European dining is all about, count me out!","The first impression of this place is - the theme is catchy and the concept is interesting - like a marketplace for food; the variety and spread is good - rosti, paella, crepes, rotisserie, soups and salads.. in a nutshell, a neat place for Swiss/European cuisine.

But it doesn't take long for those notions to get shattered. No one cares about your seating, your food, your orders and pretty much everything else (except the bill) anyway. If you manage to hunt and wait and beg for food and manage to get it (my little daughter got hers after 40 minutes and the order was a single grilled sausage!), the crepes are awesome, the rosti, damn good, the knuckles are pretty good.

But hey, what's the big deal? So are dozens of other outlets in Singapore offering buffets, with much better taste, better value for money and the staff having much lesser (or no) snobbish attitude!

If you like dining out, you'll probably try this once for the theme and will soon realise yourself that it's not worth the hype anyway. If this is purported European dining (it's not - trust me!), I'm better off trying something else at a lunch buffet at one of the premium hotels - the price I'll be paying there is pretty much the same, but with much better service and food!"
What is with the Hype?,Nothing spectacular to merit the long queues. Expensive food. Overrated roasted food. Snobby cooks specially the one in the rotisserie section. Lady in the German Beer counter is so nice though.
Rosti is a must try here,"Nice restaurant, distinctly situated on the roof top of vivo city providing ample seating place. For us we really like Rosti and freshly prepared pizza. Nice healthy salad options customized as per your requirement. The look and feel of the place is intriguing with lots of options to choose from. There is a small play area for the kids to keep busy. Overall the staff is good and welcoming."
Quite a different dining experience‚Ä¶,"This is our second visit to this establishment. We chanced upon this restaurant the first time, tried it and simply quite loved it. The restaurant employs a marketplace concept, where there are stalls within the central isle of the restaurant serving mainly Italian and European cuisine. You are issued a card that is used to record all the purchases that you made as you walk around trying to decide what you want to eat. There are confectioneries, salads and soup, pizza and pasta, grill section, paella etc. The station with the longest queue is usually the Swiss R√∂sti, it may look like an unassuming simple dish, but pair it with a sausage and you have a tasty and satisfying dish.

The restaurant‚Äôs interior d√©cor makes it look a bit like a market, with a touch of European style to it. It can get quite crowded at times, and the tables and spaced rather intimately, so you do get an environment of being in a market. The food is quite good, the environment is lively, price is errr‚Ä¶ medium by Singaporean standards, and you ought to give it a try when you are in Vivocity."
First visit to this Marche brach,"Staff was friendly at the front counter but due to public holiday food ( roast chicken and red onion pizza) was a 25 min wait.

Tables and environment was clean as usual like other branches in singapire.

Quality of food:
Pizza (roast chicken and red onion)
Don't know if I'm lucky or what but most piece of chicken on the pizza was on one side and also extra fattie.
Chicken cubes tasted like off cuts. Bit disdapointed. I how the management can follow up because other foods departments looks very nice."
