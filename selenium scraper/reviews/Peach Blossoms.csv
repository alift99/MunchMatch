"One of the best Dim Sum Singapore has to offer, helmed by award winning chef","Ate here a couple of times and my oh my, am I blown away but the quality of their dim sum. Food was enjoyable, clean and modern Chinese restaurant. Their Dim Sum ranges from several staples and chef inspired versions which are very unique.

If you are first timers to Dim Sum or travellers from a distant land, I will recommend you to try other restaurant that serves more traditional options before experiencing the difference here."
Very condescending staff,Very condescending staff at the door. Not a hint of warmth. Such a mis-representation of the Singaporean hospitality.
Absolutely amazing,"An absolute amazing dinner. Every dish was not only delicious, but also presented very nicely. Perfect service. Can only highly recommend this wonderful restaurant. Thanks for a beautiful evening!!!"
Chinese fine dining go-to-restaurant,"If you ever feel like eating chinese food and have a fine-dining experience, this is your go-to-place.

In most cases you only care about the taste when it comes to chinese food, but Peach blossoms managed to please our eyes the whole time, while maintaining the palatable taste."
Hit-and-Miss Quality with Long Wait,"Family dinner. The Peking duck and sweet and sour pork (not pictured) took 30 minutes to be served and the rest of the dish like the Abalone, Crab Claw and oil socked Soon Hock took another 2 hours of waiting. For the price and the time waiting, the quality was subpar as the appetite was gone during the long long wait …"
Very attractive restaurant,"We did not eat there as it was not open during our stay. We had a wander through and it was very smart, clean and had a wonderful menu. It has won many awards and looks like the place to hold a function or for a special occasion."
"Wonderful food, Good Ambiance","Excellent Chinese food with wonderful food display. Portions were not big but reasonable. Serves in fine dining style, the food was tasty. We had an appetizer, a soup, one meat dish, a cod fish dish and noodle dish as main course. Noodle was unique as it was made from flour & fish paste. The dessert was dragon fruit with ice cream & sago was wonderfully done as a finale.

Very good restaurant"
"Most lovely Cantonese cuisine, much more sophisticated than the past","I haven’t visited peach blossoms since after this hotel (used to be mandarin) changed to parkroyal collections, so I was quite thrilled to be invited here for dinner this evening. What a massive change! The decor is much more modern, though it retains an oriental background still.

The food was not only exquisitely and beautifully presented, it was overall very delicious. I must say I have never been more impressed by char siew (it was already bursting with aroma even BEFORE the waiter created the flames) - and the cuts of meat came with a lovely thin top of fat, and it’s skin was caramelised crispy. Simply heavenly! I have also never been more amazed to eat the spring roll - shaped and presented like a cigar, which I was secretly expecting a flame too haha. The deep fried fish, though I’m not a fan, was lovingly prepared with some purplish petals atop a corrugated crispy skin. Crab claw hor fun was amazing! Even the dessert, a common mango purée, was delightful.

Service was attentive inside the restaurant. I was disappointed by the two staff at the entrance - I was early and stood outside the restaurant, and when they opened the restaurant they didn’t invite me inside to sit. They just stood there, chatting away. That was most unwelcoming. I’m deducting one star for that.

I will surely return! Hopefully no more unwelcoming staff at the door."
"Impressive Chinese food, with twists","This was my first time here. The food and plating were mind-blowing, and every dish has its own unique flavour. But the meal doesn't come cheap, so do be prepared. #choowai2022 #wongchoowaieats #wongchoowai #crawfurd #crawfurdhospital #plumblossom #sgfoodshare #sgfoodinfluencers #covi̇d19 #dinning #sgfoodbloggers #sgfoodshare"
Artistic Food,"Every dish is presented like an art piece. Remarkable food. Handful of must order dishes like deep fried ‘cigar’, stewed mung bean noodle crab, 4 combination platter. Soup of the day is a must too! Restaurant Manager Lee’s was all smiles despite a full house on a weeknight and spent time explaining the dishes to us. Had an awesome time at Peach Blossom with my friends. TIP, pre-order your food to prevent disappointment!"
Always a delightful gastronomic journey.,Young and promising Chef Edward (btw I dunno him personnally by saw him a couple of times) and his team are creative in their cuisine and at the same time provide a gastronimic culinary experience. Even as the front of house is very short handed. They still tried their best to cater to every request Kudos.
Excellent Food,"The food and the service were excellent. However, they took a long time to bring the dessert. We had a special menu, and I can't explain everything that was on it. Lots of crab, some beef, and seafood. Excellent presentation. Exquisite flavour"
Exquisite and Delicious!,"Had a really enjoyable and exquisite lunch at Peach Blossoms. I think it is Michelin standard to be honest. The ambience was great and the service was amazing.

Our server Vincent gave really good recommendation for the dishes as well as the number of dishes to order! He actually stopped me when I wanted to order more and we were so glad he did because this was likely the first time we didn’t over order and were adequately full.

Here are my highlights in no particular order as all the dishes were flavourful and delicately presented.
Four combination platter - this one gave me the Michelin feel! Impressed and must order.
King Prawns with Korean Glass Noodle and Lemongrass - flavourful
Applewood Smoked Jamon Iberico Pork Char Siew - this is to die for. MUST ORDER.
Simmered Homemade Fish Paste with Luffa Gourds and Surf Clams - light and delicious.
Steamed Kurobuta Pork with Prawns (SiewMai) - I might be biased because I am a SiewMai lover but this is really good!
Soups were all good so just listing them here:
Double-boiled Yunnan Wild Mushroom with Sea Whelk, Dried Scallops and Kurobuta Ribs
Shun De Thick Broth with Dried Scallops and Homemade Fish Paste
Seafood Dumpling with Abalone in Lobster Essence

We enjoyed everything and would likely go again for any special occasion! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
Fair prices and worth a visit,"Restaurant and hotel are newly renovated and the ambience/design is refreshing/nice break from the city. The dim sum menu is limited (we only had one order of har gaw and it was nothing special) while the main dishes were largely hit and miss. The dishes were cooked largely in the same manner and style -definitely not on par with Summer Pavilion at the Ritz near by. However, prices are accordingly more reasonable so it’s balanced that way! Service was just OK, apart from the host who was really friendly. I would say it’s worth going once for the experience but I’m not racing to go back."
Worst CNY Dinner Ever,"Priced 3 to 4 times that of regular dinner but served mediocre food. Worst CNY raw fish dish ever, other dishes were embarrassing in quality, presentation and overall negligence . We want a refund."
Exquisite yet accessible,Lived up to the hype. Its what the reviewers here have said. Will definitely return to try other dishes.
Chinese,"Stayed at the parkroyal marina bay and had dinner and lunch here. The food in general is very good, as is the service. The lobster noodles per person is a generous portion compared to other places. Should get a michelin star as it’s better than most of the starred ones"
Feast to the eyes and stomach!,"Nice ambience and exquisitely presented food. Must try: four combination platter, with 4 different appetizers presented in an artistic way. Taste was superb. Must try soups: ‘Shun De’ Thick Broth with Dried Scallops and Homemade Fish Paste and Seafood Dumpling with Abalone in Lobster Essence. The former has a thick nice broth while the latter, as the name suggest has the essence of the lobster very much like a lobster bisque. The seafood dumpling was big with lots of seafood goodness. Definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in Singapore ."
Good and affordable dinner,"First visit, ordered the sea perch with duo mushroom sauce and wasabi prawn, both were equally good. For SGD 26 you get 7 or 8 big prawns, really a good deal. Good service from the staff."
You deserve the stars,"Going by the recent lunch here, it’s unfathomable Michelin stars haven’t been bestowed on it, The visually stunning applewood smoked char siew, and the crab claw Japanese noodles with seafood broth served in coconut are sublime. Kudos to Chef Edward and team!"
Good food with nice ambiance,"After renovation, the place looks bright and spacious. Ordered the soup of the day and it’s heavenly. The roast pork could be better. Overall it is very good and highly recommended. The staff is attentive and helpful and recommended some good dishes."
Good Food and Service,I was invited here for lunch and it is my first time to come here. I would like to compliment the food especially the roasted duck and the soup. I’m not a fan of duck and thought that I would prefer the pork but it end up to be the other way around. The service rendered by Yong Zhe was great too. He had total of 6 tables in his section when I was there but he didn’t fail to clear and check on our table. I will definitely bring my whole family or friends here next time if I got the chance cause feasting with more than 2 persons will definitely be a better experience so we could be able to try more varieties as we ended up getting full immediately as there is only 2pax allowed per table. Till the next time.
Pieces of art,"Every dish is literally a piece of art. It was truly an amazing dining experience. Not only were the food presentation breathtaking, they tasted as good as well. Thank you very much for the amazing dinner!"
Nice Dinning Experience,"We had a delightful evening on 27 September dinning at Peach Blossoms.
Our order of Gastronomic Set Menu was very tasty and creative!
Kudos to young and affable Executive Chef Edward Chong!
Both Nobel Chang (Asst Manager) and Mun Fung were attentive and friendly.
Will definitely come back again!"
Fantastic dinner,"Cantonese food is about creativity, taste, visual and texture. Peach Blossoms did not fail in all aspects.

Kudos to the chef for all the above. Service was impeccable. Staff were knowledgeable. Orders were expertly taken. Was amaze at the speed the food was serve to each table. No rush but clockwork pace and regularity.

Price was good. For all you see in my pictures = S$200"
Exquisite,I had my birthday dinner here today and wanted to give a shoutout to our server Mun Fung :) you made our evening very special!
Great food and service,"My second time visiting the restaurant, on the back of a recommendation of a friend. The food was excellent, especially the smoked char siu, while service was top notch. Will definitely go back, and in fact already have that booking made!"
Delicious food. Reasonably priced.,"Did not book but managed to get a table. But had to finish within an hour which is no issue. Ordered some dim sum, starter was abalone with caviar.. peking duck, lobster soup... they were great. No complaints! Wished we could order more dishes to try but we were small eaters. Will be back next time."
Dining in at Peach Blossom,Good food and excellent service! The beef cubes are very good and more importantly the service provided is top notch
Excellent food at a price,"Had discovery set meal as part of the hotel's 100% ""cashback"" dining credits deal.

Food was spectacular and blew our minds. Can't find a single fault in the food. Plating was excellent as well, using a variety of oriental designs.

Staff were extremely detailed and paid attention to all of our needs. We were quiet customers so they didn't entertain us, but the other 2 tables were well entertained by the staffs. The executive chef came out several times too to make sure everyone is happy (its a quiet night)

Complementary birthday cake too (with reservations) which was well played and taste excellent"
Great food and great ambiance,"This is the third time I have eaten here and I am very satisfied! Great food and great ambiance overall. The chef’s cooking method is very innovative and the taste is superb! All the waitresses and waiters and in particular, Nobel and Sun Jing are helpful and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend my friends to dine here!"
Exceptional and delicious,"The restaurant is beautifully set up and the service was impeccable (limited dining to two probably helped!). Had dimsum there and this is the best dim sum I have tried so far in Singapore. The Chee cheongfun was soft and pillowy, the fish porridge was simply divine and presentation was spot on. Would definitely go back"
Will come back again.,"Thanks apple and liew , the staff and manager provide good service and very knowledge in the menu. Staff Apple provide a good recommendation in food, Manager Liew give good explanation in food. Thanks both of them."
Nice Chinese Food Experience,Recommended by our local friend and we decided to treat ourselves with fine Chinese cuisine and we were not disappointed. Refined Chinese cooking and presentation. Great Service.
Nice Food and Great Service,Was there last week. Great recommendations from Manager Yong Zhe especially the Applewood Smoked Iberico Pork Char Siew and Cigar Roll. We really enjoy the good service rendered by Manager Yong Zhe and his team. Thank you and will be back soon.
I would love to give a min,"I would love to give a min 4 stars if it’s based on food quality only. But because this is a 5-star hotel, it needs to be rated holistically.
1. Cleanliness of utensils
Really disappointed with the cleanliness of the utensils. The teacup, bowl and plate all had stains that could be wiped away if the staff had cleaned the utensils properly. A big no-no for a reputable Chinese restaurant a 5-star hotel. Take a leaf from Mandarin Oriental & Pan Pacific - their utensils cleanliness are good . Really really unacceptable in my opinion. Gave my feedback to the male manager who acknowledged it.

2. Food quality
four happiness platter , dim sum artistry, cheong fun , char siew bao and the lobster dumpling was outstanding. Skip the xiao long bao and the crab claw- taste is so-so.
Will be back for the rest of dim sum items - I just hope the restaurant buck up on their cleanliness of their utensils."
Great food and service,Visited Peach Blossom for friend’s birthday. Impressed by the quality of food and service. Mr Sun Jing provided us excellent service. Manager Yong Zhe’s recommendation was just nice and good. Will definitely revisit again.
"Nice place for Asian food lovers, excellent service","Food very nice. Celebrated friends birthday there, very good experience. Thanks to Sun Jing and Manager Yong Zhe for the arrangement. Everything perfect 🤩"
Exquisite food menu and great service always.,"Have visited Peach Blossoms umpteen times and am always surprised with their exquisite items on the menu. Ordered appetiser cigar roll and the platter, presentation was elegantly presented and the food was really special. Service was also great and my friends and I will definitely be back again."
Its a longgg wait,"I have selected Peach Blossom for an intimate celebratory dinner after our solemnization, because we have attended a friend's wedding 2 years back and the food was superb.
However, it wasn't the case this time round and the celebratory dinner was filled with disappointments and bad impression for my relatives.

With the restaurant newly opened after an extensive renovation of the entire hotel, we were excited to try out the new menu.

1. Long serving time.
Time interval between the 1st to 3rd dish was 1 hour, waiting time was around 30 min per dish, subsequent 3rd-8th dish was served more quickly and the entire 8 course dinner took ~2.5 hours.
Granted it was a friday night but the waiting time was too long. But there was no explanations given, or pre-empt us of the delay. We were just waiting, and waiting.

2. Sub par quality of food
With this price tag, and with the past wedding experience, we had high expectations.
We ordered the 'Wellness' set menu, there were hits and misses, certain dishes such as the Double boiled seawhelk soup and wok fried multi grain rice was good. However the rest of the dishes range from normal to sub par.

Some dishes such as the the steamed sea perch was extremely salty,
Double-boiled Snow Swallow with Peach Gum and Red Dates had all the ingredients boiled until it dissolved in liquid form (which could be their way or preparation),
all other dishes tasted normal, just like what you can get in a normal cantonese restaurant, without the expensive price tag.

3. Service: 5 star
There was a middle age lady who took my reservation and followed through during the 8 course dinner, she was really helpful, courteous, and attentive to our needs.

All this has been feedback to the restaurant at the end of dinner.
All in all, the celebratory dinner was almost ruined, with the long waiting time for my guest and the normal quality of food. I dont think I would return again, neither would my guest too.

Note: At the end of 8 dishes, we had plans to go for a second meal elsewhere because the portion was really small."
"Great Ambience, Impeccable Service, Good Food",This is my first visit to Peach Blossom after its renovation last December. The restaurant was given a complete makeover with modern decoration and finishing. A very comfortable feeling walking into the restaurant. Food was great and so was the service. Our waiter was Mr Sun Jing and gave us great recommendations on the food. My friends and I had a wonderful time and an enjoyable evening. It was truly an experience dining at Peach Blossom. We are definitely going back soon.
Delicious food and wonderful staff,"One of the best dinning experience we had during our stay. The food were delicious and the services rendered by the team of staff were impeccable. We felt warm and welcome by the staff instantly and certainly enjoyed our meal there. Our compliments to Mun Fung, Bowie, Ivy, Sun Jing, Sok Teng and Roger. We highly recommend a visit if you have not been before. Their signature dishes that we savored and really enjoyed include the ‘Four combination platter’, the ‘applewood smoked iberico pork char Siew’ and roasted duck were delectable."
Mum’s 80th birthday lunch,We were very well taken care of. Food was excellent and service was impeccable. Bowie who assisted us with the order was outstanding. Mum and her siblings enjoyed the experience. Thank you Bryan for making the arrangements.
Great service n food,"First time having dinner with my family here. Impressed with the food and the level of service....
Staff assisted in my ordering and we like a couple of their signature dishes, like 'cigar' roll and A4 wagyu beef and snow crab fried rice.
Thank you Yong Zhe for being so welcoming and the waitress who was serving our table. Excellent dining experience."
Great food Great Taste,Had a great & wonderful evening at Peach Blossom. The food are wonderful and well balanced in taste.
Excellent food and service,Great food served from the chef and Zong Che really served us so well... well-done and keep up the good work
Good experience,"Except the long waiting to be seated, food was well done, staff were friendly. The cigar roll was special"
Birthday 🥳 Meal,"We had the beef wagyu, salted egg prawns, mapo tofu, superior stock vermicelli, roast pork, yummy sweet pork and best of all sour-spicy soup.

Five stars for the sour-spicy soup. A favourite of mine!

Service was friendly but it was crowded. Service staff tells me they are slightly understaffed and apologize for some wait time but we were comfortable and happy. So much so that we sat for more than an hour and didn't realized the time.

Will be back ☺️"
"Great, nice food and service","Thank you Roger (Restaurant Manager) for assisting me to make a food menu for my daughter’s belated birthday dinner at Peach Blossoms. The food presentation looks very pretty and they tasted marvelous, yummy! My daughter and son-in- law loves it very much. A great thank you and thumb up to Chef Edward and his Culinary Teams. Again, thank you to Nobel with her attentiveness service even though the restaurant was busy. Well done, ladies & gentlemen. Keep up the good job!"
CNY Gathering,Chef Edward Chong never fail to surprise me and my family and friends with his creative & delish food presentation.
Dinner,Chef Edward specially whipped up this dinner for us. The deep fried cigar rolls is really nice. The portions are just nice and the service is really good!
Awesome food,"Chef Edward’s presentation of food was awesome and definitely made the experience even better. Nice food, great ambience with friendly service!"
Review of food and service,"Went to Peach Blossom to celebrate my wife birthday and our 29th Anniversary, food was great,especially the the signature dish *Char Siew""! The service from Roger Yeo is wonderful,he is warm and friendly, highly recommended and I will definitely make a revisit woth my family soon."
Great service and great food!,Great atmosphere and service by restaurant manager Roger. Food has plenty of flavour and depth. Will return again
Favourite restaurant,"Always a restaurant we would go for any celebration or just a chance to indulge in great Cantonese food with creative twist.
Here with the family to celebrate Chinese New Year and everyone was wowed all over again by the wonderful service, and lovely food starting with our fruit yu Sheng.
Thanks to Roger, Alden and team for taking care of us !"
best chinese restaurant and best chef in singapore,"chef edward ， 佩服他的厨艺 ， 出神入化。
special and fantastic food.
smoked duck , char siew , caviar fried rice and so on"
Good food and excellent services.,Good food and excellent services. Very nice ambience. Very nice Lo-hei. Friendly Outlet Manager Roger Yeoh!
Art of Cantonese Cuisine and outstanding service,"We were anticipating the Peach Blossoms' reopening since December and read many great reviews since then. With the Life and Style, by Meritus discount benefits, it was just like double happiness for us.

Our lunch and dinner here were just full of surprises, as classical dishes were transformed into creative and artful presentations.

We tried the signature dishes, dim sum and the desserts. Highly recommended to pre-order the signature roasted dishes - Flambee Chinese Wine Spring Chicken and Sugarcane Smoked Kurobuta Pork Ribs. There are many varieties of chinese tea and I've tried the Dragon Pearl and Bi Luo Chun.

Besides the food, the outstanding service from all the staff can hardly go unnoticed. We were very well taken care of, from the reservation (phone/online form) to the best table assignment (window seat requested and given) and the food recommendation/serving. This is by far the best customer service we've experienced in hotel restaurants in Singapore. There wasn't a moment that our wine glasses or teapot were empty. The staff were super-attentive at every moment and whenever we ask about any dishes, they were very well-trained in explaining the ingredients, preparation and serving method. They even noted that I like taking pictures/videos, so they would wait I was ready before starting the flambee. Special thanks to Mr. Roger and Ms. Swee Teng for taking good care of us during our dinner on Friday, 29th January. Such level of professionalism is very commendable and should be the benchmark to all restaurants. Kudos to the Management team!

We will gladly return, not just for the amazing food but most of all for the service that made us feel very much at home and as the valued customers."
Dim sum with a modern twist,"Located at the newly launched Parkroyal collection on Marina Bay , this Chinese restaurant adds a modern twist to your run of mill dim sum or yum cha. Beautifully presented and plated. The service staff were attentive and helpful. We will be back for more!"
Refreshing Chinese dining experience,Celebration dinner for 8 pax tis evening at Peach Blossoms. Food was marvellous with several wows and awesome presentation. Many thanks to Alden for customising the menu based on our budget. Highly recommended 👍
Creative chef with great food,"Saw some of friends visited restaurant, we also want to try. Finally we made it on Boxing Day. Chef Edward is so professional and creative. He takes care of each guests in the restaurant. She shared his idea on how to create his dishes. We had a great time there. Thanks for hotel manager Mr. Damian Tan for your hospitality too! We will come back soon!"
Impeccable dining experience!,"Definitely a most memorable and elevated meal experience! Food presentation was incredible (lots of surprise elements) combined with excellent flavours and use of ingredients. For a foodie, this restaurant is highly recommended. Service was super on point too. Experiential dining that satisfy all senses!"
A Meal taken to the next level! Overall experience is superb!,"A friend organised this get together dinner for a party of five and I was really not expecting much out of it. But this restaurant has definitely exceeded all my expectations. The presentation delivery of every dish is impeccable. It shows the team behind would just want to get every guest in awe with their attention to details, taste and flavours. A must-try dish is the special spring roll with foi gras and shrimps that was presented like a cigar. Totally blown away...

Lastly, the service is fantastic. I have to say one must have a steady hand to serve with all the exquisite presentation on hand to each guest. A must-go place if you are looking for great Chinese"
Peach Blossoms reopens with Cantonese Cuisine Reimagined! Kudos to the creativity and passion by the team!,"The waits is over! Finally Peach Blossoms is reopens! The restaurant is enhanced by its rejuvenated space that features light woods, nature-inspired palette and a touch of oriental. We had set lunch that specially curated by Chef Edward Chong, accompanied with champagne and red wines that highly recommended by Calven. Thanks Calven, Alden and Sook Teng at our service with attentiveness.

Must try dishes:
- Dim Sum Artistry - Steamed Scallop Dumpling/ Steamed Crystal Dumpling/ Steamed Squid Ink Seafood Dumpling with Three Types of Tobiko
- Seafood Fritters filled with Lychee and Cheese (the ones look like Lychee!)
- ‘Shun De’ Thick Broth with Dried Scallops and Homemade Fish Paste (My friend loved this soup!)
- Sugarcane Smoked Kurobuta Ribs (I loved the collagen and smoky taste)
- Fresh Prawn in Supreme Rice Broth served with Puffed Rice

Kudos to the culinary and service team who enlivens our afternoon so wonderful today!"
Awesome Lunch !!,"21 Dec 2020 Xmas + 冬至lunch gathering catch up with 5 Kaki. Special awesome set lunch by Chef Edward Chong , pair with & champagne at new Peach Blossom today! Must Thanks Chef who surprised us with the Progressive Cantonese Cuisine Reimagined We loved the new concept and the display of food and service!"

Re-opened!,"Had lunch here! Got a great dining experience thanks to the staff Jeff’s great service! Lobster Noodle and Abalone Lobster Bisque Soup were superb! The stock was thick and you can taste the essence of the lobster meat!

Definitely a great dining experience!"
"DRAB ""Disinterested"" SERVICE","I was invited here for dinner.

Suckling pig and steamed fish were outstanding.

The other dishes were acceptable and forgettable.

Service was adequate, but staff were ""lifeless"" with an aura of jaded disinterest, just doing a job and waiting to pack up before 10pm.

Their faces lit up when the Bill was asked for and ""all life returned"".

Regrettably, this drab service atmosphere is now associated with their name."
Ridiculous reservation experience that keeps canceling on you,"Booked through quando to reserve available slots yesterday and today only to receive a cancellation notice from the restaurant..same response over phone that restaurant is also fully booked tmw. I find it unbelievable given that this is low period where restaurants are supposedly impacted by coVid-19 and hotels fnb outlets are screaming for assistance from government. The lady who took the phone Irene if I rem correctly didn't even bother to offer alternative slots and was unapologetic in her cold awkward apology and the hint was don't ever reserve anything cos after tmw will be undergoing renovation, and I gotta probe for when the restaurant would be open. This is the first restaurant that cancels reservations consecutively online for time slots deemed available. Suggest the new hotel management seriously looks into improving into the whole online and customer experience. Even a low end restaurant can do better than you"
DINNER,Overall experience is pleasant. Tomahawk is not bad. Service is a bit slow as we waited for 30mins before food is served. Home made tofu is nice but salty. Other dishes taste normal
What happened to Peach Blossoms?,"We came here for dinner on 29 February 2020, with 3 very young children and 6 adults.

It was not the first time i came, but it would likely be the last time i would dine here.

I am always wowed and amazed at the service and the quality of the food. But it was all disappointment on Saturday.

Food we ordered took really long to come. Drinks we ordered took so long to come despite reminders (""my colleague is picking it up""), and it only came after we got another waitress to cancel the order.

Our table's waiting staff was terrible. It felt like we owe her money, and she was unhappy about us asking for more chilli padi. The amount they gave for the first two servings was terrible. We are a table for 6 adults and yet you provide us with sufficient for only maybe 2 adults. And when we asked for more, she exclaimed, ""Not enough meh?"" And came back to take the saucer as if to check if we had finish our chilli padi before asking for more.

It was such a painful dining experience that we really do not look forward to having dinner there again."
What happened?,"For years Peach Blossom was up there as a small eating establishment sitting in a 5 star hotel. The standard be it food taste, service were always top notch. You would hardly find the chance of having a seat as a walk in. Today it all changed.

I was aiming to go to hai tien lo but ended up here, very lucky I thought to have gotten a seat at 1pm on a Sunday, be it due to covid or just empty I was excited to be there.

We opted for alacarte ordered around 7 dimsum items, a fried rice and and vegetarian dish. Firstly, food was being served so slowly, we sat between two tables one an elderly couple and a Taiwanese family. Everyone was grumbling about how slow service was. First dish was the kurobuta cheese pork bun came 20mins after ordering, then the next 3 came 15 mins later and another 3 came 15mins later. Then came the crucial point,, we ordered the kurobuta upon finishing the first serving within first 5mins when served only to found out it has been sold out after enquiring where were my fried rice and tofu. That is atrocious, imagine you ordered something, orders logged for 35mins only to found out its out of stock, imagine if I didn't ask! I wouldn't know it was not even coming, the fried rice was the same we overhear the Taiwanese family asking to cancel only then did they get serious and wants to cook it, I did the same to cancel it.

And look at last two photos the 3 dimsum item was finished for nearly 30mins and no one cleared the empty dishes even the final vegetarian dish was served. When questioned why is things taking so long today, are you understaffed or new? They replied oh too many customers, oh well the restaurant was hardly 60%fulll. The strangest thing is they told us and the Taiwanese family that xiaolongbao and baked cheese pork bun was out of stock but we hardly see anyone coming in. And we were only told that when we ask what's left on our orders that hasn't come.

They even served our food to the wrong table! Well don't get me wrong customer service was not the super best but I would say they tried very hard to please so there is nothing wrong with waiting staffs. The kitchen seems to be the culprit causing all that ruckus.

Food overall was tasty, saltiness everything was at the right notch. I sincerely hope the management reads this and will try to sort this out as it is not good for your restaurant reputation, the food standards are still there but minute things like put of stock at 1230 to 1pm on a Sunday, waiters do not know that, and miscommunication with kitchen that just isn't the best for all.

Unsure if it's because parkroyal took over to have caused this but I believe it's a one off.

Please do something about it."
Not the most customer friendly,"Food was so-so. Mostly just enjoyed the old cucumber seafood soup. The rest were generally overpriced and the red bean pancake was too thick and flour undercooked.

Worst of all, after spending $400, only 1 carpark coupon was allowed."
Having read all the reviews,"Having read all the reviews ( can’t believe their all genuine) decided to dine here this evening. We waited a full hour to receive any kind of food and although they advertise a gluten free choice they are about as clued up in this regards as asking a child to fly a plane.
The price of an average bottle of wine is over £45 and the service is at best sloppy and I cannot understand their certificate of excellence . In my mind if you dine frequently in Chinese UK restaurants this place is way below the standard of even a modest uk restaurant . The food when it arrived was good but the trauma and the wait was way below the level that should qualify as a trip advisor quality site."
Highly recommended!! Incredible,Highly recommended!! Incredible traditional Chinese restaurants. The prawns were amazing! Will be coming back. Went as a couple but would be great for big group dinners as well.
Anniversary dinner,"My wife and I went to the Peach Blossoms Restaurant on the 5th floor for dinner this evening to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Both Assistant Managers Vivian and Terry went out of their way to make the evening special for us by their personal attention and service. Terry even rushed to hand make a miniature garden with love swans made of clay and flour for us! It was lovely!
It is the personal touch of staff like Vivian and Terry which makes a huge difference to guests’s dining experience. Of course, as usual, the food quality and presentation were par excellent. We will keep coming back!"
Expensive,"We went here thinking it would bea fine dining experience, but left feeling that it was just an expensive meal.
We chose an option with 5 courses and three matching wines.
Unfortunately there was a hair in my starter, I felt the beef steak in one course was overcooked and the red wine for that course wasn't poured until we'd nearly finished.
The courses also came far too quickly after each other and we had to ask the staff to slow down, although by then it was really too late.

For our menu choice, it came to SGD $220 per person, which I felt didn't represent good value unfortunately."
Excellent service and good food,"I recently visited Peach Blossoms Restaurant again and I was impressed with the service given by the staff Bowie, Ivy and Sook Teng. I regularly visit Peach Blossoms with my family and I have never been disappointed with the food served and the service given (friendly staff).I will specially recommend the passionfruit prawns and waygu beef cubes with longan."

Dinner Again @ Peach Blossoms!,"I always look forward to having dinner at Peach Blossom at Marina Mandarin. I lost count of how many times I have visited the restaurants in the past 2 years. The menu selection is good and I notice there are changes in the menu in the past 2 years. The food quality is excellent and style of cooking to my liking.
Menu and food quality aside, most importantly it's the service that create the overall dining experience.
I would like to commend the service staffs (Nobel, Alden, Bowie, Sook Teng, Jeff and Vivian) for their attention to details and their welcoming smile. Also notice their refreshing look when we chatted with them when they drop by my table to say hello."
Great service,"Great service by Terry- went there for my parent’s birthday celebration and he went the extra mile, helping to decorate the birthday cake and making sure our every need was taken care of. 5 stars!"

Grandma birthday celebration,"Went There to celebrate my grandma birthday and the food was extraordinary , the view was great and the Food was good . The ambience was just perfect with the decor of the restaurant as well ..Service stuff was quick and efficient to get us a table. So there was virtually no waiting time . Their manager , Alden , came to give his wishes and suggest to us what was their signature dishes and popular dishes which i thought was very kind of him . The chef was very creative with his dishes such as infusing different types of cusine ( Japanese , American ) into chinese dishes .Not many chef does that in Singapore ."

Best Chinese restaurant I know!,"Always love the food here! My favourite is the poached cod in Chinese rice wine but what makes the place worth coming over and over again is the service. Special thanks to Terry, the amazing asst manager who always makes us feel like we are kings and queens! :)"
Good all round,"We came as a family of four for weekend lunch. The restaurant was full and although we had a reservation we waited for 10 mins. Staff was generally courteous but a little harried. Ambience was warm and the quality of food was very good but not extraordinary. The steam prawns were fresh, aubergines came stuffed with prawns in a nice thick sauce. The sweet and sour pork was however a tad too sweet for me. Rib of Lamb was done just nice and Wagyu cubes succulent. A generally satisfying lunch."
