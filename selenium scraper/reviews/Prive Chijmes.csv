Great service! Wonderful staff,Staff were helpful and friendly. Celebrated my husband's birthday. Wasn't expecting a complimentary slice of cake. Also the Polaroid photo and birthday card were a surprise. Adds a personalised touch. We had the slipper lobster pasta and impossible mushroom burger which were not bad. The green tea latte was a little too bitter for our liking though. Tiramisu cake was delicious!
Review for Prive,"My 10 friends n I were at Prive Chijmes last nite . Nandhini was attending to us n she was very friendly n forthcoming .
We were all impressed by her attitude n will definitely go back , having had a wonderful time celebrating 2 friends anniversaries . We were very delighted by the service provided.
Thank u Prive , I shall recommend this place to all my other friends too ."
Dinner on 14 Jan,Ambiance is good and food is good too! Vegetarian friendly as it has quite a few options. There’s happy hour drinks too. Advice to make reservation as can be quite full during weekend.
Good service,"RAJ is really friendly to us. My meal was so perfect. Thank you guys at the restaurant. If i come to singapore again, i will visit this place again!"
"Good location, friendly and helpful staff, good food.",It was a really hot day but plenty of under cover seating with fans. Staff were helpful and friendly. Excellent food.
Drinks outside,"Haphazard service and almost no drinks without alcohol... are you still in the 20th century? Staff is friendly but so to see mostly young, new and inexperienced. Ambiance is ok but not special"
Amazing Service and very pleasant crew,"We had a very pleasant dinner at the place, the service crew was top notch. The team helped us with all our requests and set the Birthday cake for us.

Kj was very friendly and helpful, he went an extra mile to help us get a good family picture.

Will definitely come back !"
We'll be back,"Looking forward to go back. Nice food, great ambience, good price. Just that the web ordering was very slow. Hope this can be improved. Thank you for the birthday cake. :)"
Family Outing,It was overall good especially the Jim Beam with cranberry. The satay was tender and peanut sauce good. However the dead potted plant @ our table was a sore thumb! Table presentation including potted plants are important aesthetically.
Good time.,"We had nasi goreng and green curry, they were delcious. We had dark choc brownies with nuts, it was very good and not sweet. The staff were friendly and approachable, although very busy, they were always polite. Some reviewers describe this place as romantic, we thought it was normal. Parking charges were $13, we were there from 6pm till 10-ish. We had a great time!"
Poor service,"The staff was not accommodating at all. We ordered 2 cocktails for happy hour and requested that our 2nd drink was brought to us a bit later and the staff refused to cooperate.

Lastly the bill was brought to us when we had not even finished our dinner. We were intending on ordering dessert but the staff came and just dumped the bill on the table without even asking us if we had a last order request.

Do not wish to return to Chijmes Prive for this reason."
"Delicious Food, Huge Portions, Great Vibes","Food was served fairly quickly after ordering. Highly recommed the Fish & Chips, commonly found in most eateries but this is one of the best. Despite the Friday night crowd, staff were attentive and quick to replenish our drinking water."
Don’t order the eggs!,"Great position and we found service quick. But three of us had eggs - and they all came out cold. What’s with that? After we sent back orders three times - yes, three times - we gave up and left. Each tend thr poached eggs were stone cold. When we asked how that could be, the waiters explained the eggs were cooked in advance and then placed in a fridge. When orders are filled, the eggs are “warmed up” from the fridge with hot water! Crazy stuff - and, as we discovered, a hopeless result. Who wants cold runny poached eggs… three times in a row?"
Pity…,"Very good ambiance: music, deco and place but the service!…We came with our 2 daughters: the 1st plate arrived just 3 min after our order while no drinks were already served and we were waiting for the plate 15 min more…"
Rude and Impatient Manager,Here today at 29 Oct at 9.30pm. Maybe a bad day for the manager but he was so rude and impatient. This is the Worst prive branch ever visited.
It was ok,The atmosphere was nice but the food was only so so. I had the fish and chips and it got soft very quickly and the chips were actually fries and over fried and slightly too greasy. My friend order a can of coke and it took three orders and long wait to finally get it. They missed it the first time round and only put the order in at the second and at the third tell us it cannot be expedited because there is a queue even though they missed the order the first time round.
Very slow service,"Waiters very slow, never coming to the table and even when calling them they were unresponsive. The restaurant wasn’t even busy. On top of that they were not friendly at all."
Thanks to Ms. Dini,"Great place to be, Prive Chijmes with their crew Ms. Dini receiving guests with warm welcome and offering menu that suit your family"
Loved the surprise Bday cake,"At first, we were sadden because there was no bday surprise even though I added it in my reservation, but before we left, they actually had prepared a surprise - and we were actually surprised by it, cause we thought it was already forgotten.

[++] Food price is also not that high, and taste is very good

[++] The servers are friendly as well"
Birthday dinner + vegetarian friendly restaurant,"Nice and chill out dinner place. They have quite a varieties of vegetarian dishes. The only bad side is that the place is ants friendly too. Mayb the management could look into some pest control on this. I love the nice gesture of having a polariod session during this birthday meal. We truly enjoyed the food and the night. Thanks, Prive!!"
Great service for 30pax from Dini,I had a networking event for 30 people. Dini was such a great service to us checking on individual and me the organizer how she should serve us right. A lot from the group has also mentioned that she did a great job for the night. Thanks Dini!!
Review on Prive chijmes,"Food is good, and service is fast. The only letdown was that we chose indoor seating and aircon was leaking water and I’m sure this is already happening for awhile."
Saturday lunch,"We were served by Dini and she was excellent. She understood what we wanted, she was patient with us as we wanted to wait for our friends to turn up before we ordered and she was attentive to us.

Food was excellent too. Good vibe at this Al fresco cafe.."
Excellent service,"Dropping a review to give a shout out to Bibi, who was incredibly attentive, patient and helpful to my dining group. Food was decent and served quickly, which helped a lot as some of us had to rush back for meetings."
one of the best birthday dinners ever!,"very tasty food with a decent selection of vegan food! not forgetting the top notch service and gave us a free slice of cake, a birthday card and took a polaroid photo for us. will definitely be back again!"
Great location ; good food ; not the best cocktails or service,"We had a good meal, the ambiance was great since its on the Chijmes grounds. the cocktail was very watered down, service was slow - especially becuase we were literally sat on top of each other with our adjacent table - despite me asking if they could move the table a bit."
Always a good experience,"I love dining at Prive restaurants. My husband and I don't get a lot of couple time but so far the two times that I've brought him to a Prive restaurant, it's always a special occasion. This time is was to celebrate the anniversary of us being girlfriend and boyfriend 31 years ago. We had a wonderful lunch there. Thanks, Prive!"
Best Nasi Goreng,"Great food, lovely staff, and a really great vibe. The Satay Sticks were absolutely delicious and the Nasi Goreng I had for main was fantastic. Would definitely go again and recommend!"
No taste,No taste and disappointing. Have been here a few times but strange that it didn’t taste good this time round. Both meals were equally bland.
Ammiversary Dins,"Excellent food with very friendly service, the restaurant even gave us a complimentary cake and card as an anniversary gift (am touched!) Food is amazingly worth the price and delectable as well!"
Family dinner,"Early Sunday afternoon dinner turned out really nice. Perfect ambience with the lovely Chijmes setting. Dini our waitress was super amazing, providing us with valuable information on each dish we ordered to ensure we get the correct spice level for an enjoyable meal. Thank you also for the lovely slice of cake for my birthday (unfortunately i could not eat it as i am gluten and lactose intolerant), but the other did! Also the lovely birthday card and photo."
Friendly but shorthanded,Dini was amazing! She tried to keep up but mentioned only 1 indoor server for the evening. She tried her best to attend to us and I love the ambience dining at Prive.
Great evening,Service was very good. Was our anniversary and partner’s birthday and they surprise us with a cake and a birthday card. Food was very also good and fulfilling
Prive CHIJMES,Visited this outlet and am super pleased with the service!! Dhini who attended to us was super lovely and friendly!! Would totally patronise again!
Prive Chjimes evening,Very nice evening. Nice atmosphere. Good food and drinks and service pretty good - could be slightly more attentive but very friendly.
"Nice environment, awful food and service","Bad quality of the food, slow service and no explanations about how to order kids menu 120$ with no beverages - 2 adults + 2 children"
Happy evening with friend.,"Twas a very accessible place for me since it’s just across the hotel where I stayed, Carlton Hotel at Bras Basah. The waiter was very informative about the menu and gave us a very good service. Food was great and we were able to share with each other."
"Good Food, Good Ambience","Went for gathering with friends at CHJIMES outlet, happy with the food and the friendly service. Reserve table in advance if you are planning to come during peak period."
Best casual vegan dining,"Loved the outdoor ambiance, live music downstairs, menu full of vegan options... and that vegan sticky date pudding was to die for good - be back soon 😍"
Went for lunch and one of the staff was extremely rude,"Firstly i like prive and this experience was a first. we waited for 15 mins after being shown to our tables before someone took our order, mind you there were hardly any diners. A very grumpy server came to take order and was very uninterested and rude. Had buddha bowl and my friend had a salad, when we ordered extra servings of the salmon and meat, he reminded us rudely that it came at an extra cost and if we were sure we wanted it. We later ordered coffee. I ordered a piccolo and requested for it to be less milky and with more foam, to which the server responded with “i can try but cant promise”. Guess what i got it a little extra milky. I really dont remember prive to have lowered their standards so badly. I really used to love this place. Hope they can get back to their original standards of service."
Birthday Celebration,Awesome service by the Prive Team in Chijmes! Loved the ambience and attentive crew that service us for with fabulous dishes!! Highly recommended.
Family dinner,"Have been to Prive several times but a little worried this evening as nearly ordered something that contains nuts and I have a nut allergy. The menu states things that contain nuts or dairy etc by having a symbol next to the dish but unfortunately in the dessert section, the banoffee cheesecake didn’t say it contained nuts but when I asked the waitress, she checked in the kitchen only to be told that there were nuts in the biscuit base of the cheesecake. I have hadn’t have asked just for check, I potentially could have eaten something that could have sent me to hospital. The menu needs to be updated fully to advise customers exactly what’s on dishes."
Good food and friendly stff,"Food recommendations were really good, had the chicken satay and mini vegan sliders. Service was superb by a friendly waiter called Kevin, prompt service and went the extra mile to make sure we got what we wanted. Good sense of humour and brilliant service. Will come again."
All too well night,"Nice place to chill, food is nice. The staff name Joel is very nice and attentive. I notice that even on a busy period he still smile and make sure that all tables were serve accordingly."
Had a great night :-),"Beautiful evening out, food was lovely, particularly excellent service from Jo-el who offered us perfect recommendations for cocktails."
BAD SERVICE. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! BAD BAD BAD,"We dined here and the service was so bad! We spoke to the manager and he was so rude. Food was bad too. I DO NOT RECOMMEND. Please save yourself the hassle and time because it was a -10000/10.

KJ, the restaurant’s manager was so RUDE. Unbelievable. Bad service, bad ambiance, bad food, bad manager service. Absolutely disappointed."
Quick drink?!,"Shocking service, had to fetch drinks ourselves in the end after waiting 15 mins for 1 glass of wine and half a pint - at 5.15pm. Customer service non-existent, waiting staff didn’t care. Won’t be coming back."
Overpriced,Despite specifying no spices because the meal is for a Bobby the lobster linguine first came with chilli and then with pepper. Insufficient ventilation (broken can we were told)
Nice ambience but many mosquito,"a pleasant dining experience, I love their food. Just a little annoyed by the mosquito. Probably the restaurant need to look into it."
CHIJMES sit out,"A very nice place to dine out under the skies. Situated in the compound of CHIJMES the restaurant is a very nice place to sit out and have a meal. The whole area is lit up by decorative lights. The service is fast. The place seems to be very popular as we had to wait to get a table. The food is on the expensive side but given the ambiance of the place it is worth it. We had the famous chilli crab spaghetti of Singapore and club sandwiches. The portions are very good. The food is also delicious.
Worth visiting this place for good food"
Fast stand good service,"The dishes and drinks were served shortly after we ordered. It was fast and the staffs always carry a smile. Only improvement might be the wooden table which quite a lot (not high table) are infested with ant. Ants go onto the drink, food and even the water. Worth going but take a high table."
Ordinary food and pathetic service,It was extremely humid and the food options very limited. On top of this the service personnel are very unfriendly and lack common sense.
"Lovely Staff, Good Views",Celebrated birthday with family. Staff was helpful and gave a personalised birthday card. Ambience was great. Thank you!
Nice Atmosphere,"Beautiful place to sit and relax with a small meal. The atmosphere of the outdoor seating inside the walls of Chijmes is simply magical. Non alcoholic drinks are expensive though. $6 for a coke. It's more a bar with food, than a restaurant."
Online reservation missing,"I had ordered a table for 4 a day before through their website with Chope. However, the waiter was unable to find the reservation. The waiter suggested us to do alfresco dining under the hot sun"
Alfresco setting with beautiful ambient,"Overall the food was quite nice. Just that due to the alfresco style dining, it can get quite warm and there are insufficient fans around to keep the airflow. And do take note, there is a coverage fee if you wanna bring your own bday cake to celebrate. It was also quite difficult to get the attention of the staffs, from food ordering, to refilling of water and getting the bill."
Birthday celebration at Chijmes,"The ambience at night is really festive with all the fairy lights. The vibe is casual and chill. The servers are attentive and efficient, really appreciate their service. One of us is celebrating birthday and they gave the birthday boy a personlised birthday card with all the staffs’ signatures and help us took a polaroid for keepsake. We got a complimentary slice of birthday cake too. That was a nice touch. Apple and cinnamon blondie is delicious."
Disappointed,"Our son and daughter-in-law took us here with their 9month old baby on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch,3.30, as the baby was sleeping at lunchtime. The service was very slow. My son found a piece of plastic in his pulled pork burger and commented about it to possibly the manager (the only staff member in a suit), who made nothing of it, just saying, “I’ll inform the kitchen”. Not even an apology. We also ordered an extra coffee and we had to ask three times for it. We shan’t be going back."
Lovely place for a chilled Sunday brunch,"midst the beautiful environs of chimes, this is a lovely spot to have a relaxed breakfast or brunch. We went with the family and had a lovely time. Service can definitely be improved. Food quality made up for it though."
Such bad service,"We were super happy to come brunching on a saturday, but service was so bad .... they did not say hello, they made us wait in the sun standing for 10 minutes, because they were too busy to place us. We asked three times to order after 30 min on the table, and they all were so rude, I could not believe it. First time like this in Singapore to be honest..."
Dinner,Staff were not friendly and attitude. They don’t respond and just walk away else they talk in an unwilling manner. Food was serve fast though. If I ever visit this outlet again is because of how pretty chijmes is.
Pleasant surroundings,I managed to call and get a table the day before. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food was not exciting. Maybe we didn’t choose the best options. We enjoyed the nice outdoor-like surroundings but sheltered from light drizzle.
Lunch,"Stuff not friendly..they don’t even greet the guess.. Bad experience, poor service staff, especially the stuff greeting the guests, not flexible and rude. will no come again."
Very many Vegan options aVailable,"Its been some time since I visited Prive. The food is generally good and there is something for everyone. This time I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of vegan options available. They could make vegan substitutes and the staff were empowered and knowledgeable in telling you the options. We had a slight hiccup with one order and they gave us a complimentary dessert and were very apologetic. We didn't expect anything and this added to an already charming afternoon. The Muchos Nachos was delicious! The Impossible minced meat did not taste 'meaty' at all. The staff recommended a pasta dish for a friend who could not have garlic and onions as well and she said the dish was tasty. Kudos to the amiable and affable staff who were working at capacity but who managed to entertain all our queries. I am also wary of having to pay a lot for a meal in these days and times but the total bill was reasonable for four. I did not manage to get the staffs' names but I hope that they get some acknowledgement of their good work! We were there (CHIJMEs) on Friday, 18th March at lunchtime."
Bad experience,"Bad experience, poor service staff, especially the stuff greeting the guests, not flexible and rude. will no come again."
A great meeting place with the best coffee,"This resturant in situated in an oasis in downtown Singapore. It’s a great place to meet and a great place to eat. The star of the show is the coffee, I had a flat white and it was sublime. To eat I had the eggs Benedict. The ham was a mini gammon steak and over all it was a good tasty serving. But this place is all about the setting, coffee and service which was very good."
Good ambience,The atmosphere was pleasant and food overall was nice. Quality of paper straw could be improved as it turned completed mushy after being in the smoothie for a while.
Ho,"Rude staff and unpleasant service!

Ordered a 10"" pizza, a male staff told me that flavor can be mixed if I prefer a combo but he didn't inform me that this would cause a double charge on the bill. Upon settling bill, I asked why is the price doubled whilst I only ordered 1 pizza.

He answered back: ""You should know you'll be charged twice if you order a double flavour!"" Even after I feedback that this should be informed to me upon ordering to ensure a clear understanding, he wasn't apologetic nor try to explain in a proper manner, but rather rudely blaming me that this is a common sense and definitely customer would have expected to be charged!

Food & service not worth the price anyways. Will not return."
Soso,Food wasn’t of standard. The pizza crust was too thick and hard. The sliders burgers were also very hard. But the happy hour drinks was worth it
Can be better,"After visiting the restaurant, I was a little disappointed with the food and service. The ambience is nice and it is a great place for families and friends to dine in but other than that, there is no other reason for us to return. Food is very average and there are many other better choices in CHIJMES. Services....hmm, I think robots can do a better job. No greetings, no smile never mind. The services staff don't seem to be happy to work there. We went on a weekday afternoon when there were not many tables occupied. It might be worse on weekends."
"Nice ambiance, mediocre food","The area is really nice and has a nice view or the courtyard. It's great that is is alfresco dining and there are shaded tables. The food unfortunately did not meet my expectations and was very mediocre. I appreciate that there are many vegetarian and vegan options. However, the flavor was a bit lacking. Staff was friendly."
Wednesday's Date Night,"Overall, food was average. Had the chilli and lime salmon but salmon was slightly bland. Drinks were, however great.

Ambience were amazing. My boyfriend and I loved the environment at Chijmes.

Not to forget, thank you team! All staffs and manager were attentive and accommodating despite the crowd.

Would definitely come back for more drinks!"
Quaint Getaway,We had the Fish and Chips which tasted great. Ambience was quaint and relaxed. Definitely plan on returning
Mr Kapil,"Overall ambiance and service is superb.
Food is fairly average or below average. In my humble view it’s not value for money.
Overall taste is similar to average cafe food. We were disappointed with overall quality, taste and depth in food for a brand like such.

It’s not experience worth considering again.
Usually generous with my feedback, but food was truly below average."
Great vibes,"Sunday brunch - great coffee, pasta and vibes. Sat “indoors” which was just a sheltered open air area which was cooling. Wasn’t too crowded until the lunch crowd started at about 1pm."
Dining @ Chijmes,"The ambience was good, breezy on the day of visit.
Staff was not so attentive but some are ok, i reckon most are part-timers so don't expect much.

The bad thing is that we spotted so many crawling ants on our table, quite a disappointment. The management got to do something about it lest someone is eating those ants with the food as they might not see it in the night environment."
Very good,"This was the 1st visit to Prive Chijmes for my bf and I. We had an awesome experience. We ordered the pizza and steak with fries, berries crumble with ice cream. Everything was scrumptious! As I was celebrating bf's birthday, the staff surprised us with a cake and happy birthday on our dessert plate. They even gave him a birthday card that wished him a happy birthday with their handwritten wishes and signatures. That was an extremely nice gesture from them and a great way to end the meal. Will definitely be back after this wonderful experience. Thanks for the 100% service!"
A tad disappointed but would try again,"We visited Prive Chijmes as we had a lovely experience the previous time at the Orchard outlet.

I have to be honest the iced lemon tea was a tad bitter because the lemon has been saturated.Staff should take note of the content before serving to guest .Still we were kind to just accept it .

I ordered chicken rice because nothing could go wrong w rice .Turns out that pairing brown rice w the yellow kampung chicken was a bad choice,the chicken feels cold and slightly hard .

Thankfully ,the other dishes were tastier and I do like eating samosas though pairing it w curry sauce might have been more scrumptious.

When we asked the staff about the chicken,he pretended that he didn’t hear us .Clearly he is either half deaf or socially awkward

I hope Prive can do better and honestly chicken rice is not your expertise.If you ever update your menu,be sure to leave chicken rice OUT !

Thanks !"
100 for nice environment and friendly staff but not the best food though,"If you are looking for a great place to hang out for drinks, it is an excellent choice.... But the food is blend and not standing out for that price Overall all 7.5/10"
Review of Prive Chjimes,We enjoyed the dinner. Service was pleasant and staff was friendly. Nice ambience. Weather was fantastic. Will go next time again.
There for the ambience,"Food was really average, wanted to try the truffled pizza but it was sold out, & i thought we were pretty early to eat at 5pm. Got the pulled pork burger, crayfish pasta & crabcakes. And no kidding when i say the best dishes were the salad & fries from the burger. The food is not bad per se, just really nothing to be amazed about. The merlot wine was not fantastic too, beer was not smooth too. So I guess just be there for a cheap drink if you don't mind & bask in the al fresco ambience."
Decent but can be better,"I ordered steak and both came out raw + rare when they were supposed to be medium. But their pasta + fish & chips were good! Not sure if is the raw steak i ate, I had a pretty bad stomach flu at night."
Great atmosphere and friendly staff,"The food was really great and amazing especially the Tracey’s salad and truffled pizza! We enjoyed the outdoor atmosphere, chill and relax. The staffs were extremely friendly and we are blessed and surprise they even prepare a birthday card and photo for my friend. We will definitely come back again. Keep it up!"
Bad experience,"The food was average, satay dry, samosa like those frozen n deep fry. Salad was average, pizza freshly bake. The waitress drop the drink onto my son. A bad experience"
Friendly staff and excellent service!,"Food portion was big and most importantly, staff was friendly. We were celebrating an occasion and the manager took a Polaroid photo for us with a special card. Thanks for the great service!"
Perfect chill out place,"Good food, attentive staff and excellent ambience. Staff even prepared a card for our friend’s celebration! Will definitely visit again :)"
Birthday Celebration,Thanks KJ and his team (chefs and staffs) for the birthday surprise! It was a truly great experience! Definitely will recommend friends and family to this place!
Lunch at PRIVE@CHIJMES,Fabulous ambience with delicious food for my birthday celebration catch-up with my aunt. I have been thinking of the All Day Breakfast and my craving is satisfied.
A cozy outdoor Privé experience!,"We were served by a nice young chap Joel, whom was initially shy & reserved, but upon our warm & friendly engagement with him, he reciprocated with more confidence & friendliness, offered us his sincere recommendations on food & served us well, me & my friend Mavis truly enjoyed our dinner and we were one of last few who left the place! Keep up the good work Joel and thank you!"
Keep up the good service Joel!,"Thanks for your service dedication & friendly deposition, we enjoyed our time at Prive CHIJMES tonight! Keep up your good work! Cheers"
Disappointing,"Food was very average, service was slow. The steak we ordered was raw but tough as rubber. Wine was average. Prive was much better years ago"
Birthday Celebration,"I went with my friend for a post-birthday celebration. We ordered sliders, carbonara, grilled chicken and some desserts. The food was average but the ambience and whole experience was incredible. After our mains we ordered tiramisu for dessert and it came with complimentary cake from the restaurant. They even took a polaroid of us and handed it along with a greeting card from the team. I will definitely recommend celebrating birthdays or special occasions here!"
Terrible experience,Strict time limit. Staff didn't mention about time limit when asking for additional glasses of beers and we were asked to leave soon after ordering new drinks...
Nice ambience food was okay,Had the crayfish pasta was okay . berry smoothie was very diluted 😔😔 portion of steak fries was good
Great ambience and service,"Everything was great! The food, the ambience, and the service. The staff were really polite and warm. I went on my birthday and they even went the extra mile to help us take a Polaroid picture and gave me a card! The lights around CHIJMES are beautiful so that really adds to the chill vibes and romantic mood too. We had tiramisu, nachos, impossible ribs and the salmon - the salmon was an amazing combo of flavours do try it!! 10/10 would recommend :)"
Nice atmosphere -- good for a cool night,"The food is unremarkable, sort of like a pizza express or slightly better than a chain restaurant. it is passable but you won't come for the food, you come for the atmosphere, eating in the courtyard surrounded by trees and the moonlight. Perfect for a cooler night . Shame about the star wars type music, but overall a nice night."
A pleasant evening dining to never forget,"We had an amazing experience. The service was impecable, the food delicious, and the ambience fantastic. KJ was diligent and has an joyful attitude which helped the busy evening service a breeze for everyone"
Great to be dining out again,Made a last minute reservation as we were going to a candlelight concert after dinner. So nice to have quick efficient service and even better to have a great atmosphere with great music again. Food was great and we love the Chijmes location for Prive.
Thanks for the effort,Celebrated birthday here. The staff gave us cake and took polaroid for us along with a birthday card. Everyone of the staff wrote onto the card. My date was very touched. Thank you guys!
A birthday made special!,"We visited Privé Chijmes to celebrate my husbands birthday. I made a reservation online and indicated a note that it was a birthday celebration dinner. And it was the best decision I’ve made. Not only that the food was great, but the service was spectacular! They were friendly and have always made sure our experience was awesome. They even serve a sloce of cake for the celebrant and took a our family photo and amazingly, to our surprise, they hand us over a birthday card with our printed photo and oh boy, the staff write short messages on the card for their greetings. If its not the best service, I dont know what is. Thank you very much Prive and to the rest of the staff at Chijmes."
