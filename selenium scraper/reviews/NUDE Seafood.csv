Mix Of Eastern And Western,"My sister recommended this place and my siblings celebrated my brothers girlfriend b/day.
Overall it was good, but, service was a bit lacking due to a full house.
We had Scallops and baby squid to share and it was very nice especially the squid, everybody also like the Shakshouka.
We wanted the Momo but it was not available. So we had the Tiger Prawns and Clams.
For the mails, the five of us ordered two we had ordered Chirashi Don, Miso Halibut & Udon, Bouillabaisse Seafood Stew, NZ Wagyu Staek, Also the Short ribs were not available. The Chirashi comes in a small bowl but it packed to the brim with goodies and is very very filling, The Udon was ok and the steak was done to my brothers expectations."
Loving it,I have tried the food on numerous occasions on takeaway. Loving it and very flavourful Thank you Nude team specially the boys behind the kitchen. Two thumbs up
Very fresh seafood,"The food was wonderful. We had the tuna, swordfish and mochi for dessert. All three were very fresh and delicious. We would highly recommend dining here and will be back on our next visit."
Never disappoint,"Overall the food quality of this restaurant is consistently good. This time round we went food tasting for a wedding set. The first dish was best presented and the last dish/the sweet let you leave the restaurant with a smile. The restaurant looked a little messy, if only they can improve the appearance a little more."
Fresh and good quality,Read so much about the place and decided to do a takeaway as I was around the vicinity. Must say that the ribs and pasta still tasted good even though this was a takeaway order. The grilled pineapple with the ribs was a nice refreshing change.
Good,"Tried the feast for 2 and got blown away with the taste and quality of seafood. We ordered the baby squid, Hokkaido scallop, seafood ariabiatta and fisherman’s stew and all tasted amazing. Price is reasonable for the quality."
Ambience was pleasant but food wasn't that great!,"My family and I like to try new cuisines and visit different types of restaurants, so we tend to eat out quite a fair bit. One of my family member came across NUDE Seafood with wonderful reviews and we were looking forward to our Sunday meal. We ordered for the Feast of Four, the scallops and king oysters mushrooms were pleasant, the rest of the dishes like the Iberico Ribs, Momo (Yakitoti), Rosti and noodles were slightly salty and actually not quite prepared to the standards how we had expected, we gave our feedback to the lovely waitress. Then there was a gentleman who came over to attend to us, I think he could be the line manager. We feedback to him about the dishes, he asked us if we wanted an offset to our bills with his expression which looked somewhat unwelcoming with his tone! Surely I was taken aback and felt that the whole experience later on wasn't very comfortable, our intention was to give a honest and genuine feedback but didn't see this coming. Then, when it came to dessert selection, we asked him to give us a recommendation and he replied by saying dessert was on the house and he also gave us a complimentary cold drinks to all of us, it was a lovely gesture. However, I felt the atmosphere became rather uncomfortable and a little awkward. We were all looking forward to an enjoyable Sunday meal."
Pleasant dining experience,"We ate lunch at Nude Seafood at Marina One. It is the same site as Nude Grill. The outdoor seating was pleasant as it was windy and overlooked a landscaped indoor garden. The menu has been reduced and some items have been removed.
There are set menus but we ordered ala carte. Food tasted very delicious. Service was good and both hot and cold water was provided free.
After lunch, we took a stroll at the indoor garden."
Great seafoood!,"Great seafoood! Walking 5-10 minutes from Marina Bay Sands, this restaurant offer very good food in a much more reasonable prices. Service was pretty efficient and ambiance was also good"
Delicious seafood,"During the circuit breaker, we ordered twice from this restaurant by delivery. The seafood is excellent and both meals were enjoyable."
Located on Marina One East,"Located on Marina One East Tower, it was easy to locate. Upon exiting from the elevator, it was just ahead.

The food was yummy. Fine dining at affordable prices. We had the Bara Chirashi, Grandpa’s Fish Soup, Bouillabasse Seafood Stew and Fish & Chips. Was a great and satisfying meal in a nice ambience.

Enjoyed the kuro goma cake as well as the matcha cake.

Best of all, it’s pet-friendly. Will be back."
Amazing seafood at very reasonable price!,Came here to celebrate my fiance's birthday! We had such a great time. Location was excellent and food was so tasty! Also they gave us a slice of cake for free. Great service!
"Delicious food, excellent service.",Celebrated lunar new year with friends over dinner with Lohei and the food was fantastic and service was warm. Would definitely go back again.
Seafood Gastronomic Expedition,"Nude Seafood is a casual dining restaurant serving exceptional seafood ingredients with generosity and hospitality. Located in Marina Bay Financial Centre, NUDE Seafood (‘NS’) only open on weekdays.

We visited NUDE Seafood as part of our foodies’ monthly gathering. Due to our group size, NS asked us to pre-order the food in advanced, to ensure we did not miss out anything from the menu and we have sufficient cooking time. What a thoughtful gesture.

We started with smaller dishes.

Tofu Skin Salad ($5.80). The beancurd skin use is similar to those commonly used in China. It has a slight rubbery texture, filled with the traditional smoky aroma of boiled soymilk. Together with the spinach and cloud ear fungus plus sour plum vinaigrette, it becomes an appetizing and refreshing starter.

Crab & Egg White Chawanmushi ($8). This is a luxurious version of chawanmushi and it worth every penny. Using only the egg white, the texture of the steam egg is smooth, silky and infused with the sweetness of the crab meat.

Broccoli ($5.80). Simple stir-fried broccoli. It is crunchy and topped with almond for additional crunchiness.

Black Pepper King Prawn ($6.90), min order is 2 pcs and served with fried mantou. The prawns are crispy and aromatic. The sauce is thick, with strong assam flavour and black pepper. The crispy yet fluffy fried mantou nicely complement this dish and we use it to polish up the sauce.

Gochujang Cauliflower ($6.80). Combining the crispy texture Cauliflower coated with signature Korean red pepper paste. The pickled daikon helps to balance the overwhelming flavour; however, I find the crispy almond is unnecessary.

Moving to the bigger portion dishes.

Hickory-Smoked Salmon ($12.80) in Bamboo Leaf. The salmon has a moist with a nice smoky aroma to it. It is nice to eat on its own or with a bowl of rice.

‘Squirrel’ Grouper ($18.80). Crispy deep-fried grouper fillet, highly stacked with sweet and sour sauce as the base. The oatmilk espuma on top gave it a wow factor. I like the juicy lychee, bursting with sweetness that enhances the sauce in this dish.

Steamed Pomfret ($13.80). One side of pomfret fillet, steam on a lotus leaf and topped with ‘Mei Cai’ vegetables. You can taste the natural flavours and the firm texture of the pomfret, topped with crunchy and salty mei cai with a mild spicy flavour in it.

Oatmilk Spinach Tofu ($12.80). Smooth and velvety spinach tofu topped with crispy kale. The sliced mushrooms and tofu are basked in the gravy. It tasted like Chinese olive leaves.

Miso-Grilled Halibut ($20.80). A very simple presentation of the dish. The charred miso flavour works well with the fatty halibut fillet. It is served with robust mushroom broth to bind the shiitake and spinach together. I can finish a bowl of rice with just this dish.

For carbo, we ordered Salted Fish Blue Pea Flower Rice, Jinhua Ham ($4.80) & Blue Pea Mushroom Rice ($4.80). Using Nigata sushi rice, the rice is texture on these both carbo dishes are plump and juicy. The taste of Jinhua ham is very subtle and overpowered by the sweetness of the corn.

Meanwhile, the mushroom rice is outstanding. It is tasty and the umami flavour from the mushroom really shines. The content of the chopped mushrooms in the rice are very generous and the dish can be eaten on its own without the need to be complemented by other dishes.

For desserts, housemade Tiramisu is a must-try here. Each layer in the tiramisu is very solid, filled with thick cream, solid coffee flavour and rum. This might not be a permanent item on the menu, so keep a lookout for it.

The restaurant setting is casual and modern, with Jazz music playing in the background serenading the diners. The open kitchen concept is an attraction on its own. Service is attentive and friendly. A good place to dine for casual or even business dining.

Overall, it was like a gastronomic journey of in the sea world. There are many different types of fishes to try cooked in different ways. The seafood is fresh and it is enjoyable to the palate. A must try restaurant around Marina Bay Financial Centre. Cheers!!"
Great mod fusion seafood,"Slightly japanese influenced cooking style but have lots of other Asian styles cooking methods. Seafood, fish especially is fresh and portions are just right for us. Reasonably priced for a makan joint lovated right in the heart of mbfc. Will visit again!"
Always a pleasure to dine here,"We came in a little earlier than the last round and had Halibut and Salmon plus some of their specialty dishes. The food was excellent, the service was fantastic. We were always surprised by the quality they dish out!"
New menu change,"I visited with my friends on Mon and realised to my dismay that the dinner menu has been changed and some of my favourite dishes such as the pastas and grilled octopus have been removed. While the food was different and tasted good enough, I remain slightly disappointed that the previous standards have dipped as compared to the past few times that I’ve been. I would recommend going there for lunch as I saw that the usual mains are still available then."
"Many good ideas, a touch away from refining","Overall we really enjoyed the place. However they just released the dinner menu and although everything we ordered tasted really good, they all came individually and without sides. We were expecting more of an individual portion sized meals rather than main dishes with rice concept."
Christmas Dinner,Food as always was excellent. Would have liked though individual platings instead of sharing between 2 people.
Dinner at Nude,"nice experience at Nude, seafood was excellently fresh. but choices of menu is kind of concentrated to mainly salmon,, would be nice for choices on vegetables"
Great experience at NUDE Seafood,"Snapper and salmon were fresh and well-prepared. Good and relaxed atmosphere on a weeknight. Overall, a good dining experience."
Lunch at NUDE,Great place. Good people. Fast service. One of the very few places in CBD Singapore where food is served fast and good as well. Two vegetarian options also available.
Good simple food at a good price,"Went on a Friday evening and the place wasn’t packed which was great. Food was great, atmosphere will great! Nice place to come chit chat with a small group of friends"
"Quality food, great taste!","We ordered the crispy octopus tentacles as starter. Smoked salmon, miso snapper and a mushroom main course. They were all so delicious! Would definitely be back!"
Awesome food!,"Wanted to bring my wife for her birthday celebration and was recommended NUDE Seafood. I was not disappointed. The mains were made to perfection. I ordered the Duo of Miso Snapper and Grilled Salmon while my wife had the Slipper Lobster Linguine. The snapper and the salmon were grilled to perfection, and the salmon was so fat that it just melts in your mouth. and both fish were grilled with such skill that the char taste is not overpowering that it covers the fresh fish flavour. The slipper lobster linguine was also tasty, and the herbs coupled with the chilli and spices just blended perfectly to bring out the taste of the slipper lobster, while the umami seeped into the linguine and filled it with a subtle seafood taste with every bite.

We got the Matcha strawberry tiramisu and the Passion fruit with yuzu tofu desserts. the Matcha Straberry Tiramisu is a must try! The matcha removes sthe cheesy creamy taste of the mascarpone cheese so every bite is very refreshing, coupled with fresh strawberry slices.

However i felt that the Passion Fruit with Yuzu Tofu was a hit-and-miss. In my opinion the soft tofu texture didnt gel quite well with the citrusy yuzu jelly, and the strong acidic passion fruit is too strong and overbearing that it covers the soft citrusy taste of Yuzu.

Overall it was a good experience!!

9/10 will recommend NUDE to my friends!"
Disappointing,"I had pleasant dining experiences twice previously, and decided to host 2 guests for dinner. Big mistake.

Where to begin? Two of us ordered the hickory smoked salmon (one had the saba as well). The slabs of fish were smaller than on previous occasions, and while the fish was piping hot, the rice was cold. A big thumbs down.

The guests wanted chawan mushi - but that order was somehow never conveyed to the kitchen. The chawan mushi never came, and although we asked, no one could enlighten us. One guest ordered the slipper lobster, but that looked more like crayfish. Shambles.

To top it off, Shah, the duty supervisor, had a distinctly unpleasant and unwelcoming vibe when taking our orders. But all that changed when he served a group of Caucasians. What a disgrace.

Pity that they turned a loyal customer into a turned off one."
First lunch @ NUDE,"Awesome food, excellent people. More importantly you get a table to sit any amy point in time during the lunch hour at this lunch crowd crazy area. Precisely 2 vegetarian options, some nice hot and cole drinks. Worth trying. Vegetarian sans mushroom is difficult!"
"Great mains, not so great starter",The hickory smoked salmon with sticky black rice was done just right (we could really breathe the hickory smoke). The squid starter however was rather chewy.
Bad paella,"Just had dinner there with friends and ordered the paella. Should have imagined there was something wrong when the waiter said it’d take 10 minutes to be ready. I’d say it was the worst paella I’ve ever had, but that’s not a paella. It’s more like left over steamed rice with tomato sauce and some seafood on top - mushy and tasteless rice, wet lumps, rubber tough clams... at least the prawns were fine.

I like Nude and eat there often but was very disappointed this time. This review should be a wake up call."
Birthday Celebration at a Wonderful Restaurant,"Celebrated by brother’s birthday & we’ve decided to bring him to this restaurant that I’ve tried out before, and knew would not disappoint. As to maintain the freshness of the ingredients & they do not keep large portions in hand, it would give great to make a reservation & pre order. We got ourselves 3 dinner sets which offers a starter, main, pre dessert & dessert. Among the starter, Baby Squid left a huge impression in our mouth & heart as it was succulent and packed full of flavour. As for the main, I liked the Ocean Trout best as it was prepared nicely, not over done, and it was juicy, the Yuzu emulsion complimented the dish perfectly. For dessert, we voted Chocolate, Blueberry & Thyme as our favourite; the Thyme ice cream is really special as we’ve yet to try it as an ice cream. It’s a really lovely desert to end the night with! I really liked how they take the guests opinions and feedbacks seriously, it’s nice to know that our thoughts would make a difference on how they’re going to present their dishes in the future."
Tasty seafood eats in Marina Bay,"Tried to reserve a table for lunch but Chope said no availability - I suppose reservations for lunch are not allowed. Place was packed to the gills and you eat cheek by jowl with other diners.

However the food was good. I had the hickory smoked salmon with black sticky rice - very good. Didn't intend to finish the rice but I did. Companions's kaisen don (salmon on rice) was also very good - but they had mistakenly packed it in a plastic bowl thinking he wanted it to go (he didn't). This was strange since I, the other diner in the same party, was not having it to go.

Snafu aside, would return. At an off peak hour."
Excellent Experience,The great food is prepared with lots of effort and the ambience is good for chilling out. The staff are very warm and informative for the dishes served up! It's awesome to know what I'm eating :D
Dinner in Nude Seafood,"We have a great time as the food are very good, the staffs are friendly. the location is convenient as well. they don't open for weekend."
"Unpretentious, creative dishes","I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to NUDE seafood. Each of their dishes have a creative twist to them and are really value for money! I particularly enjoyed their octopus, ocean trout, and dark chocolate dishes. Job well done! Staff were prompt and cheerful. Pleasant experience and will highly recommend this place."
Stripped them NUtritious & DElicious seafood bare,"NUtritious & DElicious affordable fine-dining seafood dinner. Started with the Baby Squid / Manila Clams. Main entree were the Golden Pomfret / Ocean Trout. Then enter the Pre-Dessert - Chef's Creation. Pre-Dessert was not enough and too little!! We also had the Main (Vegetarian) Dessert - Polar Bear / Mango, Coconut, & Thai Basil / Chocolate, Blueberry, & Thyme.

A 4-course meal which deserves a very empty stomach by skipping lunch. Meals were served fast and orderly. Waitress even briefed us on what we were eating."
expensive,main were very disappointing esp for the price we paid. only saving grace was the scallop and squid starter. will not revisit.
ok experience,"we had the $49++ dinner set. the food was ok, the portion were pretty small though. overall, nothing to write home about."
"Amazing food, nice environment and handles crowds well","Food quality was super amazing, surprised for something that is 'fast food'. Super crowded though at lunches, but they try and sort it by giving you table numbers and sort seating. Definitely a great place for lunch if you're around the area"
Excellent blend of flavours with very fresh ingredients,"We ordered the dinner set and each dish was absolutely delicious - with the freshest of ingredients and mix of flavours that complement!

One thing to note though, my friends and I thought the Bowl of green tea ramen was actually not needed. Perhaps the restaurant could consider that to be optional instead."
Great value,"Excellent value and food. We took a set (4 course) and enjoyed it very much. The food was very innovative with a different intrepretation of a normal dish.

We had swordfish cervice, it was served along with cucumber sorbet. Very unique. We also had the hokkaido scalop and enjoyed it very much.

Will recommend this place to everyone i know"
First impression,It was my first time to Nude after reading a review online and I'm glad that I've made the choice. The staff was friendly and alert. Food was amazing. The dishes we had were fresh and tasty. I look forward to new selections on the menu.
Great coffee,"Selected menu but everything is cooked to perfection. Nude magic - the cold espresso with cream is a really nicely made coffee, latte is great too."
My dinner @ Nude,Excellent food quality in terms of both taste and presentation. Good value for money too. And service is exemplary
Totally exceeded expectations,"Went on a business dinner here during August. I had no expectations before going but was blown away by the experience. I have eaten at some excellent restaurants across Europe and this place would be right up there with the best. Choice, flavour, service, presentation and taste all fantastic. I had the prawns start and red snapper main, both of which were superb. I was with a party of 12 so we pretty much explored the whole menu between us and EVERYBODY was delighted. I even had a mango dessert ( not being a dessert person) and it was superb too. Just go , its excellent."
Possibly the best seafood restaurant in Singapore,"This place is the best if you're looking for seafood. The quality of the food has against all odds managed to improve upon what I thought was already perfection since the last I was here.

I had the Singapore mullet with tonnarelli and it was divine. The meat was tender, the skin crispy. My friends had the ocean trout and the flower grouper, both of which I tasted. The trout was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and the broth of the grouper was light and refreshing. The service was also excellent and I loved the fact that the waiters explained the dishes to us upon serving them.

I'm a seafood lover and I've been to plenty of supposedly good seafood places, like no signboard, mellben seafood, michelin starred/celebrity chef restaurants etc. But this place tops them all in terms of quality and value. My only complaint is that why in the world do they not open on weekends and public holidays????? These are the only times I'm more free to enjoy a good meal TT"
Best in bay area,I wish to invite my business guest to the restaurant. I am confident that it is one of best seafood in bay area!
Wonderful Dinner and evening,"Ordered 3 dinner sets for sharing. Portions were generous so best to share! Seafood were fresh, excellently prepared, with a modern twist.

Would have preferred mere options for dessert for the set, maybe 3 choices instead of current 2? Service was fast, attentive, place has a casual vibe and being centrally located at MBFC (Downtown MRT station), it's just a short stroll to Promontory and Marine Bay Sands, and onward to Gardens by the Bay for night views. Wonderful dinner and evening walk.

Will be back!"
"Good food, Good Service",This is my second time to Nude. Service is good. Food is great. Hope they will have more different varieties next time round. Otherwise it will be sometime later before I re visit this place again. A good place to catch dinner even for tourist. Skip the usual dinning places near Marina Bay Sands. Place is not open on weekends.
Crappy service,"Coffee is great but it's the lack of service which would stop us going back. The service is only reserved for a small handful of people. I have never come across such ego and arrogance from staff who I thanked but they never even bothered to look at me or acknowledge me, much less say anything other than to call out the coffee I bought..."
Comments on Nude Seafood,"Food good, ordered ocean trout, Think it's good.
Ambience okay, a little warm for me, and there is smell of food around, seems to be a nice place for couples
Service okay, not bad but not fantastic"
Great Asian seafood,Neat and tight menu with spot on flavour combination. Warm and satisfying plus works great for group
"Impeccable food, excellent service and passionate about their restaurant","I decided to give place a shot after reading a couple of reviews online. It seemed to be a nice cozy place to have a meal and boy was I blown away by the food and the service.

The food was impeccably prepared and delicious, the plating reminiscent of costlier establishments and the service was excellent, the explanation for each dish.

Definitely a place deserving of a returning visit!"
Fresh,An all seafood restaurant. Fish is very fresh as it is delivered from the fish wholesaler daily. Innovative menu and well priced
Very good dinner,"Will definitely go back. A solid 5 star. The food is superb and staff very friendly. If you are looking for a relaxed and casual dining, highly recommend this place."
Dinner,The service staff was very attentive and took the effort to explain every dish that they served and how to eat it. Very immaculate service for every visit that I went. The food just gets better and better.
great quality!,"Amazing for office lunch and they also have vegetarian option. I generally don't like cooked fish but their salmon and cod are amazing, and i often order their barachirashi :)
always wanted to go for their dinner as it also looks super delicious!"
Quality food,I had the barramundi and swordfish belly and both were fresh and delicious. Love the fish - chipped walls too.
Delicious. Great for business lunch,Great spot for lunch. Japanese influence. Small portions but delicious. Quick. Perfect for business lunch.
Impressive,"We visited after hearing about nude seafood from a friend, and it well exceeded our expectations.

The setting was modern and clean, comfortable and relaxed.

The seafood was delicious, the wine list and pairings were simple but hit the mark, the service was attentive and quick, and the price was surprisingly low for the location and quality of our experience.

We ordered the set menu ($45pp for the courses) and were delighted with every dish.

The staff were friendly while remaining respectful.

The only negative was that we found the restaurant a little tricky to locate, tucked away at the bottom of the commercial building above."
Birthday meal,Simple elegant food that's fresh and tasty. Friendly staff. A pity that that they don't serve coffee after 5pm. It would gone well with the desserts.
Great food,"Food was great! Although the interior of the place seems abit old fashioned but hey, when the food came it was a total surprise!"
Good quality and tasty but not substantial enough,I had Uni and Prawn pasta for lunch. It was full of flavour and very tasty but disappointingly small portion. Japanese Influence and very casual atomosphere.
Consistently execeeds expectations,6 of us Tried all the main course selections. Focus on delivering a selected set of mains means each dish is truly unique and well thought through.
My favorite restaurant in Singapore,"I've been lucky to get the opportunity to eat at Nude at least once a week for the past 6 months (when I was working right next door). Nude is the ONLY restaurant in Singapore that I will truly miss, now that I've leaving town for good. Their food is delicious and fresh. They have an outstanding customer service and all their staff are extremely attentive, accommodating and friendly. Of course, their Fantastic atmosphere can't be forgotten. If you're ever around, make sure you get in their and enjoy a meal or two. They have different menus for lunch and dinner. Both are truly exceptional and at affordable prices."
Awesome food,Been there twice and was never disappointed. The quality of the food is great with great service by the staff. Enjoyed the meal and would definitely visit it again.
3 Times Back at 5 Stars Service,"Nude is located on the ground floor street level next to MOS Burger.

I was recommended to try this eatery nearby the office and took an early dinner trip to a relatively light crowd on a weekday with my wife... I'd been during lunch and the system they employed of no table reservations a more evolved one in the city where the lunch crowd is heavy...

~during lunch you queue first and someone will ask if you wanna eat in, before you order they show you where a table is reserved with a ""Letter"" on a card & tell you to remember the ""Letter"". You order at one of the 2 counters and get a pager, then a table with the exact number of seats you need is found for you to sit and when your pager is buzzed you go collect your food at the counter. No worries many ordering are taking out or collecting to go

~lunch ordering is fast and fun... guys really fun crew behind the counter will put you at ease yet move the queue quickly along

~during dinner in a more relaxed environment they will provide table wait service and the tableside chat is enjoyable and attentive

Lunch
Bara Chirashi Bowl is SUPER YUMz x3 mix this up for a spoonful of bursting tastiness
Hickory-Smoked Salmon the grains here is flavorful and I polished them off easily YUMz

Dinner
Hokkaido Scallop Carpaccio oh this is YUMz
Pan-Roasted Whole Barramundi Fillet isn't very whole but a mite baby small for non Asian tastes
Chilean Seabass Roulade served with the tomato broth separately does indeed look like a fish finger
Iberico de Bellota Pork, Presa de Paleta has a potato foam that isn't foamy but is absolutely delicious YUMz

gotta point out that the crew here really have fun working and they rub off on the diners
I was here 3 times 2016Jun

NOTE there are no onsite restrooms at the restaurant and you gotta head out to the building locate the Workspace expresso bar diagonally across the foyer, walk into a stairwell and climb up to the mezzanine where they are located"
Distinctly Different,"We had the set dinner for $48 per person and ordered 2 different white wine. The crispy squid was really nice. We also ordered mussels but unfortunately we had a couple of mussels gone bad and it affected the entire bowl, so we had to change it to a duck dish which was good. We had the Miso swordfish belly which was very tasty, but only one piece was a belly and the 2nd piece of fish was not as soft. The sauce of the prawn pasta was distinctly different and unique in taste and I enjoyed that very much. Overall, the entire experience was good."
Excellent food,"First time visit with friends for dinner. The food was perfect, especially the smoke salmon! After the meal, we were served with two bowls of imported fruits! We were so surprised, and we guess it must be because I am the birthday girl~ :))
Although just in few quantity, but the fruits were so sweet and juicy!"
The food portion was really generous. Service was excellent and the atmosphere was great. Overall I would come back for.,The food portion was really generous. Service was excellent and the atmosphere was great. Overall I would come back for.
"Fast, healthy yet tasty take on one-dish seafood in Marina Bay area","Have been here a couple of times, with colleagues.

I can see why this place gets packed during lunch time, since their delicious one-dish meal enables fast turn around time.

The first time , my colleague recommended their Snapper ($23) which was grilled to perfection and accompanied by quinoa with cured duck and vegetables. The second time, I tried their hickory smoked salmon at a decent price of $17. They serve their salmon grilled with purple cabbage, with a side of interesting grains which they term '""forbidden"". This was drizzled with ponzu-olive oil.

Both times, I was pleasantly surprised how such healthy but quickly prepared 'fast' seafood can actually be delectable.

My colleague tried their Inaniwa Udon and unagi ($19) which is grilled eel with udon, cordycep mushroom, as well as mixed vegetable tempura, and enjoyed it too.

Another colleague tried their Uni and Prawn pasta ($24) which is prawn paired with squid ink tonnarelli pasta and potato strings, drizzled with sea urchin sauce, and proclaimed it tasty.

Dishes were simply, but still pleasingly presented.

This was a lunch for which there were no guilty feelings thereafter, since it was light yet adequate.

Highly recommended if one is craving for wholesome, yet tasty seafood without feeling any post-lunch slumber, especially for those who work around this area.

Come early or late, to avoid the long lunch time queues.

Helen
Singapore"
Excellent service!,Had to change my reservation a few times but the team kindly accommodated and even advised me to place advance orders as some items on the menu tend to run out. Staff was extremely attentive as well. Great place for a dinner after work!
Quick lunch catchup,"Recommended by my cousin to come here.

Packed for lunch and they dont do reservations for lunch. Logical given the lunch crush on Mon to Friday.

Superclean, not fussy.
Chill envrionment.

More importantly food was clean and not fussy and superbly tasty leveraging on fresh ingredients and good cooking from.the kitchen

Doesnt cost an arm and a leg

Will return for a dinner when less crowded."
"Delicious food, fantastic service","My 2nd time back at this place and it's well worth it. This time for its Winter Feast. Portion is quite overwhelming for the mains. Other than that, everything is wonderful. Will be back again soon!"
Lunch,"Service is great!
The lady at the register noticed I was pregnant, and made sure my needs were met. She asked to if I wanted my fish well done. She asked if I wanted to remove the egg from salad. I didn't have to ask for anything! Unexpected great service!

Food is good.
The salmon/grain dish I ordered was good, but the portion was fairly small, and dish was one dimensional. Literally just cabbage in the salad/slaw. Felt $17 for just rice/cabbage/small filet of fish was overpriced.

Ambience is loud.
My husband and I could barely hear each other sitting across a small table from each other. We were talking in each others faces most of the time, and we basically left the conversation until we got out of the restaurant."
"Very fresh, hearty portions","Chefs seem to be very proud of their dishes (and very validly so!). Good service, good food. Interesting fusion flavours. Good value for money."
Fresh Food and Wonderful Services,"Had a wonderful dinner experience in my recent visit with 2 other girlfriends for a special occasion. The waiters were very courteous and helpful. Our waiter explained each course served and were attentive without being intrusive. Food we ordered were fresh and delicious. Will recommend it to others. The only drawback is the open kitchen concept, which means the cooking smell may stay on you after dinning."
Great place for affordable quality food on a week night,"Affordable good quality dining options are rare in the CBD. I had dinner here with a girlfriend and we really enjoyed the great food and the unhurried dining atmosphere - at dinner the restaurant doesn't have the hustle and bustle / din that you encounter at lunchtime.

I had the King Prawn pasta with chorizo which was very tasty and something I would order again. I love that they give you a wine pairing option for each dish which makes dining feel a little more special. Kudos to this gem in Marina Bay Financial Center."
"Good Ambience, Excellent Service and Mouthwatering Menu Options!","I like how NUDE Seafood always review their menu options often! It makes me want to go back to keep trying out new dishes, and their dishes are always of superb quality! 👍🏻 Keep up the good work!"
"Great Food, Reasonable Price","Simple restaurant with great delicious food for lunch and dinner. Not too pricy. Good service. For lunch, do go early as it tends to get crowded after 12:30. Highly recommend the Hickory Smoked Salmon for lunch, Barramundi for lunch and dinner. Do try some of the desserts as well."
Nude experience,The visit was pleasant and the services were good. The staffs are professional and knowledgeable. Will visit them again (:
Amazingly fresh and innovative food,"I've been to Nude a total of 4 times now and the food has been outstanding every time. Even though it's mostly known as a super popular lunch spot, I think their dinner service should be commended as well. Fancy enough for a special event yet casual enough for a regular weeknight dinner, Nude's simple but well thought out menu had something for everyone in our party.

I had the cod which was paired with the most amazing tomato broth, and tried the Iberico pork and barramundi off my friends' plates. Everything was tender and perfectly cooked. The fritto misto is my favorite starter (although they're all very good) and the Irish oysters were super sweet. The panna cotta is a great way to end the meal. Nude also offers an affordable range of wines to choose from ($12-$16 per glass).

All the friends I've taken there love the food, and I would definitely go back to Nude again."
unhappy start but sweet ending... and Delicious food ...will certainly return,"Wasn't a very happy start intitally, when the service staff:
1) took our orders then came back to say that there's only one portion of pasta left ( it was like 745pm)
2) there wasn't any flexibility to adjust the menu abit to suit to their lack of ingredients ( eg prawns was sold out etc), so we thought perhaps we can have a salmon version etc
3) We wanted to order half a doz of oysters, but they said they are only left with 5 oysters (at 745 / 8pm) and we asked how will they charge, they wanted to charge us One single oyster with 2 pair of oyster charge which was pricier than the half doz.

End up after we made some noise on the pasta choices and the oysters and they tried to adjust and accomodate to us for the lack of ingredients and offered us an appetitser to make up for it.

They remmebered my request to have a dessert for a friend who was celebrating her birthday and it was a very yummy choc dessert. Everyone of us sang praises of it.

Overall happy after they tried to salvage the situation and the food is indeed nice. :)"
Delightful food and a wonderful team,"Booked out the restaurant for a private event recently and the good chefs here came up with an off-the-menu three course meal that really impressed us! I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the socialising in between courses (and may or may not have had a second helping of desert). While speaking to the co-founders, I learnt that the menu was conceptualised based on the transitioning of the season from summer to autumn. Always interesting to know what inspires new dishes!

Food aside, the dinner service team was top-notch - they helped with preparing the champagne toast, were attentive to the guests (small but noticeable things like topping up water, replacing utensils quickly etc), kept a look out for those with dietary restrictions despite them constantly switching seats, and did everything with a smile. These guys are pros.

Definitely looking forward to my next meal there (:"
"Aesthetic, good ambience, good food","The interior is very nice, modern Scandinavian/American design. Food is prepared well and served well. Prices are OK"
Simple Yet Exotic Seafood,Simple to the eyes but definitely lots of work to come up with healthy delicious meals with seafood platters
Conveyor-belt of decent food,It is a consistently good place for lunch unless you are looking for something inexpensive and quiet. Make sure you avoid rush hour.
Lovely and healthy,Love the prawn uni pasta and salmon for lunch. Also love the pure coconut water. Simply awesome. Just need to queue during lunch otherwise it's fine. My favorite lunch corner.
Amazing find,Stumbled across this vibrant restaurant for lunch and were very pleasantly surprised. Great small menu with extremely fresh and well thought-out dishes. Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. We will certainly return next time we're in Singapore!
Very overpriced,"I know I know - what isn't overpriced in Singapore? Taxis perhaps but that's it really. But still we ordered one starter to share and two main courses (as we usually do in restaurants) and despite paying top dollar we left hungry. And I don't mean peckish. We were actually hungry and ended up having another dinner. And we are in no way, ekhm, large-bellied so to speak. The food was tasty and served quickly but we couldn't get over the portion sizes... Staff very nice and friendly."
Family dinner,"This was a pleasant meal and the service staff led by Whey Han made it a memorable affair. The dishes were certainly inventive and we enjoyed each one, lovingly presented. We look forward to returning to try their lunch menu."
Consistently good dining experience every visit,"Nude Seafood never cease to amaze me with the excellent service, value for money dining, and innovative menu that they change regularly. Recommended dishes are always spot on. Good mix of fresh seafood : from imported oysters to Chilean seabass done in various fusion styles. And lovely desserts - fusion style as well. The quality of the preparation and the presentation is much akin to fine dining, without paying the cost. Great place to bring friends and family for a treat! The simple but warm ambience, quality of food, friendly and attentive service will always bring me back!"
Excellent dishes and desserts!,"Small selection but excellent menu selection! We tried fresh oysters and rillets as starters! Main courses - fantastic sea bass and barramundi! Home made fresh pasta with ragout and Iberico ballots pork shoulder that taste like duck! Desserts - camomile panacotta - melt in your mouth!

Highly recommend this place - at the ground floor of MBFC tower 3! Fantastic young crew and excellent service tonight!"
Good service,"Food is average, service is good. Ok place for a good lunch during working hours... Can try if you are around Marina Bay Financial Centre."
"A simple, affordable and healthy seafood option in the heart of the business district","Stumbled upon this gem while visiting Singapore for work. From the onset, it is evident that much effort has been spent in crafting the menu, which features Japanese inspired dishes and high quality ingredients. I especially like the use of ancient grains in the menu (quinoa anyone?).

With the help of the friendly server, I decided to go with the Miso-Walnut Snapper and boy was it delicious! The snapper was fresh and nicely grilled and the walnut gave the moist and tender meat an additional crunch. I also liked the quinoa with cured duck, which was flavourful. I finished my lunch with the Hanjuku cheesecake and the raisin sand, which are highly recommended.

Overall, Nude is a great option if you would like something simple, affordable and healthy. However, the portion size can be a little bigger though. Will definitely be back again when I am down in Singapore the next time!"
Great food and attentive staff,First time here and it was a good experience. Was here for dinner on a Monday and it was fairly full (probably 2 or 3 empty tables). It is a nice and cosy place. The staff were attentive and polite. Ordered the live oysters and pan-roasted barramundi filet. They were both EXCELLENT! The oysters were huge (and luckily I managed to stuff them into my mouth at one go!) Will definitely visit again and try out the other dishes!
Great food and lovely people,"I went with 3 friends and we ordered almost everything on their regular dinner menu to share and nothing disappointed.

The highlights for us were the Hokkaido Scallop Carpaccio starter which was refreshing (savour it with the Nori chip they paired it with), the mouthwatering Fritto Misto japanese herring and calamari starter, the housemade pastas that were made to perfection, Iberico De Bellota Pork main which had a very interesting texture and a super kickass potato foam side, Chamomile Panna Cotta dessert and Ginga Kogen beer!

Attentive, friendly service staff and well thought out dishes. Will definitely be back again! :)"
Lovely service and food,I haven't had a good carbonara in a while. The mushroom and leek carbonara was full of flavour and had abundance of mushrooms(which i love). I enjoyed it very much.
Great new dinner,"Love Nude's new dinner! Big change from their casual lunch, it's now an elegant, cosy place serving live oysters, Hokkaido scallops, Chilean bass, and iberico de bellota pork for dinner. Prices still remain very reasonable, from $14 for starters and $20 for mains. These guys obviously love what they do, and do it with flair!"
Excellent Seafood... and Coffee!,Was jam packed at lunch so decided to try the place out for dinner. Excellent gourmet food for not so expensive prices. The scallop started was excellent as well as the baramudi! Will be back
A great dining experience,"The good people at NUDE has got the recipe correct right down every detail. A warm and cosy interior for a good meal and bolstered by a good selection of drinks to complement a meal. Attentive service staff listen and anticipate the needs of the diner. As for the food, I had the privilege to try out about 5 to 6 of their dishes which is constantly refreshed by the chefs. Fresh ingredients, with a lot of thought put in on creative flavoring that makes you want to come back for more to experience it again. Would definitely recommend others to check it out."
