Food to remember,"Great ambiance, and excellent service but it‚Äôs the food that makes this place exceptional. Well presented and bursting with flavour. A great lunch for our family of 6."
Dinner,"Super nice Turkish food upon my family trip! Enjoy the food and the ambience here, definitely worth another round of visiting."
Amazing food and good service!,"Amazing food. An authentic Turkish experience. Nice environment, good service and food really good. They don‚Äôt sell wine, and they went to the other restaurant to get me one. Good customer experience"
Amazing food experience,The food was very authentic and flavourful. Great balance of spices. The chef and staff were very friendly and accomodating (excellent service and we did not wait a long time for food). The chef definitely cooks from the heart and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.
Great food and atmosphere,The best Middle Eastern food that I have had.. The service and quality was second to none. We were a group from Australia and enjoyed every bite. Highly recommended!
Best Persian food with exceptional quality and service.,"Best Persian food in the Arab St area.
I have been here 3 times in the last 5 years and each time the food quality, service and cleanliness is exceptional.
Always freshly made with top ingredients. I highly recommend to visit located just down from the main Mosque across the first road."
Lebanese and Turkish Cuisine,Best restaurant in singapore and very delicious food try mixed grill and mezza plater this is best and seating place very comfortable totally good place.
Lebanese food,Very delicious food and best service Best lamb chops and the mezza platter is amazing and friendly stuff will go again Recommend
Disappointing meal,"I'm surprised this restaurant is rated as highly as it is.

The service and drinks were fine but the food is massively overpriced for the portion size and taste. The food was presented well but it tasted no where near as good as it looked. Every dish lacked flavour unfortunately. One dish in particular was a bit of a joke, the haloummi starter. They charged $18.50 for 4 tiny slices of halloumi which lacked rhe traditional halloumi flavour.

We wouldn't recommend to others, other than for a drink maybe."
Pretty disappointing place,Service was mediocre and the drinks were pretty awful. The folks at the restaurant also tried to get us to continue ordering drinks late even though they knew we would have to rush to finish up the drinks by 10.30pm. Wouldn‚Äôt return to this restaurant.
Guaranteed a good meal!,"Enjoyed the ambiance, the 5 star service and our server Sabrina was super friendly and spunky. I ordered the mezze platter to share, although the portioning could‚Äôve been slightly increased, it was very tasty. My lamb chops were done to perfection as well as hubby‚Äôs lamb shawarma. My friends ordered the mixed grill platter and they also said it was very good. Only negative were the prices of the juices n sodas, quite overpriced. But overall we had a lovely dinner. Will be back!"
Best Lamb Chops,"First time visit , was looking for lamb chops ... The best I must said . Enjoyed the meat dishes very much . Good service !!! Will definitely visit again üëçüëçüëçüëç"

Stepping into Byblos instantly transports you from bustling, metropolitan Singapore to charming Persia complete with colorful artisanal rugs, flowing silky curtains and handcrafted lamps of every shade imaginable. The two male waiters/greeters were cold and both failed to warm up to our banter so we just sheepishly got on with our order; after all, we were here for a good meal and any good service would just have been icing on the cake. Sufficient to fully satisfy two good appetites, the MIXED GRILL ($46.90) offered up hearty servings of grilled chicken, kebabs, kofta, beef and lamb, all accompanied by spiced rice steamed to perfection, some chopped summer salad and three sauce dips (sweet chilli, spicy chilli and garlicky toum). The house special vegetarian Moussaka ($21.90) was a delightful appetizer of moist but not over-cooked aubergine in a rich bed of crushed tomatoes under a crust of baked cheese - the stuff that dreams are made of; the moussaka was served with a moist yet crusty oven hot handmade pita bread ($2.50) which the male server had previously confirmed accompanied the moussaka and was free but we were later charged $2.50 for it. Even though we did not appreciate that sales tactic reminiscent of tourist traps, we did not question this extra item on the bill as it was not a hefty addition. However, we raised an issue when the glass of MINT TEA ($5.50) was surreptitiously charged as a full pot ($12.50); be advised that most drinks are $5+ except for mineral water and juices are $9.50 but these prices are all upfront and not unexpected at tourist areas. The lady waitress we had chatted with earlier was a total delight and she changed the bill for the mint tea without fuss or even taking a second look; we had already been impressed by her warmth and sincerity but this action made Byblos even more endearing. We would have given this place 4.5 stars if it had not been for the billing gaffes which might not have gone down well with some tourists and thus would have given them an imperfect impression of service standards in Singapore. There is no hiding that the regular menu prices at Byblos are hefty and cater to tourists but with promotional reservations in hand, we will certainly return to try other dishes. It was clear that their Turkish chef was very proud of his creations and it showed through the fine food."
Removes LARGE portion of your food when you order it to-go,"I actually enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The food was good, albeit pricey. My wife and I ordered a dish each, the lamb mandi and lamb chops. Both were delicious, but the lamp chops came in 3 small pieces, which at $32.90 I expected more. The lamb mandi was extremely tender and flavorful, and was easily the star of the show. The rice was fluffy and delicious. Service was friendly enough, if a tad slow.
One really irked me was this: because they gave a lot of rice, my wife and I only ate the rice from one dish and left the other plate untouched to bring home for our family, as well as one lamb chop and some of the lamb. In the restaurant, the rice was a huge heap on a large plate. As you can see from the picture however, there was probably just a spoonful or two left in the takeaway box. I was amazed by this as I have never experienced this before. I even checked if any fell out of the box into the plastic bag but it was completely clean. There was definitely way more rice when we ate in the restaurant which somehow evaporated on our journey home. Did the restaurant really have to take food from a paying customer? And not just some, but MOST of the rice that a customer had paid for? This tainted an otherwise decent experience we had.

I guess I should be thankful they didn't touch any of the meat.

PS: The images uploaded includes one from the restaurant's website for reference on the portion size."
Big Serving great Service!,"We visited Byblos Grill last 7 Nov 2020 the ambience is cozy middle eastern concept. The menu was enticing as the photos help us figure out about the food the are offering. We order the Mixed Grill (its a very very huge plate super giant haha) lamb sharma, samak makli(fried fish ) lemonade mint( refreshing) mango juice and for the dessert its really a divine! A must try KUNAFA!!!!!! WE ARE ONLY 2 PERSON we did not expect a huge serving but its fun and super nice even the customer service of the arab or lebanese owner is one of a kind you can see in the photos how generous their servings are"
Best kanuffeh and lamb ever,My favourite was the lamb mundi it was succulent and for a meat lover it was just right not too oily And the dessert kannafeh was delicious too.
Delivery,Ordered the Turkish pizza tgt with lamb kofta n it was delicious.. the delivery was quick n packed nicely. The lamb kofta came with the mandi rice which was so fluffy.. really enjoyed my lunch. Can‚Äôt wait to visit the restaurant!
Visiting Singapore for my first time. Been eating Asian food for 17 days. Needed a change. Love Mediterranean food.,Loved the young sweet Egyptian waiter. He was very cordial and accomodating. Food was delicious and was beautifully presented. I would eat there again.
Byblos grill food is awesome,The food at byblos grill is delicious and fresh shawarma is so delicious and chicken mandi rice was just superb. The staff Mr Ramadan is helpful and friendly. I Highly recommended this restaurant to eat with family and friends.
Nice Lebanese Restaurant,The food was perfect. The staff was very friendly. The manager had offered us a free Lebanese dessert.
"Good food but a bit pricey,",We were all happy with our meals and the service. The koftas were delicious. I think that there are less expensive options in the are.
Very bad experience.. Poor but very expensive food and owners that don‚Äôt care,"We were very hungry and decided to sit in this restaurant that got good scores on the sites. Prices are very expensive compared to Arab food - but we were hungry so we decided to eat there. The food was just disgusting, the dishes arrived late and were missing details we ordered. Really not recommended.
We told the waitress that the food was not tasty, he went to consult the manager and returned with the bill without taking anything off even though we did not touch the food. I would have given it 0 stars if it was possible"
Cant understand the good reviews,"We had just two starters and softdrinks for about 30‚Ç¨. The baked potato was just sliced, mashed with cream and baked with a lot of cheese. The lentils soup was the worst we tried during our trips. Service is overwhelmed. Food is not like on the pictures.
Worst experience."
BYBLOS GRILL üëçüëçüëç,Will visiting friends in. Singapore we visited Arab street . We had lunch at Byblos Grill . A nice Lebanese restaurant . Well priced and very flavoursome . We would go back .
"Nice food, but I wouldn‚Äôt return","We can see Bussorah St from our apartment so checked Trip Advisor and noted Byblos had some good reviews. When we got there the tout was so aggressive we walked passed (with difficulty) and I had to convince my partner to give it a try. The tout tried to explain Lebanese food to us and suggested if we were unhappy with our food we didn‚Äôt have to pay, I laughed advising him that we were from Melbourne and had excellent Lebanese food at home. We ordered a grilled Halloumi Cheese, a Tabbouleh Salad and a mixed grill with lamb kofta, lahem mashwi, chicken kofta, shish tawouk and lamb chops. The halloumi cheese was average (as it always is if you don‚Äôt get halloumi from hot grill to plate instantly), the mixed grill and tabbouleh were nice but outrageously expensive (I can feed my adult family for half the cost and twice the food in Sydney Rd Melbourne). You can get much nicer food in Singapore for a fraction of the cost. I give Byblos 8/10 for atmosphere, 7/10 for food and 3/10 for value for money."
Must be all fake reviews,"For this Restuarant to be rated so highly on trip advisor these reviews must be fake. First off we were harassed to come in and eat here. The man bagged every other Restuarant in the area and said his food was the best and every where else is terrible. If this is the best Lebanese food in Singapore I feel sorry for the a Singaporean who actually think this is good food.
I ordered a chicken wrap with extra pickles. Comes out, the wrap was very thin and their were no pickles. Asked the waiter to bring out the pickles as they must have missed it and he comes back out and says the kitchen has run out. Pickles are a staple in Lebanese cuisine.. how can you run out?! Chips were very undercooked and not appetising.

My partner ordered the lamb shank and was flavourless. Very lemony and had no salt. Salad on the side had no dressing.

When we were there the man at the front did not come and check to see how it was going nor did he thank us as we were leaving. Very rude seeing as he was so friendly when trying to bait us into his restuarant.

Never again will I eat here."
Friendly and tasty,The dishes we ordered were juicy and delicious. The Lebanese spice mix is a nice contrast to the South-East-Asian one. Highlight is the tabletop grill from which some of the dishes are served.
Nice Lebanese,"Had a 4 day stay in Singapore and after a tour of the Arab quarter wanted to have a Lebanese dinner.

This place was highly recommended on TripAdvisor so we have it a go.

Service was very good, location right in the thick if the street so nice atmosphere. Food and drinks were good but I was not convinced it was good value for money compared to other food we had during our stay. We had two mezze's with bread and hommus with two non alcoholic drinks was S$90."
"Delicious, amazing, in the middle of it all.",The food here is amazing. We made a reservation online which was simple to do. At night the streets are closed so our table was outside on the street. There are tables inside too but I loved being in the middle of the action. Everyone working at the restaurant was welcoming and they provide excellent service. The mojitos are tasty and the lavash bread is amazing. Gorgeous Turkish lamps everywhere - this place is the complete package!!
Best Kunafa is the Best in town !,Pleasant and efficient service. Kunafa was serve in warm and presentable. It‚Äôs a must try here. Definitely the best at Arab street. I‚Äôll comeback for it! See u guys around.
Just perfect!!,The service is super kind!!! They had really great offers and an excellent atmosphere! Definitely a good place to have some or some more drinks! :))
Roop,I visited last night at byblos grill the view was osm after that i ordered the food garilc labneh fatttous lavash and see food The food was good as well as staff behave very nice
Arshad,I was visited 2nd in this restaurant food was osm and mostly i like the Moussaka as well as kibbeh and mixed grill
Vegetarian available,"If you are looking for Lebanese food and are a vegetarian, this little joint in Arab street will satisfy you. While it has enough vegetarian dishes on its menu , we opted for the usual hummus and falafel dishes which came with a big pita bread each.
As a main dish we chose the vegetarian mousakka made out of cheese and eggplant .
We had a very refreshing drink of mint and lemon to go with it.
This was enough food for the two of us .
Price wise I would say it was on the higher side but was a decent meal overall .
Nice Arabic music and the Turkish lamps were pretty !"
"Great food and above all, great service!","Wow! Great service, amazing people and one of the best shawarma and baklava I've ever had. The turkish tea with mint has been amazing as well. A great way to end the meal. Mohammed really treated us so well and we were able to have one of our best experience in Singapore! Will definitely come back!"
Great Quality Food and Service,"What a lovely surprise. We had a lovely night with friends. We ordered the lamb chops, chicken kebabs, fatuous he along with some excellent labneh and hummus. All was seriously good quality, my favourite was the lamb.

Mohamad, the owner, was so friendly and chatty and the chef came out to say hi too.

Highly recommended. We will be back!"
Amazing Waiter!!!,Waiter RamanGill is really helpful and always around to check if there is anything else we'd like to order etc. Very efficient and this place is lovely as well. Everyone works well as a team. Would come here over and over again for sure!!!
Superb experience with authentic hospitality,"On July 1, 2019 we enjoyed Chef's Salim's highest standards of Lebanese cuisine. A warm and authentic welcome was a great start and we enjoyed delicious mixed grill, salmon fillet, heavenly grilled tiger prawn, chicken shawarma. The sweet desserts kunafa and baklava with super coffee ended this great experience. We choose a character full Italian wine that tasted full bodied and we asked it chilled. Our Egyptian and Indian waiters served great and we had meaningful talks with them. Chef Mohamad Salim and staff gave us the chance to dive into a real new food experience for us. Picture taking with the staff finalized an unforgettable evening in and around Bussorah Street in Singapore. When we come back from the Philippines and before flying back to Belgium, we will come back on Aug. 26 for lunch this time. More power to Byblos! Dominiek and Leah Segaert-Gallego, Magalie, Irene & Ivy Gallego"
Amazing time! Great food!,Great food and excellent service! Staff were attentive and knowledgeable. Amazing environment. Recommended. I had a great time with my partner! Would definitely return!
"Cool Ambience, Authentic Food!","It‚Äôs a restaurant you shouldn‚Äôt miss when you‚Äôre in Singapore, for authentic Middle -Eastern food. Great ambience."
Incredible dinner!,"We were lucky enough to find Byblos last night and it was fantastic! The service was great- esp. Mahmoud who was attentive and friendly to all customers during a very busy time. We had the Mezza platter, falafel, lamb schawarma wrap and Kofta lamb; we absolutely over-ordered, but have no regrets since everything was so delicious! Very cold beer was much appreciated, too, after a hot day of walking around."

"Lively ambience, good food","We were dining here on a Saturday evening with my wife. We had reserved a table in advance, not mandatory but the place was almost full already so I think it is a good thing to do. Most of the tables are on the street, but indoor seating also possible.
The food was great, we had some halloumi, falafel and lamb korma from the grill. All of them excellent, and the dishes came fast.
There was live music on the street which was nice. At some point there was different music coming from several restaurants that was a bit annoying so some coordination by the restaurants would be good. The street is filled with Lebanese and Turkish restaurants so its is a vibrant place and perfect for just watching the buzz.
The service was very good, fast, attentive. Everything worked.
I could come here again, a nice experience overall.
One could continue the evening in some of the many bars around there but we skipped it this time."

Great food,"Friendly service however we were unfortunate that something in the kitchen broke on the night and left us waiting for a long period of time for our meal. In acknowledgement staff gave us a complimentary drink and dessert.
Overpriced for what we actually got but nice nonetheless.
We were promised 20% discount by man on the street encouraging business however this was not reflected on the bill at the end."

Fantastic late evening find!,"We happened upon this wonderful restaurant after a late arrival in Singapore, a bit concerned we were too late for supper. Fantastic fresh, hot, very, very tasty food was served within 10 mins of our placing the order. Great service and atmosphere too! Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more!"
Best food on the street!,"I was walking down the Arab quarters, there were a lot of callers on the street. However I was enticed by this particular restaurant as they promised good food or money back guarantee.

I had the lamb mandi which was tender and melted in the mouth. I had freshly baked bread with the hummus. My husband had the mousakka and it was creamy. They even tailor made a menu for my kids. Which was impressive. Staff was very friendly and always there to explain the dishes."

Fun street and good food,"Went here with a couple of my friends. This was my first visit to Haji Lane area and it was quite an experience! The entire streets were packed with people, mostly families who were trying to enjoy the nice weekend weather. We got a table outside and the street was very lively. There was a band playong live music in the middle of the street. We never quite figured out if they were associated with one particular restaurant or all of them. Regardless, everyone was enjoying them.

Food was prepared pretty quickly amd was brought to the tables fresh and hot. The big breads were excellent and so was the lamb shawarma. Definitely worth going there for the experience of a bustling street and some really good food."
Food and drink,Raman was great had a great time Excellent food and drinks Will definitely recommend it Will come back
Best time in My trip,I advice if you like Arabic food you have to go peplose and staff so nice food very fast come so yummy try will never regert
Like it so much,For my exprience this the best arabic food baba gnoug and mix gril with rice very good and enoug good to try
Love it,I go to this restaurant alone but I really so regret never bring my wife and kids but next time bring all my friends and family for this nice food and services
we loved Bybos Grill,"We are visiting Singapore on our way home to NYC, and we stopped at Bybos Grill for dessert. The menu looked great, so we orderd more food - foul, lebneh, and beetroot salad - before the knafeh and everything was delicious. The staff is also very nice."
What we did not like,"We made a booking.
Upon arrival no table was ready for us. The staff of the restaurant is more focus on getting walk in customers than serving the ones sitting.
Once we got a table we ordered quickly as we are familiar with Lebanese cuisine.
Then it took 30 long minutes before our drinks landed on the table and after reminding several times the waiters.
Then the manager came to say sorry and inform us the food will arrive in ""2 minutes"". 5 minutes later 2 dishes arrive but wrong ones.
We decided to leave after waiting total time 50 minutes.
I offered to pay for the 2 drinks but the cashier said no while the manager was probably hiding.
Bad experience."
Best food,I went there with my family they liked the food and the manger mahmoud very very nice guy and good service hope you try guys
Delicious lunch and wonderful service!,"We had an incredible lunch at Byblos Grill - started with the Mezze Platter and really enjoyed the different types of dips and salads. The chicken was also so good - flavorful and nicely seasoned. Mostly though, the service stood out: it was AMAZING. They were so kind, bringing us a frothy orange juice and a really yummy dessert to try, and giving us great recommendations for what to explore. They were attentive but not overbearing and it was very comfortable to spend a leisurely lunch enjoying all of the wonderful food! Would highly recommend."
Excellent service and delicious grill,We went as a family of three. Ordered the mix grill and it was all delicious. Restaurant is clean and Staff helpful and friendly. Highly recommended.
Great lunch,High light of Arab street if u are really look for good food and service will be here Byblos grill and they serve humus with fresh bread lavah so amazing and mix grill is the best staff very friendly and helpful sure we come again
"Good food a bit overpriced, service mediocre","The good news is that the food is really good. If you wanna authentic middle eastern food, this is the spot. The main qualm was the price which was 130$ for 2 people for dinner. A tiny little thing of hummus with bread is 15 usd. And each beer is about $10 usd. But as I said, the food is very very good so maybe I am just a cheapskate."
Team lunch,Food were very good and service was exceelent we like lamb chop very tender and lamb mandi so soft dont miss hallumi and lavassh fresh bread staff vert kind sure we come again
Great Dining Experience,"We had a superb meal at Byblos Grill, you couldn‚Äôt meet nicer people. Combine this with beautiful food and a great outdoor setting and you get a memorable dining experience. I asked for ice cream for my son and they went across the street and purchased it for us and didn‚Äôt even charge us! After paying our bill the staff then arrived with two complimentary glasses of wine and dessert to the table. This is a restaurant motivated to make your evening as enjoyable as possible. Highly recommend."
Amazing food and service!,"Nice ambience and cool decorations. Service was good, they were full house when I came but they gave me some lebanese cheese and pita bread on the house to fill my stomach while waiting for the main course. Bread was freshly baked and came to the table soft and warm. I had the Chicken Kabsa which was out of this world. The chicken was juicy and tender. I am definitely coming back. I highly recommend Byblos Grill!"
Very good food and staff,Very good staff and kind so nice so delicious sureci come again for another visit dont miss lamb chop and lemon mint
Touristy spot without Lebanese authenticity in the food,"Arab style restaurant were dishes were not remarkable in terms of quality, authenticity or amount. After years in the Middle East I get the level high, but none of the three of us (my two friends are neophytes in the Lebanese cuisine) was convinced. My friends paid 200 sing $ for 3 people and we brought our wine from home. It was a clear tourist trap. After the meal they were disappointed and we went home. Night was over."
Magic food and service,We h√°d alot of food specially h√∫mus and Kibbeh and aryes kofta and we had cold beer and staff very friendly and they offered us free dessert sure we come agian
Lebanese cuisine in Singapore,"I am a big fan of Oriental/Mediterranean food, Turkish, Moroccan, Greek and Lebanese. This is one of the best I tried, a place for connoisseur of this kind of cuisine. Everything is home made from the bread, juice, hummus to cordon bleue. It makes a difference on the taste. Chicken was nicely grilled, tender on the inside tasty on the outside. On top of that, service is first class. I highly recommend."
Amazing food and service,"Food is excellent we had hummus, babaganoush, chicken moussaka and chicken fatteh. Also we want to highlight the incredible service by Sabrina. We will come back soon."
Top Class!,"Went there with my wife and two other couples on busy Saturday night with reservation.
Everything about our experience was top class.
Service was attentive with staff who genuinely looked like they enjoyed their job!
Food was served promptly, well presented and most important, was fantastic!
At the end of the night the manager and head chef came to our table to check if everything was ok and also gave us some free drinks - not something you get too often in Singapore.
Highly recommend."
Very good food,Food very nice very delicious specislly rice very soft and staff very kind very helpful sure i come again
Pre-prepared food not as good as the pictures or reviews,Best thing was the Lavash bread and the falfael. Everything else was pre-cooked and warmed including the fried cheese. Would not advise going here.
Team dinner,Excellent food and services we had alot of food mezza platter were very nice and mix grilled platter and borak so nice tabuallah salad amazing and aryes kofta so delicious this my third time ans i will still keep coming warm staff and very freindly sure i recommed it
Great lunch,Very good food and very good service specially lamb chop so tender dont miss mousaka so nice staff very friendly and helpful sure we come again
Best Lebanese Restaurant in singapore,"I go to Singapore a lot for business and am a big fan of Arabic food as I used to live in Lebanon.
Food is authentic and staffs are friendly. My personal favourite is their lamb mandi. Lamb is so succulent and rice rich in flavour. The owner and Chef, Mr. Mohamad, goes around the restaurant and makes an effort to speak to customers which is a nice touch. Also, this is the only Lebanese restaurant in Singapore with a Lebanese Chef! Authentic indeed!"
