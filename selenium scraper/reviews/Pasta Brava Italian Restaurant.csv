Hawker centres have better pastas,"I've come here twice and been disappointed twice. Ordered the famed squid ink pasta and it was so painfully mediocre. Ordered the saffron cream pasta and it was just a few sheets of pasta drowning in cream. The seafood was obviously frozen for both dishes. For such a high price point, I expected a lot more. I've had better pastas at a hawker centre. Italian food isn't even hard to make. Singapore is teeming with amazing Italian restaurants, I don't know how Pasta Brava still exists."
3-course lunch,"We stumble across this gem of a restaurant as it was raining. But, we were pleasantly surprised by the service and the food. The Garden salad was fresh and crisp. The mushroom soup was smooth and silky. My chicken with mash potato was a filling, and my wife's beef lasagna was exquisite with overflowing of cheese! Finally, we finish off our meals with Tiramisu and Toffee Panna Cota (sorry if this is misspelled2222222)"
Not like before,"the serving reduced. At 8pm, we were told their famous chocolate lava cake is out of stock. very disappointing meal. my children confirmed that they are not coming back."
Absolute Gem,"This is an absolute Gem! Delicious authentic food, warm friendly and helpful staff. They do a chocolate red wine sauce with their steak which is to die for. Amazing all round, I‚Äôll be going again and again."
Disappointing experience,"Was guided to this restaurant on the basis of their menu that was posted on their website. Unfortunately the actual menu didn't resemble the online one and this was acknowledged by the staff without apology. Something about needing to get around to changing their website. The food that followed was hugely underwhelming. The pizza was dry and lacked much topping and flavour. The salmon dish was poorly presented and had lacklustre vegetable accompaniments.
The venue itself is ok and the staff friendly. Didn't appreciate having one waiter try to ""up sell"" everything we ordered.
All in all a disappointing experience."
Average food but good service,"The food was quite average. The recommended lobster tomato pasta was too salty and sweet for my tasting. Calamari was rather small and salty. Overall, food quality was not really worth the price. But the service was quite good. May not return there again."
Tasty !!!,"Mushroom soup is smooth . The pasta Lobster damn fresh , Next visit would try the lobster pizza !!!!"
Food was aWesome. Staff were very helpful and polite. We enjoy the pork tomahawks .Thumbs up guys. Keep it up.üëç,Great service and food I must say. Pizza and Keto selections was really good. They also have a range of wines selections that was good. Overall was experience was great. Will come back soon .
Disappointing,"The Scarlet Hotel is nice but the restaurant lacks the Italian atmosphere and enthusiasm of the original Craig Road location with its Sicilian boss.
My ravioli arrived within minutes of being ordered.. it had to go back as it was cold. There was no offer of bread, free or not & sadly it‚Äôs nothing like the old Pasta Brava."
Authentic Italian Cuisine,Been searching for Fresh squid ink pasta and not the ink pasta. Guys this place serves wonderful fresh squid ink pasta and it was wonderful.
A restaurant to avoid,"With so many Italian restaurants in town competition is keen. Pasta Brava in the hands of a new owner is not going to make it. Ingredients, taste and attitude all sub par. Good luck to the new owner. She needs it."
Terrible Valentine‚Äôs Day evening,"Girlfriend and I had booked a month in advance to celebrate not only Valentine‚Äôs Day but our anniversary. We were eagerly looking forward to the food given the great reviews posted online and also the fabulous write ups indicated on the menu. We had opted in for the 4 course Valentine‚Äôs Day special.

We were keen on the sea bass and ribs but upon arrival at 7pm we were told that the sea bass had run out. We then compromised to have the lamb ravioli and ribs, while other couples that came at 7.30pm were not so lucky and were told that even the ribs had run out leaving 3/5 options.

We were served appetisers only to be asked later on again if appetisers had been already served to us by the waiters. The promised love ‚Äúcocktail‚Äù was a mocktail that consisted of mostly syrup. We were then further shocked when the ravioli came with only 3 pieces. Overall, portions were small and service was lackluster. I had come with great expectations of the place but was terribly let down.

Please avoid this establishment, I‚Äôve had better food and service at other pasta places at a more reasonable price."
Bad Valentine‚Äôs Day dinner not worth the price $118++,"Ala cart menu not available. Starters only mushroom soup and 3 slice sashimi. Main was 3 piece of risotto , sea bass and penne palm size. Dessert was some sponge cake. Disappointed not worth the price"
"New year, new location, new experience",Had great pastas as before when Pasta Brava was at Craig road. They moved to Scalet Hotel near maxwell market. Food was just as great! Great service too!
"New place, almost the same food!","New place at Erskine Road looks fancy and cosy. Food and service was also good as usual, apart from the one dish we always order which is their Truffle Cream Pasta. They have not been as generous with the truffle and the sauce. Could only taste hints of truffle and sauce was a lot lesser than what we used to have. I'd rather pay more for it to enjoy it even more."
Restaurant very romantic. Very suitable for couples or friends gathering.But food a bit expensive than others restaurant,Restaurant very romantic. Very suitable for couples or friends gathering.But food a bit expensive than others restaurant.
Handmade pastas!,"Ordered the set lunch that came with mushroom soup, a salad, a main (we ordered their handcrafted gnocchi with tomato sauce and smoke ricotta) and a choice of vanilla/chocolate icecream. Portion sizes were decent and left feeling full and satisfied! Really worth given the large selection of handmade and high quality pastas. I especially loved their gnocchi which didn‚Äôt have too much of a doughy/floury texture as many other eateries do + the taste of potatoes was retained. They made the right choice of pairing it with the tomato sauce so that it wouldn‚Äôt be too heavy. Worth mentioning is their caprese appetizer - the cheese and tomato slices were really really fresh! Perfect combination when eaten with olive oil and vinegar.

Service here was great as well. All the staff were really friendly and introduced the dishes to us with great detail. Thanks for the good experience!"
Good pasta and meat,"Service and excellent and the ambience was cozy. We ordered the tomahawk steak and seafood pasta. The food portions were generous and the steak was tender and juicy. Overall, quite satisfied with the experience at the restaurant."
Good Quality Food,"5/5 experience at Pasta Brava. Waiter was extremely polite, helpful and recommended the Portobello Mushroom Appetiser and Home-Made Pasta Scallops. Food portion is just nice and I will definitely come back to try out the other dishes."
Good food and ambience,"Good food and ambience, service is amazing as well. Particularly likes the portobello mushroom starter, will definitely pop by again when i am around the corner"
Tasty pasta,"I had their garlic bread to start and their linguine regina del mare as my main. The pasta was absolutely delicious with the savory seafood and rich tomato sauce, would recommend!"
Seafood Spaghetti,"Enjoyable dining experience with a comfortable atmosphere. The Spaghetti Marinara came with a generous serving of 2 crayfish, cooked to perfection, with a rich, chunky tomato sauce. Looking forward to trying more dishes on my next visit."
Great Pastas,"Pasta Brava is a cosy Italian restaurant with excellent service that serves a wide variety of Italian dishes. The Lobster Bisque was intensely flavourful and mildly spicy, and the Carbonara Fettuccine with Smoked Bacon was rich but not too creamy."
Lovely pasta place!,"Love the food and ambience here! I ordered their Carbonara with Linguine as my choice of pasta, and their Italian apple cake with ice cream! Great way to end my day. Thank you for the good food and wonderful service!"
Go for the handmade pastas,"really enjoyed the stracci al gamberi e capesante - homemade pasta that's super soft and soaked in a truly great saffron cream sauce. it's unique and something that makes me want to come back again!

Lobster spaghetti is a little pricey and sticky date pudding is just alright. Will go back to try more of the homemade pastas!"
Amazing Italian Food!,"Amazing Italian food with authentic Italian ambience! The food was so good and the serving is just right, definitely more filling than I expected. A very nice place to hang out with your friends or partner as the environment was great. The staffs are very friendly and welcoming, making it a very pleasant visit. If you love pasta, you must check this place out!"
Amazing Italian Pastas,"Went there for our date night and this place didn‚Äôt disappoint. We got the lobster pasta and their signature stracci ai gamberi e capesante and was really impressed with their pastas. While both pastas were really flavourful, I would say that if there‚Äôs one that you MUST order, it would be the stracci ai gamberi e capesante. It is their house signature for a reason and the sauce is like no other that I‚Äôve tasted. Got the sticky date pudding to end the dinner off on a sweet note. Will be back again to try the other dishes!"
Lovely dining experience,"Had the Tortellini (with minced beef and parma ham), and I was really impressed with it! The very friendly and helpful server also mentioned that it‚Äôs handmade pasta, so plus point for that! Ended with their Tiramisu as well, was not too sweet and everything you‚Äôd expect in a good dessert. Their menu has so many other interesting dishes, can‚Äôt wait to come back and try them out! :D"
Authentic Italian restaurant,"Authentic Italian food with Italian ambience, suitable for a dinner date with your partner or even a chill gathering with friends. My partner and I both ordered STRACCI AI GAMBERI E CAPESANTE and I requested for it to be prepared in Aglio Olio style instead of the original saffron cream sauce. Despite the serving being smaller than expected, it is still very filling to the tummy. The staffs are very welcoming as well, a recommended place for pasta lovers :)"
Authentic Italian Restaurant,Authentic Italian restaurant with wide variety menu selection. Their homemade Ravioli filled with minced beef and light gorgonzola cheese sauce is not overpowered but yet flavorful. Good finishing with their signature Tiramisu paired with Espresso.
Authentic Italian Restaurant,"This is a lovely 31-year old Italian restaurant serving authentic Italian food. Excellent food and warm service making you feel at home. The prawn starter saut√©ed with olive oil, garlic, fresh tomatoes and parsley is simple but yet tasty. Looking forward to visit their new outlet at Scarlet Hotel!"
Excellent pasta but pricey,I would say their pasta is excellent but the price is really on the high side. Service is good and the atmosphere is quite casual.
"Used to be my favorite pasta restaurant, but not anymore","Before the pandemic, Pasta Brava used to be my favorite hangout place for dates and for good pasta. However, during my recent visit on 16 July 2021, i was very disappointed. Firstly, not only did the prices of the food increased, the portion were being reduced. Furthermore, the ingredient (mainly seafood) were not even fresh. I understand that the pandemic was tough for them. However, this doesn't justify them with the poor standard of food and higher pricing. The food Portions were so small that my friends and I went to have Korean BBQ right after the meal. Its really sad that they are where they are now. Will i visit again? The answer is No, although i must say that their customer services were quite pleasing."
Old Favourite Slipping,"Would have to agree with a lot of previous reviews, have been a number of times Since 2008 and back then food and ambience was great. Now looks tired and old. Depleted menus and sub par food - was the go place in Singapore for Pasta pre 2015 - my only conclusion is this must be under new ownership as standards slupped."
Great Anniversary spent at Pasta Brava,"Awesome dining experience w good food and ambience. Will def revisit. Also, the staff‚Äôs attitude is really friendly and great!"
"Good ambience, great food and cosy for small group/couples","Good ambience, nice a little corner of Tg Pagar. Great food (although a little pricey) and great for small groups or couples. Better to make reservations in advance and take note of the min spend. I probably check it out for special occasions rather than on a regular basis"
Good Italian fare,Good Italian fare. From their Burrata with tomatoes and salad to Seafood with Black Squid ink pasta and mains were great tasting meals. The Ossobuco was great as well as the filet tenderloin with chocolate and wine. Service was friendly and price is mid range. Ambience is romantic and well decorated in a heritage shophouse. Menu is limited to their best selling classics.
Just Not Good Enough,"The Parmaham with melon was lacklustre. Quality of the ham not great and serving portion was meagre. Had the Linguine Regina as main, and not blow away either. Portion was not generous. Ordered the tiramisu and sticky pudding as desserts, but we were sorely disappointed. The tiramisu lacks the moistness and coffee liquer. Bascially , it tasted like a piece of creme cake and the sticky date pudding was akin to eating the huat kuehs ( ""chinese steamed cake"" ). Decided to convey the feedback on the tiramisu to the restuarant for their improvement and was met with following reply by the manager informing "" is this the first time we are eating the tiramisu ? We used premium coffee beans and it is home made "" She is totally missing the point here. The tiramisu is just not good enough for an italian restuarant's standard. It does not matter whether is it home baked. The cake needs further improvement. Overall the meal was not satisfactory and definitely needed have much room to improve. The only redeeming point is the waitors are polite and nice"
Drop in standard,"Ate there for lunch couple of yrs ago and was an enjoyable meal. However, the latest visit was such a disappointment. The taste of stracci i had was like Macd's fillet o'fish and the prawn n scallop were really tiny. My friend ordered the same as she had it back in Jan this yr during a lunch and she also felt that the taste was somehow different vs what she had back 2 mths ago. Other friends who had the fish had good feedback though.
As for the desserts, we had tiramisu, apple cake and sticky date cake to share. None of these stood out, just plain with Apple cake being overly sweet.

The service was a mixed bag as one of the staff was rather rude and unhelpful who kept saying that we've got to go to the counter as we do not have a table no despite already telling him it was the counter staff who asked us to go upstairs to wait as our table would be on level 2. He continued to complained to the other staff who subsequently took over to serve us."
"Great food, even better service!","I had a great experience dining at pasta brava. Food was delicious, authentic. Reminded me of Italy! What made the experience better was the service provided by Gian. Gian is very knowledgeable about wines, and recommended a bottle that my partner and me enjoyed tremendously. He was patient, eager and very attentive in service. Thank you Pasta brava and Gian!"
extremely overpriced,"paid $200 in total for their vday set menu (which they did not mention about at all when i booked);

anyway, had a starter consisting of seemingly microwaved raviolis plus 2 mains and desserts that were all of pathetic portions; only saving grace were the ambience and the service provided, but heck, that still does not warrant the $200 price tag of the meal"
Crowded Italian Restaurant,Food are nice but the place is too noisy for gathering. Need to raise our voice when talking which is very tiring.
First visit and it's such a disappointment,"When I arrived at the restaurant, there was a huge crowd of people outside and inside the restaurant. Nobody bothered to take temperature, check safe entry, and manage the crowd by social distancing. The staffs also didn't bother to check for my table and eventually, they asked us to go to their next door's cafe - Sofi Cafe. They take a long time to take our order, and we also waited very long for our food to be served. The food presentation is bad, and so is the taste of the food. I've heard good reviews of Pasta Brava but I'm not sure why the food quality, service and ambience are so terrible. I don't think my friends and I will ever go back, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
Christmas Eve dinner,"Had a great time there as usual! Super service, great food and ambiance. Really worth the wait due to the holiday season!!"
"Great food, good ambience and great service","The waiters were polite and friendly, even helpful to write down what they wanted to say as I am deaf. The food's great and I like the 'feel' of the restaurant too!"
Becoming worst.,"We are, what we can consider, regular customer, or at least used to be with the previous owner.
Since new management, we did came few times and to be fair standart is not what it use to be. And that's extremelly disapointing!
Very average service, no more bread offered, paper napkins for lunch even if you pay the same price as dinner...
Food wise, well, no consistency. Smaller pasta portion, diluted flavours, very light Tiramisu with NO coffee or coffee liquor taste, and the worst was the lava Chocolate cake : no chocolate taste but extremely salty instead....

As I said, used to love the place but it seems now we will have to find a new place... Sad...!"
fantastic place,"have been here many times. everything seems so perfect. food was awesome, service was fantastic. went there during weekends. the place was full of people. we waited for our table to be ready. it was pretty fast that the tabke was ready for us. even though it was overwhelming, the service staff is very attentive to us. anplace must visitand will come back for more"
"Dirty dishes, bad service, filthy smelly bathroons","This used to be a nice restaurant. It has gone WAY downhill and no longer deserves the good reputation it used to carry.

The first sign that something is wrong - the menus are ancient and dirty. Made of paper and held together with scotch tape, covered in dirty fingerprints and with sections crossed out in black marking pen. Obvious signs that things were better a long time ago and that somebody else is now running the shop.

Went to the gents to wash my hands. Wet floor and the room smelled like rotten eggs. Soap dispenser was broken and replaced with soap pump from the supermarket. No paper towels.

Came back to my table and my girlfriend was server water in a dirty glass and wine in a dirty glass. Waiter could not be bothered to look to see if he was using or serving with clean stemware.

I looked at my fork and it had dried crusted crud on the underside, also hadn't been cleaned.

I desperately wanted to leave but we had an very elderly diner with us and moving him would have been a major chore, so I soldiered on.

Asked for the manager and informed her that her dishwasher wasn't doing his or her job and that her staff was equally useless.

Manager was apologetic, explained new person was washing dishes, etc. That's all fine, but it is the waiter's job to set the table and to care to check that they are using clean dishes. The whole staff clearly can't be bothered because we were given six separate pieces of dirty silverware and dishes, two more after I had spoken with the manager.

The ""ick"" factor was palpable. How dirty is the kitchen? Is anybody washing their hands? I could not wait to leave.

The sign on the door gives the restaurant an ""A"" rating for cleanliness. It expired in September of this year but is still on the door. I seriously wonder if they could pass an inspection today.

NEVER AGAIN. There are far better choices in this town. Everything dies eventually. Time to pull the plug on this sad corpse."
Awesome food and service,"Heard about this restaurant and never visit before. Lots of my friends told me about the good food and Service at pasta brava.

Decided to try with my friends. Once u enter, we will be greeted with a warm welcome. That feels so nice. The food was great, taste was right. Service was awesome. Will be back again soon."
Average Food,"Ordered two starters, one soup and two main. Overall food is average and not worth the price that we were paid for. We were allocated the table nearest to the entrance with a bunch of people standing quite close to our table, talking non-stop while waiting for the tables. We wouldn't mind if we are eating at a food court or hawker centre. They should have waiting outside until the table is available and ready. Disappointed."
Great food and ambience!,"The waiters were friendly and helpful, even gave recommendations on their popular dishes. Both the linguine and risotto were really yummy! The restaurant is also cozy with a really nice ambience."
First time here and will be back again,This is the place to go if you want to have real good pasta!! Was craving for Italian food and chance upon this place by accident. Did not regret walking in as I was served by really attentive staffs and had one of the best meal
Consistently good Italian fare!,"Had the pasta Mesuline with pumpkin and capsicum and Linguine de Mare. Both tasted awesome. Hardly disappointed with the Italian cooking here. Always good tasting, good service and consistently yum! Had their toffee sticky dates cake and pudding which tasted good but not wow! Cappuccino was also good!"
Authentic Pasta!,"Price was on the steep side, but worth every buck! believe the pasta was handmade, which gave it a springy texture. We also ordered the raviolli, which is quite small portioned even though it was soo good!"
Best Italian food in Singapore,"Pasta Brava is such a special place. I have been coming here for years and I believe it has the best Italian food in Singapore. I celebrate all my special occasions here - birthdays, engagement, farewell dinners... I always tell myself I will order something different the next time, but every time I come here I end up ordering the same dishes: the scallops gratin appetiser, ravioli con carne, and the molten lava chocolate cake. And I never want to share my dessert! I will never get tired of the food and every time I invite someone new they always fall in love with the place and food too. During the first lockdown I was hoping that they would survive the pandemic because I would be so devastated if they went out of business. As soon as we could dine out again I booked a table. It's great to see that the restaurant is picking up again after months of takeaway only. Thank you Pasta Brava for the years of memories and good food."
Review,"We had Tomato based Linguine, Squid ink risotto and bacon carbonara. Linguine and risotto was really sumptuous however carbonara could be better in terms of e cream thickness. Apart from that, the cook of the pasta are leaning to slightly hard rather than soft texture, which is to my liking."
Food was good. But mess ups from the servers on 2 different occasions :(,"This was 2nd time in 3 weeks. My first time was great except the waiter served my mixed seafood and pasta to a wrong table! The next visit, we added 1 more order of a Linguine Del Mare, with Agio Olio sauce. IT CAME PLAIN WITH NO SEAFOOD. The waiter said I had to order it as Linguine DEL MARE AOP. Who will know this secret code?! And who would forsake their seafood for $2-3 more?"
PASTA LOVERS,"First time there and the Atmosphere, meal and service was great! Ordered penne pesto, squid ink risotto and seafood linguine . All the seafood in the meal was great as well (no empty shells haha and fresh) , yummy! Tho it is a little pricey (around 26-30$) per dish it was worth the try"
"Starter, Main and Desert","Well, the grilled vegetables were average and the Italian bread selection was poor in texture and flavour. The ravioli for main course was fantastic, the mushroom risotto was watery and flavourless. The most memorable part of the meal was the disappointing deserts. A tiramisu that was lacking authentic flavour and any sign of soft cheese flavour, and a molten chocolate cake that lacked punch and was basically tasteless, sadly! Perhaps other items are more satisfying....."
Family lunch 24 July 2020,"This is my second visit to the establishment! The first one the staff lacked warmth in their service, however I liked the food & ambience and decided to visit again on 24th July for lunch with my mom & sis. This time round it was a better. A slightly more matured service staff attended to our table and he much more friendlier and engaging. Loved their seafood pasta, Pasta Vongole & of course the deserts! Tiramisu is a must! Soft and not to strongly flavored with liquer."
Great Pasta Ever!!,If you looking for good pasta. Please come and try here. It is the best pasta I tried ever. Price may be high a bit but it is value for money.
Handmade Pasta Heaven,"Great handmade pasta and the taste is amazing. Me and My boyfriend order a botle of good Italian wine. It was fantastic too. ( This was extra but , 100 min words , so i gotta say something! xD )"
Good experience but overall sub-par food this occasion,"It's post covid so I understand the difficulty in getting back to shape and speed. There's lots of pressure so thanks everyone for you efforts. Our experience wasn't necessarily a 1 off: in my 3 visits here it's been above average but overall I wouldn't want to pay the premium $$$-$$$$ prices. Atmosphere is nice and homely, good for dates. Service wasn't the best but you guys are working hard I appreciate it! I'm sure it'll be back to normal though. Food, most importantly, was a little disappointing this time. Meals came out barely warm (not very appetising), the sauce in my tortellini was watery and not so flavourful, and everything didn't come together though it was the right set of ingredients. I hope they'll take this feedback and once they get back to speed, incorporate it to become a better version of themselves. Thanks for your efforts and for having us :)"
Very good experience,We went with 2 other couples. Lots of vegetarian options. Good food and wine. Saut√©ed mushrooms were excellent. Friendly staff. A bit crowded and small seating so tables are very close to each other. But all in all it was good and will go again.
disappointing service and food,"our recent visit to the restaurant ended with us walking out without having our main courses. the restaurant was rather empty when we arrived but service was already lacking. we had to ask for the drink list, ask for our orders to be taken, and constantly ask for our food to be served. our lobster bisque came in a miserable small bowl without any lobster meat and barely lukewarm, all for ~$14. we have to ask for the soup to be returned to the kitchen and the service staff was not even apologetic. and yes, you have to ask for bread roll too. it is $3 for 4 tiny slices of cold baguette which was served only when we finished our re-heated soup. the worst was when they forgotten about our main courses. we had to ask the service staff to check on our orders, many times. After the people at the next table (who arrived later) finished their dinner, we gave up and asked for our bill. we noticed that cooked food were lying at the counter waiting to be served. and the service staff were actually having a conversation with food in their hands. this is extremely unhygienic. the restaurant also try to pack in so many tables that it becomes very uncomfortable. for the price bracket there are seriously many options which are much better. in fact there are much better options at a lower price bracket. this is definitely our last visit to the restaurant."
Costly Preprepared Food,"We visited this restaurant numerous years ago and were pleased. However, when going back, we were not happy with the food at all. We noticed that all dishes came quite quickly and could not have been made at the time we ordered them. For example, our Eggplant Parmigiana came in under 5 minutes despite the fact it is a grilled dish. When served, it was also only lukewarm. This led to our suspicion that the food at this restaurant is preprepared and not made freshly at the time of ordering. Despite this, the restaurant is pricy, equivalent to other fine dining restaurants that provide fantastic Italian food. Not recommended."
A Little Bit of Italy,"I initially was put off by a bad review but saw most of the others were very positive. I am in the latter group. Pasta Brava is a sort distance by cab from the center of Singapore and is well worth the trip. It is away from the glitz and bustle of the center of town. It is located in an older building. The interior is warm and 180 degrees from the in vogue contemporary design that is common place today. Ambience is warm and inviting. There are two levels with the upper level open on weekends.

We went with another couple one night and returned the next night by ourselves.A good sign that this is a good place was the presence of locals and only a few tourists (4-5).
We had the bruschetta, the mushroom soup, minestrone, insulata con cubeti di verdure, rigatoni with tomato and basil sauce, pasta brava spaghetti del pescatore and stacci al gamberi e capesante. The pasta was al dente and the flavors of the dishes nicely spiced. Lily is th manger and came by to make sure we were happy with our dishes."
Not worth it,"In contrast to some of the experiences depicted below the service was actually fine. Food is ok at best, a lot seems pre-prepared. Found the portions small. Hence overall very overpriced. Drinks likewise. Quite nice interior design for sure but overall not worth the commute..."
Good home made food,"Good portions and home made style food. Substantial. Service is so so. I cant understand why they ask me to keep my fork and knife after I finish eating the starter......just bring a new set no?
Atmosphere was very traditional italian, like an old trattoria.
Not a big selection of softdrinks."
Nice atmosphere and good food,"I went with my family after walk on a Saturday evening. The food and service was excellent. Simple, fresh, delicious Italian food! Would highly recommend."
"Mediocre food, poor service","Family dinner on Christmas eve. Ordered mainly pasta, soup and 1 seafood dish.
Food was mediocre at best, with the crayfish not tasting particularly fresh.
Lobster bisque not served with bread and was told bread was charged separately (from $3). Bread when served was a typical baguette that tastes as good as from an average bakery... not Italian at all.
Biggest let down was when we ordered desserts. Ordered tiramisu but was served apple cake instead. Waiter insisted we ordered apple cakeeven though I said I do not eat apple cake. Then he insisted to bring the menu, which was totally irrelevant. Not rude but definitely not an authentic Italian Restaurant and not good service"
Terrible service,"Terrible service! On entering the restaurant my friend and I had to wait a good 15 minutes to be seated though staff were standing around. When we asked if we would be served bread with our meal, we were told that we were only allowed one piece each! When we complained to the manager about the poor service, he gave us an email address to write to and encouraged us to complain. To TOP it all off, we were charged for mineral water (though we did not order any) and asked if we wanted to sign up as members! Will walk a little further to Etna in future.."
Love their ravioli!,"Went to this restaurant for dinner. We had steak, ravioli and tiramisu for dessert. It was mamamia! So fresh and the taste itself is sooooo yummy! A bit pricey but that is fine for good food. Remember to book a table before you head to the restaurant, we got our table by luck."
Have the pasta!,The ambience and great pasta makes for a great dining spot with friends! Would definitely come back for another Italian night
From hero to zero :(,"This used to be one of our favourite Italian restaurants in the neighbourhood until today! Soggy bruschetta, not enough staff servicing the place and $3 for 2 tiny pieces of bread. (They used to have a mini loaf complimentary on the table previously so not sure what changed; perhaps the management?)
What a shame; Not sure I‚Äôll be coming back here again :(."
Excellent Service,"Service was good, waiter was attentive & patient. As it was our first time been to the restaurant, waiter provided recommendations with full descriptions from the food menu to us."
Not such a good start,"When I got there they could not find my booking. Their high tech solution of taking Chope bookings electronically and then writing everything in a giant book is clearly not effective. The table was wobbly, so that needed to be fixed. Our starters took quite a long time to come. The quality of the food was very good as always although perhaps the prices are a bit high for the portion size."
Good food but impolite service staff,"This is probably my 3rd time visiting Pasta Brava. This time round we were served by your waiter named Allan and I‚Äôd like to say that I am very annoyed by his service attitude. After finishing our dessert, he immediately walked over and shooed us off and demanded us to leave as the restaurant is getting crowded. He could have politely ask instead of demanding us to leave."
Not the Pasta Brava it use to be!!!,"Change of ownership/management. It was the worst experience ever!!! So disappointing! Prior to the current management, Pasta Brava was one of the top Italian restaurants in Singapore. Food, service and atmosphere never disappointed, but no more. Would not recommend this restaurant if you are an Italian food lover."
Very average Italian,"Very average mass made Italian food that no on in our party of 6 enjoyed.
Servings were small for the high prices (even for SG) especially the ravioli.
My cannelloni was more like a basic bolognese sauce with cheese.

Service was average too having to ask for more wine & water and things being removed from the table before being finished.

Prices need to be half to reflect the standards."
"Ok, but no more","Had a fine meal here, but not much out of the ordinary. The soup didnt taste as if it was homemade, but I may have been of course.
I had a the veggie risotto and it was actually ok which was good as there were not many veggie options."
Super nice Caneloni!,"The place is nice, good service and Pasta is amazing at reasonable price. We ordered beef carpaccio, pasta american souce and caneloni."
Just go for the pasta,"The pasta was great! Every pasta main we had at our table was good. Only drawbacks: poor wine selection, and dessert is not great. Just go for the pasta; it‚Äôs what they do best."
"Booked via website, only option available 5.00pm","Booked and received confirmation email followed by reminder 1 hour before we were due.
Needless to say when we arrived, havingkm cut short our afternoon activities, you can imagine our frustration to find the place didn't open until 6.15pm.
You need to sort out your booking system. It's not good enough and has ruined my wedding anniversary plans."
Our fav go to place! - Authentic Italian -,"Pasta brava is our family‚Äôs fav go to place for occasions or even date nites.
Been here more than the number of fingers and toes I have combined

Never a disappointment!
I always end up ordering the Same dish which is the scallops for appetisers and beef ravioli for my mains.
And I never get tired of it!!
So many good wine here so it‚Äôs really subjected to each one‚Äôs preference.

So much love for This place! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
Spoilt for choice!,"There's tons of pasta to choose from here, and if you're a seafood lover like me, definitely go for the seafood linguine. You will be craving for more"
Amazing pasta,"My top choice of place for pasta! Lovely ambience, great service and amazing food. Definitely a must try!"
"Unchanged menu, subpar service","Starter of baked aubergine tasted like it was reheated in a microwave, cod was fishy, ravioli and clam pasta were the heroes(thankfully).
Service was really subpar (sucks when your waiter tells you that they have a better bottle of wine when you are done with your meal :/)
Unlikely to visit again."
Good Pasta,There's a wide selection of pasta available here. Had dinner here with friends when I was back in town. Would recommend
Authentic Italian food,"Pasta Brava has always been my favourite italian restaurant. Ambience is good, service is good, and food is excellent. Not forgetting their tiramisu and lava cake! Must try!"
Indifferent,My review is based on the one dish that I ordered and one that my friend did. The first sign of problem was when my friend asked for a small customisation in the sauce and was informed that the sauces are pre - prepared. Then the food came rather fast reinforcing that. My linguine marre was over cooked. The amount of seafood for the price about 30 dollars was fine. But I think there are far better choices in Singapore for Italian. Their choice for sparkling water is limited - no Perrier or San Pellegrino. Service was indifferent and I cannot see any reason to return.
Great food but maybe better service?,"Our party had a wide range of antipasti and pasta and the food was absolutely incredible. Unfortunately, the kitchen might have been slightly let down by the front of house. When we were seated, we didn‚Äôt get any water or wine list. We tried to get the attention of the service staff and (unfortunately it happened more than once) our need for help was acknowledged but the minute the staff turned around, they forgot to come to our table to help with our request. We eventually had dedicated attention from a friendly service staff after we placed our orders. Unfortunately, we had severe wine spillage each time he refilled our glasses. So some slight tweeks to the service could really make this a really awesome experience."
Delicious Pasta and Soothing Ambience,"The service was fantastic, the pasta was outstanding, especially the squid ink pasta! For dessert, tiramisu is a must try!"
"Always reliable, excellent pasta","One of our GO-TO places in Singapore. Great pastas, good wine, fast service, decent prices. If you like good pasta look no further!!!"
Fab meal!!,Came here for my birthday and really enjoyed the meal. The food was outstanding and tasted amazing. They also bought me a candle with my dessert which was a nice touch. The waiter was very blunt and not very friendly that‚Äôs my only bad comment though
Outstanding Service and Food,"The service here truly impressed me. The waiters were extremely friendly and helpful, and even gave me recommendations on what the popular dishes were. The food itself exceeded my expectations, and the beef tenderloin and calamari were my personal favorites. Would recommend!"
Confusing service,"Heard positive reviews of Pasta Brava and wanted to give it a shot, only to be left with lots of question marks on the service.

Booked a Saturday dinner for 2 via Chope and stated that we will be using Burpple Beyond 1-for-1.

Arrived at the restaurant and was informed by the staff that we cannot book via Chope and use Burpple Beyond. Staff went on to say that they tried to contact me earlier to inform but could not reach me. I was honestly puzzled because the only call I received from them was the Chope bot to confirm my reservation.

We wanted a quick fix to the situation and suggested if we were treated as walk-ins now, could we then use Burpple Beyond. Staff said not possible as we can't use Burpple Beyond on weekends. 1st confusion here because this reason didn't gel with the previous one.

Staff being nice said she will check with her mgr for us. We were thankful for that. Mgr came and suggested: 1) dine in ala carte with no Burpple Beyond, 2) dine outdoors at the store beside and use Burpple Beyond, 3) dine after 9pm and use Burpple Beyond. I gazed at my watch, it was 6.15pm. The hungry me wouldn't be able to hang till 9pm for a meal. The walk to Pasta Brava already got us perspiring so dining outdoors will be a no go. Still confused by the options (cos Burrple Beyond never stated such exclusion days/hours, the only exclusions are eve of PH & PH), we went ahead with option 1 to dine in ala carte with no Burpple Beyond.

Food came and we dine with decent pastas in a not so crowded restaurant. Finished our meals and we stepped out of the restaurant, to see an almost empty store beside. I looked at my partner and we both were confused at why the mgr only offered the option to dine outdoors.

So yes, what an eventful saturdate! For the level of service and concern for their customers, probably my first and last visit with them."
Very Nice,this restaurant is yummy and the best Italian restaurant ill go invite some people to this restaurant the next time I go here I really like the lava cake and the pepperoni pizza
