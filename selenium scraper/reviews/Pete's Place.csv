Family dinner at Pete’s Place,"We use the Chope promotional voucher for 2 set dinner which is great value. In addition, my family of five ordered another 2 main entrées. The pizzas are really good and not expensive."
Family Dinner,"From the ambience, to the decor to the food and to the team that served us attentively (esp Emmanuel), this place feels authentic & traditional. Love the pizza fruiti DI mare, calamari, linguini Al granchio, linguini alla vongole & the panna cotta which was with the right creaminess (though a tad sweet).

Just a pity there was no Zuppa di mare which was my old time favourite. Hard to find an authentic place like this. Very similar to restaurants we last went in Sweden’s Gamla Stan. Good up the good job from service to the food!"
Disappointing experience,Great ambience but condescending and unprofessional service stuff with very average food. Overall not worth the price and will not go back
Always enjoyable at Pete’s Place,Basement restaurant vibe; excellent service; reasonably extensive menu; and tasty food. We always enjoy our visits to Pete’s place.
"authentic, cosy Italian",one of the best pizza places around with a rich history! been a while since we last visited many years ago but it’s still as good as we remember
Great set lunch,Had their 3 course set lunch - decent quality and good value for money. Had a procesco as well for $10 a glass - it was a decent sized glass and really chilled. Will go again.
Good food great ambiance,The staff were v polite and friendly We ordered the spinach ravioli and prosciutto pizza. Both were v good. Had the tiramisu for dessert and I must say it was one of the best I’ve ever had!
Old School Restaurant,"Nice cosy place. Good deal on restaurant week menu. 3 course meal, include appetiser, pasta, dessert + wine."
Always an Italian treat,"We eat a lot here. Minestrone soup is the only soup here since the beginning. Tagliatelle Bolognaise is always our favourite Italian ""bak chor mee pok"". It is juicy and tasty. Today we tried the special - Barramundi pan-fried and sits on a bed of seafood cooked with a tomato base. Our comfort food, always."
2nd visit to Pete's Place,"Enjoyed the food at Pete's place previously, immediately booked another visit to Pete's place when saw chope having deals for the restaurant. However, the 2nd visit was not as fantastic, perhaps of the dishes ordered. The seafood for cioppino was not v fresh and the parma ham also had a very strong smell and taste. Ravioli & Bruschetta also tasted average (but ciabatta was nice). Tiramisu was nice but some mouthful was overdose with coffee. Panna Cotta is da best!"
Great food but tiramisu is a little disappointing,"As usual, the pizza and pasta is amazing!! However, the tiramisu missed the mark a little. Would have been better if the tiramisu had a stronger coffee taste."
Lunch set,"We had 3 course set lunch. Calamari and caprese salad, linguine vongole, pizza diavola, tiramisu and panacotta all were good."
"Great food, service and place",Enjoyed the delicious 3 course set lunch. All the dishes were delicious and love the tiramisu. Nice cosy dining place suitable for gathering of friends and family!
Always a family favorite - from when the children were little,"Pete's place to the family is akin to going to grandma's for dinner... always warm and welcoming.
Pre COVID, we always loved Pete's selection of soup, bread, spread, salad and dessert... it was our first time back post COVD. We missed enjoying the wide selection, but the set meal didn't fail to impress and rekindle our craving to go back for more."
Nice and filling Italian food,"A good deal - chope birthday! We topped up to order the lobster pasta, as well as seafood pizza. Excellent food! We had a fulfilling lunch."
Delicious foods and superb services,"Very nice and authentic Italian cuisine! Serving staff are friendly, caring and attentive! Will be back"
Second time was soso,"Been here twice. The first time was great. Good food (note: the menu only serves the classics), warm service. The second time around, we were shunted off in a small corner, with a waiter who seemed just a little impatient. When it came to the end of the meal, it was hard to get attention to ask for the bill, and even when we finally did, it took forever to get my card back, and i had to go up to the counter. The food was still good, but the service was disappointing."
Great Pizza and Pasta,"for the starter we took bruschetta; tasted good however slightly messy when eating & minestrone soup was not really to my liking. Ordered the Lobster pasta. Had it previously and found it slightly on the salty side. Requested for it to be less salty this time and came out just nice for me. Also ordered the daily specials Pork with parama ham, did not quite like the taste and the pork slice was thin was kinda over cooked. Dessert we took TORTA AL CIOCCOLATO
Chocolate fondant, vanilla bean ice cream, berries - given strawberry ice cream instead of vanilla, loved the slight sour taste of the strawberrry. chocolate fondant tasted great esp with the ice cream."
The set lunches are a great deal,Very good place for simple Italian food done well. Especially their set lunches - a steal for the quality and quantity!
Excellent service,"Always enjoyed my dining at Petes place. Excellent food and servive, the lamb shank was so tender and well seasoned.I got a really good deal from chope!"
Not like the past,Disappointing experience. Used to be the preferred Italian establishment in the past. Food quality average at best. Pasta was not great while the pizza and appetizers were OK. Service below par for a Grand Hyatt establishment.
Absolutely wonderful service,"We usually come here whenever we're craving Italian but what makes it truly special is the service that the wait staff provides.

It happened to be my sister's birthday, and Sam, our waiter, somehow managed to catch that without any of us requesting for anything out of the ordinary. He surprised us with a birthday cake at the end of our meal, which made it so much more special for Sister, and even offered to pour out apple juice for my 9 year old in a wine glass so she got to participate in the toasting with all of us.

We were also lucky enough to get eagle-eyed Paul, who came back to us after we had paid the bill to inform us that he spotted a discrepancy (even though we had already checked it) and we had mistakenly paid for an item that we did not order. Wow anyone? I've never had a waiter check the bill for me after I've paid so I was suitably impressed. And my mum even more so since she was the one that paid for the meal.

The food as always was lovely, rich and hearty. Oh and I'd recommend their house pour! Apparently they brew it themselves, and the white wine in particular was extremely palatable.

Thanks Pete's Place for making the day special for us!"
"Average food, environment is dated","Ordered the 3-course set lunch.
One set with minestrone soup, barramundi fish, panna cotta dessert.
Another set with calamari, pizza with aged ham, tiramisu.
The soup portion is very small considering the price, it is like half a chinese bowl. The barramundi fish arrived cold, as they mixed up our order with another table. The panna cota is good but a bit too sweet.
The calamari is done very good, no oily smell taste. The pizza arrived cold due to mixed up order, the pizza was left at the serving table while waiting for the barramundi fish dish to be ready from the kitchen. The aged ham can be overpowering for some people. Tiramisu is ok, nothing to stand out."
New Year’s Eve dinner,"New Year’s Eve dinner was sharing platters. Food overall was tasty & nice except for few mentions:-
Quite a few clams didn’t open & an attentive chef should NEVER have served them
For 6 guests, only 2 lobsters (4 halves) was given. So the parents didn’t have any.
Service was very attentive & top ups on champagne was above par. Change of plates was done on multiple occasions. We had extra oysters which were very fresh."
Poor experience,"Had a reservation at 6.15pm for a birthday celebration & was told that we had to clear our table by 7.30pm. However, despite having been ready to order in 5 minutes, but the servers were incredibly inattentive (this felt almost intentional), making it really difficult to get our order taken. Appetisers came quickly and were subpar. The ciabatta was the only thing that was commendable. When we wanted to get condiments or add on orders, it was again very difficult to do so. We waited for an hour for our mains. By 7.30pm, we had asked for the status of the food thrice, and never once received an update until we caught the attention of another service staff and expressed our frustations. The mains were still slow to arrive and incredibly disappointing. We ordered the pizza quattro formaggi (way too salty and poorly presented), seasonal lamb stew (lamb was ridiculously tough, flavourless and did not taste fresh, and vegetables were undercooked. There was barely any sauce), risotto (flavourless) & gnocchi (gnocchi texture was great, sauce was flavourless).

Provided feedback to the staff but no mitigating measures were made.

This place used to be my mum's favourite Italian restaurant, so it was a very disappointing experience for the whole family especially since it was an event. Hope that there will be better-trained staff to provide a more efficient & pleasant dining experience for guests in the future. They should also relook and taste their menu."
Lovely lunch,"Great Italian restaurant within the Hyatt hotel. Great value set lunch with good choice, all the food was lovely and great service. Never knew it existed until now but will definitely be back!"
Beautiful Vintage Decor,"Finally able to dine in as it is pretty difficult to reserve a table during the weekend even though it was quite empty when we arrived. A flight of steps downstairs leads to the restaurant. As we entered, the decor, brick designed walls with wooden pieces of furniture won our hearts. It presented a warm and cozy feeling. Plus the open kitchen is visible as you are shown to your table.

Once seated for choose to go with the three-course menu and separately ordered for .

The Starters:
1. BRUSCHETTA AL POMODORO: The Toasted ciabatta bread was nice, loved the sour taste it bought out along with the toppings.

2. CAPRESE: The basil pesto went well with the buffalo mozzarella.

The Main Course:
1. RAVIOLI DI RICOTTA AGLI SPINACI: It might have tasted better if it was not submerged in tomato gravy.

2. VERDURA: Was quite bland for my taste. Needs improvement.

Desserts: (Literally the best part)
1. TORTA AL CIOCCOLATO: The chocolate fondant was delicious and went well with vanilla bean ice cream.

2. TIRAMISU: It was good but have tasted better.

Overall the food is average but the place is worth the visit because of the decor."
Good but.,"Food was not bad, except 3/4 of the attendees had a mild stomach ache after the meal (prob from carbonara)."
Food was great but slow,The food was so good but the waiting time from one dish to another dish very long time. Not sure because too many people or supposed to be like that
Great food and service!,Nice hideout and lovely ambience. Very timeless place and great for catch up. The 3 course lunch is actually pretty heavy!
Good Old Friends Gathering,"Another delightful experience with good food and great service at Pete's Place. Our attentive service staff offered great food selection that pleased everyone's palate. It made our gathering more memorable and we look forward to our next gathering there. However, one improvement that can be made is the decor. The place seemed dated and tired. It needs to be refreshed."
Lunch with an ex-colleague,"My friend & I often meet yearend to catch up & it’s already 3 yrs. in a row, we often end up in Pete’s Place. Food standard continue to be v. good so is the ambience. 1st time using Chope promo w/3-course set vs buffet, that was v. good too & Rest. Mgr. handled the redemption w/o any fuss or misinterpretation/confusion, so all was done very quickly & we both had a wonderful lunch experience. Thank U."
"Excellent food, excellent service","To be honest, I have forgotten all about Pete's Place. It's been a >10 years since I visit Pete's Place. And I never quite fancy going into their basement. Thanks to Chope, I got their birthday vouchers for set lunch. And I can say this: It was very very good. We had seafood vongole and their lasagna as mains. Even at regular pricing, it's good value. The service personnel are all very polite and professional. I would return to Pete's Place again for lunch."
No more buffet lunch :-(,"It's set lunch at a reasonable price. Salads while refillable is only organic which isn't my favorite. There's no choice . Wish they offer non organic salads like in the past.
There isn't a selection of choices ,like in the previous buffet, of meats, pastas and dessert. Instead it's either pasta or pizza only unless you order the dish of the day which incidentally is very good.
Understand it's covid situation, and want to support the restaurant too, but compared to the previous buffet, the set lunch is not comparable in terms of quantity. At least could have provided coffee or tea to make up for it.

A long time and still fan of Pete's Place."
Great lunch experience,"Went with 2 young kids, mil and husband. The portion sizes of the set lunch was more than enough for us. They gave us a large table and baby chair. It was well segregated for safe distance measures. We bought chope vouchers with a discount during 11.11 period. Will definitely return even without vouchers."
Hearty Italian Cuisine & Impeccable Service,"We were looking forward to dine at Pete’s Place again since it re-opened its doors in October. To our delight, Pete’s Place has retained its warm & inviting charm. Celebrated my husband’s 60th birthday this evening, in a cosy & familiar setting, with wonderful food and company, just the way we like it. As always, the food & beverage are fresh, meticulously prepared & served. The good service delivered by the attentive staff, led by Shan the friendly manager, is always pleasing. We will be back again soon."
Feedback on food and staff,Food - good but nothing to shout about expect the Panna cotta Staff - can smile a bit more and be cheerful. Looking forward to service with a smile.
Standard as good as it's always been. Excellent!,So nice to visit the place again after so many years and still be completely satisfied with then quality of food and service. Great job to the entire team!
Good culinary experience,"I am glad Pete’s place rustic ambience is the same after its reopening. The culinary experience is good. Despite the shortage of staff, Shan and his team was efficient and friendly."
"Good Pizza, Friendly staff",This was our first visit to Pete’s and we absolutely loved their veg pizza n desserts. I take this opportunity to mention Mr Shan & Uncle Mike who made extra effort to welcome our child to this eatery. Good staff n good food are best ambassadors in this business. Our son would love to visit again ! Many thanks !
Set lunch at Pete’s Place,"Make reservations b4 u go, full house even on weekdays. Good Service even staffs busy at all time due lack of man power. Food are excellent, unlimited organic salad if you choose it as appetizer. Set lunch doesn’t include drink, but plain water is on the house. If it’s on your birthday, you might have a complementary slide of cake with candle on it, it would be wonderful if they could sing the birthday song with us, but could be restricted by regulation. Will go back again for sure with reservations made."
Lunch at Pete's Place,"My wife & I have been coming to Pete's Place since the late 80's and we are never disappointed with the food and the service. We recently dined here twice in the last 2 weeks for my wife's birthday & our anniversary. It has just reopened after closing at the start of the covid-19 pandemic. The service has not changed, still very good & the food excellent. Lunch was a set menu of either 3 or 2 courses. It's $35 for a 3 course set lunch with lots of choices for starter, main & desert. If you prefer to go for just 2 courses, it's $30.
We also ordered a Prosciutto di Parma pizza the 1st week we were there. It was one of the best pizza we have had, brimming with Parma ham & cheese on a crusty base. Trouble is that, it's just too much food to add to the very substantial set lunch!
We will definitely be back soon, probably with friends so that we can try more offerings from the menu!"
Good Italian food,Delicious caprese salad with heirloom tomatoes. Fresh seafood on pizza. Al Funghi risotto was al dente and tasty. Tiramisu was on point too!
Great food and service,The food was great and the service was superb. I like the deco of the restaurants back to the olden times when I was a kid. Will be back for more.
Better not for dinner,"They do not have buffet for dinner. I ordered the seafood pasta of the day which has half a lobster. Came out like local hokkien mee. Wife ordered angus steak. Think better at Aston. House wine and Tirasu was so so. For $146, can do much better elsewhere."
Good time,Great place to dine and catch up with friends. We had salad & soup buffet which was fresh n excellent. The staff were friendly and efficient. Always enjoy the place !
Reservation was not in the list,"Made a reservation the night before the lunch. However, the reservation was not included in the reserved list in Pete's Place."
Detox after all the festive eating,Great time to catch up with old friends but the Pete’s Place salad bar offers a satisfying lunch with no guilt amidst Good & Friendly service !
Good Selection,"It's small and cozy. Small Selection, but very good. food is fresh! Pizza on the spot and especially enjoyed the small oysters!"
No paper bag for takeaway,Ordered a takeaway pizza and was informed by staff that they do not have paper bag for me to carry the pizza home. Wondering how will anyone be able to carry all the food if we were to order more to takeaway? The pizza was good but I will definitely have second thoughts to order takeaways from here.
Pizzas were a little to crisp.,"We dined twice in Pete's Place, wasn't the best place. However, they had a special, a free buffet salad and bread. Second visit found the salad bar a little depleted."
Great Service,Excellent service staff in Mr Sam. Always made me feel welcome. The food is ok but what makes the difference is the friendliness of the staff. Thanks much.
Yet another delectable lunch :-),"Straight up the salad bar is my favorite . That with the breads would have been enough for a healthy lunch but but the desserts while limited in range is always an inevitable finish. Recently they have added mini ice cream tubs . Not a fan of that not because it's no good but have to watch the sugar intake. Would have been better if they replaced that with free cup of beverage like in the past.
The meats for the full buffet (they do have a vegetarian option) and the pastas are decent. It is a buffet after all.
And of course the pleasant service of the staff is always an additional pleasure dining there. Kudos to Sam senior ."
Nice Italian,"Located in basement of the Singapore Grand Hyatt to left of main entrance. Italian cafe style decor with a Saturday lunchtime brunch set up. Very good value brunch packages available. As well as standard pasta and pizza stations, the seafood and meat selection are actually very good. Good value Saturday lunch"
Always Good,"I come with my family quite often for the buffet lunch and the food is always fresh and good. I love that they have vegan options and lower price for half-board, which is fantastic for that friend who has special dietary needs"
Sumptuous dinner & Excellent Service!,"Sumptuous dinner and Excellent customer service! Very good ambiance. Shout out to Ms. Veronica, manager on duty! Great team!"
italian overload!,The ambiance of the place are simply amazing hidden underground at grand hyatt. The food was was delicious and the service are trully exceptional. If you are looking for traditional italian food one of the best in Singapore!
Great hidden gem.,Was taken here by a friend for Sunday lunchtime and cold beer. Down stairs in the cool out of the heat this is a great place for business lunch or just catch up with friends. They also have good drink deals well worth the money.
Quality food,"It has nice ambience and most of all, good food. My family loves the pastas, pizza and myself, i love the salad bar."
Never Fails to Disappoint Us!,"Have been coming here for 30+ years and the food is consistently good. This season, they have a special promotion of S$69++ for 3-course dinner of your choice! For starters, we had the mixed cured meats (Affettati Misti) and the Baked eggplants with Parmesan (Melanzane alla Parmigiana. For the mains, Spaghetti Cioppino (with half Maine lobster, scallops, prawns, clams, squids, crab meat!) and Black Angus beef fillet (180g) with roasted wild mushrooms & polenta (Filetto di Manzo al Funghi). Finished beautifully with their signature Tiramisu and Vanilla Panna Cotta. Don’t miss this special deal! Only negative is you have to wait some time for the service - they seem to be short of staff."
Birthday's Celebration,"I was thoroughly impressed with the food, service and ambience. Food was amazing, service was impeccable and ambience was relaxed and warm. Keep it up!"
"Great Food , Nice Atmosphere , Good service","I have had quite a few on the menu items over the last year or and never been disappointed , always please with the wine too. Really good spot at reasonable prices."
Impeccable dinning experience here,"My friends and I had a wonderful meal here. The lasagna, pasta and pizzas are cooked to perfection. Easily one of the best Italian restaurant in town. We received a personalised service from one of the waiter, Sam Wan. He was very attentive and friendly to us. My compliments to your restaurant."
Plant-based lunch buffet,"Found the food delicious, especially the pasta, I had the tomato and pesto spaghett which was al dente and as fragrant with herbs as those I had in Italy many times on holiday. The soups were good too, the corn soup better than the minestrone. A limited salad selection which I didn't mind at all and I could have my favorite beetroot, red cabbage and sweet potato. Found the pizza unspectacular, though, but the battered cauliflower was fine and the portobello mock meat very tasty, smelling charred like real meat,possibly the best item in the vegan spread.
Of the good variety of breads and vegan spreads, I only had room for the crisp bread sticks which seemed very popular with the lunch crowd. The mud cake and the slice of apricot tart, I think, were quite unusual and delicious..
Service was friendly and water refilled constantly, plates cleared quickly but no one came to ask if we wanted coffee or tea and when I enquired of the waitress, she said it wasn't included in the buffet. Subsequently read in the reviews that you could expect a round of coffee or tea! Now, which is it? Would be gratified to know."
Terrible,"Walking past my husband decided to dine here, poor service didn't receive drink sloppy risotto overcook calamari don't bother."
Sunday Bruch,"We took out our nephew for lunch with our own kids and really enjoyed the Sunday Bruch. They have Amazing breads and soups, salads, the main course was very inclusive for vegetarians . We skip most buffets because we are usually searching for things to eat as vegetarians. I would give them Five stars for being so inclusive for vegetarians. The truffle risotto on that day excellent, so was the ricotta spinach cannelloni. The sticky date pudding in the dessert section was simply outstanding and the other deserts were outstanding too. I would highly recommend going there. The bruch costed us 257 SGD with one meal for a child. We felt stuffed and happy after lunch."
Disappointing Saturday buffet,"Used to be very good antipasti but now is totally Junk. Salad bar, Doesn’t have tomatoes. Ham, just standard ham. No salami or other choices. Even salad bar, has no ruccola. Cheese, is like packet parmesan. Can’t find parmigiana regano. Pizza for non meat (part of buffet for non meat) was not available Most of the time. I think this is certainly not a restaurant that you will find In Hyatt and it is a disgrace to an Italian food."
Gluten Free Pizza,Good service. Indian waiter asking if I was celiac and indicated it would take longer. Accurately updating me when it was a few minutes out. Pretty good base albeit obviously gluten free. Not the best one in Singapore but pretty good.
What a wonderful monday lunch!,"Must have been a monday lunch crowd or lack of it. The service was better than normal which was already good. Had time to chat with friendly unhurried staff.
The salad and bread bar was good as usual. The cooked food items were tantalizing salmon, beef and chicken. All good. And special mention goes to the vongole pasta. Had 2 plates of delicious clam pasta !
The desserts were all yummy too.
Shout out to Sam, Paul and Sam Junior for their friendly service!"
Excellent food and great place for the family,"Pete’s Place is an excellent place for dinner and family gatherings. We had an enjoyable time and the service provided was awesome! Compliments to Sam, Yunos and Zack for the excellent service."
Substandard pizza,"Been to Pete s place many times . Tonight I ordered a Hawaiian pizza , and it was by far the worse pizza I have ever eaten .

Firstly , it took 30 mins to come after I had finished my spaghetti. Secondly , when the pizza came , it was warm at best . Very soggy and Not crispy at all . Tasted very bad actually . Btw, heard that many customers complained too.

On a lighter note , thankfully , the very friendly and every helpful staff , Zack, was there. He was as usual , doing his best . I appreciate his service .

Noticed that the food standard has been going downhill of late . This restaurant better buck up or no one will go there again .

Exceptional Italian,Had 2 pastas and a pizza all of which were extraordinarily good for an Italian in Asia but Singapore is definitely an exception to this. Excellent service by staff and tiramisu at the end was spot on. Quality of wine by the glass was also very good.
Great place!,"I’ve been coming here for years and I enjoy myself each time. Located in the basement of Grand Hyatt, its secretive charm makes it even more cosy. It’s something about the dark setting, bistro style table cloths and warm hospitality that I just know I’m going to have a good time the moment I walk through the doors.

I always go for Pasta as I’m a sucker for pasta ‍♀️ what I like is that they do have a salad bar as well which serves pretty decent stuff and the bread bar is complimentary with any order. My favorite spreads are the garlic pesto and ripen tomatoes!

I feel it’s worth it if you go for the Set Menu that comes with any starter, any main and any dessert. As I usually go for the Spaghetti Cioppino that comes with half main lobster ($44) the set is worth it! It’s divine by the way.

Would definitely recommend anyone who wants a good Italian meal in town."
Nice Italian cuisine,"Go to the basement at the Grand Hyatt and you will reach this restaurant in a pure Italian tavern style, a cosy place.
The service is good, smiling and efficient. Good selection of Italian delicacies, pizzas, pasta, fish, meat, good selection of cheese and nice sweets too.
Interesting wines list, not much choice by the class though.
Decent pricing 40 to $50 per head for a good meal."
Very average food,"We ordered some vegetarian risotto which was ok. We also ordered a bruschetta, which is simply baked bread with sliced tomato pieces. No salt, no sun dried tomatoes, no fresh herbs, and no taste. Which restaurant calls itself Italian but can't make a basic bruschetta? Not visiting again."
"3.5 stars - good breads/salads selection, good service but could be more refined","Tried the lunch buffet on Friday.
Love the ambience - very traditional Italian style decor, very warm and cosy. The restaurant was about slightly more than half full yet the place wasn't very noisy, so I was able to have a good conversation with my lunch company.
Two soups to choose from - pumpkin and vegetable. I tried the pumpkin soup .. it tasted diluted but still alright.
I like the breads selection - probably nearly ten types of breads. Some of the breads are really limited so it would not be replenished. As such, might be best to get your breads first thing you scour the buffet spread. The bread quality is good (not fantastic, though) and there are 4 flavoured butters to choose from. Nice.
There is a pizza corner. Only two types of pizzas are made. You might want to wait for a fresh pizza. I tried a slice that was already displayed and it didn't taste nice - very little cheese, in fact, very little everything.
The salad selection looked adequate but I didn't try it, except for the sundried tomatoes.
There is a small mains selection - grilled chicken (nicely grilled), meatloaf (not very tasty), steamed fish (dry, bland) and two plant-based dishes (not that nice). Fortunately, the mains costs an additional SGD$7++ so that's not too bad. But for second timers, I think you can give the mains a pass.
The fruits and sweets selection is small but quite alright still.
Carparking at the hotel is around SGD$8 for 2 hours. Do check with the restaurant if you can get complimentary carpark redemption coupons.
The service staff are very attentive. However, I feel their service could be more refined. Most of the time, the waiters just take away the empty plates without checking with you.
I wouldn't mind coming back here, perhaps just to have the buffet salads/soups."
Good Italian Restaurant,A mid-priced Italian restaurant with good Italian food. The bread station is great with the vairety of butter. House Red wine is also surprisingly good. Good place for a good Italian meal.
Good pizza place for meeting pals,"This is an expensive pizza parlour, but one of the restaurants in the Hyatt Singapore so to be expected... service ok food ok wouldn't necessarily recommend it if you're not staying in the hotel but it is fine for a group of pals... So many other places in Singapore that no need to eat here!"
Good food and service,"We had the Sunday Brunch. While the buffet spread isn't as wide as hotel's international buffets, the food here are of pretty good quality. This is the 2nd time we visited the restaurant and i must say the restaurant is pretty cozy, the service is consistent as the staff are quite attentive in serving us, whether it is refilling our water or clearing plates. The tiramisu is really good, so do try it if you are here."
Marked improvement!,"As I am a CATH card holder, my family and I frequent Pete's Place cos their buffet on weekends are fairly reasonable after the discount!

We have been there 3 times prior to our most recent visit which was a pleasant surprise! The food quality and variety were markedly better! The staff did then tell me that the Chef and all the other staff were replaced recently.

I must send my compliments to the Chef and his team ... it makes our visit even more worthwhile now since the quality/variety have improved!

Please keep the cost of the buffet on weekends the same!"
Good value for Singapore,"The staff were really nice and the food was quite good. Not too pricey. We have eaten in a few other places on this trip, none of which were in such nice surroundings and not as good value either. Great atmosphere. Definitely worth a visit"
Insipid food,We were a little disappointed with the food. The mushroom risotto had absolutely no salt . Lamb chops lacked flavour and seasoning. Pan fried fish too was too bland for our palate. The pizzas were okayish. Service was good though.
Great dining experience,"Prompt and good service, delicious food, awesome salad and bread bar and lovely ambience! We had a wonderful evening at Pete’s Place."
good food n service,"the entrance is at the side of the grand Hyatt lobby. there is a staircase leading down. staff are friendly.
the seafood pasta n lamb were very good. sirloin steak above average. pizza loaded with seafood n certainly tasty.
complimentary car park for those driving."
Italian Restaurant with a nice Salad Bar,"There are Italian restaurants on every street but I like going to Pete's place when I am hungry! For every main meal there is a ""free"" trip to the salad bar. But the salad bar is excellent (and healthy) and if you are not careful you wont have room for your main course.
Teh restaurant is in the basement at Hyatt and is red brick Italian rustic. It's not brightly lit and the staff are not overbearing. Lastly, its great for kids. They can dabble at the salad bar even !
Overall, one of our stock standard favourites. The food is excellent too (although I would expect at this price point)."
Excellent Food & Ambience,My friends and I love to have our lunch gathering at Pete's place and the food and service never disappoint us.
Prompt and friendly staff,"Preferred table reserved as requested. Free a portion of self-select fresh salad and free flow of bread spread when a main course is ordered before 7pm, that’s generous and thoughtful."
Wonderful Birthday Dinner!,"It was my first time there for a birthday dinner, and the experience was awesome! We ordered a pizza & pasta to share. Huge portions & great services. Will definitely go back again!"
Excellent underground Italian eatery,"I used to come here many years ago when I was still a young lady. Now decades later as a grandma, I re-visited Pete's place and still love its rustic ambiance which feels like a secret underground neighborhood-type Italian restaurant you find in NYC. This place is always relevant and very good value."
Lunch buffet,"They have buffet without main course which is the better option because I find their main course don’t taste like good Italian food. This place is more a salad bar with soup, salad and dessert. They don’t cook authentic Italian food...more like the Chinese version of Italian food. However, they provide a sufficient array of salad and desserts. Also include pizza in this buffet without main course."
Average food but great service,"I wasn’t overwhelmed with the taste, neither was I underwhelmed.. I was just whelmed.. :)
Food is average, nothing to swoon over, but service was very good. Considering how bad service can get at top notch places in Singapore, if you’re a stickler for getting good service, then this place is definitely worth coming back for."
The good alternative restaurant!,"When you need a fine taste European food restaurant, this is the place.
Italian food, good !
Not so spicy like most of the Asian food.
Good service. Fine variety of food. Good bar. All good. In the fine HYATT REGENCY hotel a real good alternative for good and tasty food."
All Time Greats,"Pete's Place is one of the all time greats for italian food in Singapore. High quality food, served in hearty portions, in a classic italian atmosphere. One of the few places where the staff serve for decades, and the food tastes beautiful no matter the occasion. Book an early dinner slot and get one trip to the Salad Bar free."
Parents 52nd Wedding Anniversary,"Great Service !
Kudos to Eunos & the crew, made it extra special when the cake came out as a surprise.
Food was TOP notch, especially the beef, was cooked to perfection as how my small one loved ♥️ it. she insisted I take a photo of her first cut into the beef, as seen in the pics
Thank you once again for that special night to remember"
Great first time experience!,It was my business guest first visit to Pete’s Place & he was impressed by the great service. He said the buffet lunch spread was not big but adequate. We enjoyed ourselves!
Great Food Mediocre Service,"Was excited and booked Pete's Place for advance Valentine's Day celebration and our 4th Wedding Anniversary. Great food but a little let down by service for overlooking my rsvp request. Table wasn't ready when we arrived, Valentine's menu wasn't available although booking was confirmed. When asked the senior server if they're aware of my request, the reply was 'oh my reservation team forget'. I do appreciate the cake with candle but will be nice touch to include some writing on the plate. It our special ocassion but it doesn't feel like one. Perhaps management should look into basic training if they want repeat business."
Heidi's Bday Dinner 16.02.19,"Thank you for the kind hospitality as well as the warm and friendly service on that night

Food was good and allocation was perfect to get some privacy and fun chat etc

You guys are a star!"
Hearty Italian food,"My Husband and I had a hearty dinner at Pete’s Place. As we ordered before 7pm, the salad bar came free. I loved the salad and bread, especially the sun dried tomato butter for the bread.

We shared the lobster pasta and pan fried fish and the pasta was really good. We also ordered the tiramisu which was very yummy, not too sweet. We will definitely go back there again. Service was good except that the staff missed out our tiramisu order and we had to remind her after waiting for more than 10 mins. So I suggest that they write down the order during peak timing."
Oh god I'm so full !,"Had a full lunch at Pete's . Ample salads and main courses . Desserts too was delicious. Too much for lunch :-).
Pasta was however disappointing. Maybe it's CNY.
Not a single pasta was good . Quite unlike their ala carte pastas. As a regular though, this is the first time it happened. Normally it's pretty decent. Perhaps they should revert back to cooking the pastas in a tray where diners can help themselves. Better for the chefs as well as less wastage.
Absent is the coffee/tea with the buffet :-(. It's not included like previously. Last time there was even a cookie with the beverage :-).
Still good though :-)"
Lunch at Pete's Place,"I was recently re-acquainted with Pete's Place. Food there is still pretty good, wholesome and satisfying. Range of desserts have somewhat decreased but the salad selections remains awesome - my favourite being the pan-fried absolutely delicious mushrooms. Prices have crept upwards but still represent good value for money. Prices are slightly cheaper for the salad/soups/dessert buffet but the full buffet includes meat/fish mains, pastas etc looks like a ""better"" deal. Eat at your own risk because you simply cannot stop. Like an old friend, it was warm and inviting; and did I mention already, service was great and welcoming. We will definitely visit again soon - it is always good to meet up with old friends."
