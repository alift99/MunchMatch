Very very rude service who shouted profanity at customers,"The Front Of House at Wooloomooloo Singapore shouted profanity at us!

Our family of 3 arrived promptly at 7pm, and was greeted by an Indian front-of-house manager, who made us wait for 5 minutes whilst, allegedly, trying to find us a seat.

He reappeared only to tell us that we could only be seated at 7:30pm, our booking time. I proceeded to show him my reservation on my mobile phone (below email refers) and, unprovoked, he exchanged profanities with my son. He instigated the exchange by beginning the conversation with “why are you so angry?” (I wasn’t and did NOT raise my voice at any point in time.

We walked away and please do not eat at Wooloomooloo …"
Excellent Wagyu Tomahawk,The wagyu tomahawk was excellently done and was succulent. Expect to wait a bit as the chef prepared it but well worth it. Lobster bisque soup was another great choice we made. Pleasant and attentive staff.
Made our anniversary dinner amazing,Extremely pleasant experience and was served by an amazing manager namely Jenny! She literally made our anniversary a hundred times better. Tonight’s dinner experience was one to never forget because of her. We will definitely return for steaks and of course for Jenny’s wonderful service.
Steakhouse,"Good ambience, and good customer service. Steak was above average. Their bread served in the beginning was good but not the nicer one I have tried in other places."
Very disappointing dinner experience for husband's milestone birthday celebration,"I had dinner here with my husband on 28 December 2022.

Firstly, this dinner was meant to celebrate my husband's 35th birthday (his actual birthday!) which we consider to be a milestone. Having dined at the restaurant before (twice, in fact) and experiencing high standards of food and service, I decided to choose this restaurant to ensure a quality celebration for him. Next, I made my reservations one month ahead of 28 December, and made a request to have a table along the window panels. The reservation team acknowledged my email on 29 November, and informed me that they would do their best to accede to my request. Now, let me share all the things that have gone wrong during this dinner experience.

We arrived at the restaurant on 28 December at 7.30pm. There was already a queue at the entrance, and 3 people were ahead of us. No staff was in sight, and we had to stand and wait for 10 minutes before a staff attended to us and brought us to our table. This is unusual. At reputable steak restaurants such as Cut by Wolfgang Puck and Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse, just to name a few, there is always a staff at the entrance of the restaurant to welcome and greet the restaurant.

Next, I noticed that most of the tables along the window panels were all occupied. When I asked the staff if we were going to be seated next to the window panels, she told me that all the tables were occupied! I noted an empty table near the window panel and when I requested to sit there, I was told that it was not possible. This is so disappointing especially when I made my reservation and request one month ahead! It really felt like the restaurant did not pay much attention to seating the guests, and merely just filled up the tables accordingly to the arrival of the guests. We ended up at a table right in front of the kitchen, which was not very desirable.

Next, once we were seated, we noticed that our table was very shaky. Just placing our hands on the table was enough to shake it. Again, this is something that we have not experienced in a restaurant that is in a 5-star hotel. We had to call for a waiter to help us and eventually this problem was resolved with some paper placed under the base. I was already very upset at this point in time.

Let's now move on to the food and drinks. I ordered the USDA Prime Rib Eye steak while my husband ordered the Australian Wagyu Sirloin. We also ordered 2 glasses of red wine. We were shocked when we saw that our wines were served in pretty small glasses. Again, this was very different from previous dinner experiences when the wines were served in bigger glasses. Our food also took longer than expected to be served. Once our food came, I stood up to take pictures. However, I had to wait for some time before I could call on an available staff to help me take pictures. In other restaurants that we've been to, if a staff notices guests preparing to take photographs, he/she would offer to take pictures. Hence, it was disappointing that I had to stand and wait for some time before calling an available staff to do so. We then started to eat our steaks. The USDA Prime Rib Eye steak was very tender and delicious upon the first few bites. However, after about 10 minutes, the steak became very dry and it was difficult to eat. On the other hand, my husband's Australian Wagyu Sirloin remained tender and juicy, and he had to switch steaks with me in order for me to continue eating. At this point in time, I was really very upset that what should have been a great, memorable dinner experience for my husband was turning out to be just so wrong, that I had to refrain from crying and had to visit the washroom to calm down.

When I went to the washroom, the manager came over to my husband and asked how everything was. My husband then shared that I was very upset about the whole dinner experience. He then promised to make up for it. When I returned from the washroom, the manager came over to apologise and offered us 2 complimentary cocktails from the alcohol menu, which he said he would personally make. We appreciated his kind gesture, which helped to end this night in grace.

All in all, I must say that this has been a very disappointing and upsetting dinner experience at Wooloomooloo. I had thought that an established restaurant like Wooloomooloo would be a perfect and safe choice to celebrate a special occasion with my husband. However, so many things had gone wrong. For the prices of the menu items, it was really not worth it. Such poor service systems and processes are unacceptable at a steakhouse restaurant in a 5-star hotel. I hope that my feedback can be taken into account seriously, and that compensation is given to us for this upsetting and disappointing dinner experience."
Excellent wine pairing,Been to their wine pairing dinner couple of times. I m always impressed with the fantastic food ( special thanks to the Chef) plus the meticulously chosen paired wines. My friends and I are always well taken care of by their team of well trained staffs.
Birthday Lunch,"My wife booked this as an alternative to places we usually frequent. The place looks good, it has a decent menu. The food is okay. It's nothing to write home about. What really lets it down is the service. A long wait from ordering our initial drinks, as well as in between courses. A mix up between my order and my sons order didn't help. In all I got the impression from them, that it was all just a bit too much of an inconvenience that we were in there trying to order food and spend money. I won't be back"
Tasty and Yummy Meat,Had a wonderful family lunch and was delighted with the portion of freshly and well cooked meat. The service was warm and attentive.
Visit on weekday lunch,Lunch set was value for money. Restaurant had Good ambience. Service staff was attentive. Would definitely go back if i had the chance! Perhaps for dinner.
Always delicious food,"I've visited this restaurant about four times and every time there was always a good thing for me. This time,I met my friend couple for the first time in almost 10 years and had a good time."
"Excellent steak, superb value-for-money","Tried their set lunch for the first time last Thursday and was very impressed, not just with the food (which is of superb value for money and some might even argue it's underpriced!), but also with the service staff - Manager Felix, Jun, Lynette, Youhai & Faith. Hospitality is top-notch. Thank you, guys!"
"Food normal, nothing spectacular They can't do well done steaks here.","Not sure how they got their rave reviews.

$12 for still water - u can probably buy 4 bottles at the supermarket downstairs for the same price

No one asked if we wanted 2nd helpings of bread.

Soup came in a tiny bowl and no one came to ask if we wanted pepper?

Ordered steak well done and it was bloody inside. Sent it back and it came back charred.

Coffee in a tiny cup for $9. The person who came with the bill was unsmiling and kinda rude.

Glad I came to try coz never again.

U can get better service and food for cheaper elsewhere. We had crab cake, 2 soups, 2 mains, fries (sides are charged separately), coffee & tea - almost $300.
I would not have mind paying if the food and service was good but in our case, it was sadly lacking."
Disappointing Service.,"Meal was acceptable for the price, although I think foisting 4 courses for lunch on me (no 3 course option) was not a plus. After delightful monkfish; the soup arrived for my companions, who were ready. But I wasnt. The Asst Manager (male)took the soupbowl from the Junior waiter and dumped it in front of me and walked away although i was plainly only halfway thru my starter. I gathered that they must be rushing the lunch so I even finished my soup quickly. Then a 20min wait happened for main course ! Many other diners finished and left. At the end of the meal, i caught the same Asst Manager’s eye to bring me the bill, and he acknowledged. He then sauntered over to another table to laugh and joke with the customers. We waited a good 10 minutes for the bill while he was chit chatting away.
By theway the Cajun chicken was dry and stringy. But my wagyu beef pasta and the rib eye (another $25) was delicious. However, even tho you pay $25 more, they do not offer you 4 types of sauce. You have to ask for it. The sesame tuille accompanying the Lemon Tart is delicious! Saved the day.
Thank you tho for the birthday dessert - a half slice of Almond tart. The other half went to the Birtthday Girl at the table next to us ! After rave reviews about their excellent service, this was a letdown. I was quite embarrassed in front of my guests."
Ms Viv,"Dood was great - Ordered the scallop and crab cake as starter. Lobsters soups. USDA Rib-Eyes as main.
Service can be better, I have to keep asking for menu for food & drinks.. as if we're not there..
Not sure is it because we dress in t-shirt and jeans?"
Perfect lunch,Full restaurant which has great atmosphere. Business lunch menu which was great - excellent cauliflower soup course.
Wonderful experience,"Staffs are so considerate and attentive. I requested for window seats and they arranged it for me with additional chair to put my shopping items (without me requesting). Ambience was awesome, view was great. Food is pretty good too. Overall, really satisfied."
Very expensive,"Steak was excellent but was surprised at our $400 bill, with the cheapest wine. Just be careful and know what you’re doing."
Very Noisy,No Wellington Beef which was the purpose of the visit and there was so much noice that we hardly could talk together
Dinner for 2,We had dinner for 2 at the Steakhouse. The food and beverages were good. The atmosphere for 2 people was disappointing as we were seated right next to a service station with people continually standing and working right over the edge of the table and right next to my wife. That type of seating is not expected in the quality of steakhouse we were expecting.
"Great food, value for money set lunch","We came to celebrate my hubby’s birthday. Their set lunch was of great value. We top up some for the steak. Portion was good. Taste was excellent. We were given a specially decorated birthday plate for the dessert. Fantastic services from their staff too, they are very attentive and helpful. We will definitely return for another visit"
Great ambience and staff but disappointed with the food,"Great place, spacious and the staff were friendly. Rather noisy on that day. The food was disappointing- the wagyu (tomahawk）did not melt in the mouth. The crab cake was not worth the price. The Foie Gras was amazing!"
Meh!,"1) Had the prix-fixe menu. While everything else was awesome, ironically the steak itself was ordinary.

2) Music should be more chill and subdued (NOT Top 40s), given the look and ambience of the place.

3) Tho the staff eventually apologized, damage was done. For 4/5 of the dinner, they were too busy with everyone else’s needs/orders/bills…except ours. They eventually took off $30 from the bill but then the knee-jerk reaction is, “Damn right they better had!”"
Awesome service from Shahjahan and his team!,"There were four of us, having a farewell lunch for a good couple, who were going to move to South Asia for his CEO role in a major airline.

We had eagerly booked for Sunday lunch and boy were we not dissappointed.

Food was fantastic and so tantalising, that we forgot to take so many of the photos

Service by their Manager Shahjahan and his team, XinTian and Jin was superb. All four of us, who have worked in the travel industry were most impressed

Good job and we look forward to our next visit!"
Horrible experience,"Horrible Experience. Firstly, I've been using the Amex Love Dining Menu but Wooloo has the weirdest requirement. 24 hours notice to order this. I just had the experience in another restaurant but never had this problem. Fair enough, secondly i found out Raj has left the restaurant. I asked for another server who is a lady and always serve me and knows my dietary requirements but she has also left. A recent staff i just met, by the name of Weizheng has also left. Something must be very wrong with the management for all the staff to be leaving. Small matter. However, i realize how understaffed the restaurant was for a dinner service. Thirdly, lack of manpower which of course leads to slow service. My steak was also not done right and even if i wanted to change it, the staff can be seen running everywhere and I gave up. Sorry to say but i guess my days with Wooloo is over."
Awesome lunch,"Had an awesome lunch here. Ordered the grilled asparagus which was crunchy and well charred as well as the hokkaido wagyu which was melt in ur mouth. There were alot of sauces and condiments. Even when I asked for salt, there were several variety of salts such as charcoal salt. Overall, great food here."
Delicious meal at a cosy restaurant with nice ambience,"We went for the 5 course Amex set dinner, all courses were generally very delicious especially the cauliflower soup and the Nebraska steak. The different courses could be served a little faster but the overall service was really attentive and good. Portions could be a little bit bigger too especially considering the price, however overall a delicious meal in a nice, cosy and warm ambience.

It’s a restaurant I will return to."
"Excellent service, quality food",Excellent service and good quality food. Had the 5 course set meal. One of the best steak ever. Strongly recommended
Wooloomooloo Steakhouse,Was there for the weekend brunch. Love the ambience and the food was excellent. But now no more free flow of bread.
Awesome dining experience,Went there to celebrate spouse's birthday and ordered a superb beef. Just that the preparation time for the beef is too long.
Top quality beef!!,Only negative was the noise as very busy! Acoustics would benefit from soft wall or seat coverings. We will be back soon as the food was excellent.
Excellent Services and Wonderful Dinning Experience,"Valuable set lunch, excellent services, wonderful meal, very attentive staffs, great setup and pleasant atmosphere."
Excellent Food & Service,One of the best dinning environments with excellent food and service Must return again soon. What should I have next time?
Good Food,"Food was good, service was fine mostly, except the fact that the waiter & waitress keep repeating the $25 cake corkage fee if we want to cut the birthday cake I brought.
I already said no problem but the reminder was repeated 6 times, until I told them to stop. I believed if I can afford to eat in such a costly restaurant, I am able to afford paying an extra $25 to cut my cake. Not sure why the restaurant staff go to such extend to annoy their guest in this manner."
Perfect,"Had last minute reservation and we did not regret it! Atmosphere were really good, nice selection of wine and great steak! What made it most special is their staff whom were very friendly and accomodating! Special mentioned to Felix, Jenny and Raj! Kuddos to the team and we will definitely be back soon!"
Excellent Service & Experience,"Love the food, service and the whole experience! Everyone there is super attentive and friendly :) Kudos to the whole team!"
Four out of five,Every item on the menu was deemed to be a culinary excellence by our group. Superstar Shah redeemed the many bloopers made by the inexperienced wait staff. Kindly make the necessary tweaks to make Wooloomooloo a place of regular haunt for us.
Went for my girlfriend’s birthday,"Opted for ala carte
- lobster bisque: portion a little small as we were sharing it, but taste is awesome
- Hokkaido scallop: 3 scallops for 35++, a tad bit expensive but tasted really special
- 1 x Australian ribeye and 1 x fillet mignon. Portion is fairly huge and served with 4 sauces which I kept mixing and matching.
Carbs: black truffle potato purée. Basically mash potato, but with truffle. Tasted good

Dessert: yuzu sorbet. Very refreshing, to cleanse our palette after the savory/salty meal.

Special thanks to the staff for making it a great experience, checking in with us at every turn to make sure our food was ok. Even threw in a birthday cake for my gf. 10/10 would come back again."
Overpriced,"Went for the weekend lunch set, all dishes are tasty & flavourful..
only disappointing dish - the steak.. ordered medium-rare, but the steak is more like medium-well.. and the steak itself also tasted like any other ordinary steakhouse..
overpriced for a normal steak in a highend steakhouse"
Otherwise a wonderful dining experience marred by a substandard USDA prime rib eye steak.,"Superb service by the lady who served us. Despite the disappointing rib eye steak, every other dish was great. The lovely lady who served us offered complimentary desserts and served us a-replacement steak which looks great but unfortunately we could not eat it as we were full after having the desserts. The restaurant handled the situation very well and we were quite happy dining there despite one bad item."
Business Meeting,We had a rib-eye and filet. Both were done perfectly. The wine recommendations were also wonderful. Will definitely be back
"Excellent food, service and ambience","Brought my wife there for our wedding anniversary celebration, loved the ambience the lighting was romantic, the service staff were attentive and spot on with their recommendations.. the food.. tried 3 dishes and all impressed: the wagyu tomahawk, wanted it done medium and it came just as it should be, good amount of meats and fats, and their sauces were good… the bread that goes with the pan seared foiegras was super, the foiegras was tasty, the cheese ham appetizer was tasty and goes well with the greens, will definitely come again to try other stuff on their menu"
Great service,"The atmosphere is superb, great service by Felix. We really enjoyed our visit there. Food was nicely cooked, very worth it in terms of quality and portion."
Front desk reception is the first step of a dining experience. Please get it right.,"I had a rsvp for 715pm. I arrived early at 645pm. Reception advised seating time is 2 hours because she had to turn the tables?

I called her bluff asking what was her last seating time. She showed her bookings, it said 830pm. refused to budge and kept requesting me to come back at 715?

For such a 'premium steakhouse', EXTREMELY poor poor service by the front receptionist. went in, and I couldn't even choose to sit at the windows?! Cited all reserved. I requested for a window seat in advance. The whole point of me entering early and agreeing to your 2 hour rule and I can't get a window seat? what in the world....

I dont need to review the food because you spoilt my appetite."
good service and very good food,The service by your team was very good! the food was impeccable and fresh! we tenderloin quality was very lean and well cooked
Horrendous service by the supervisor,"I have been here and it’s one of my favourite steak places but last night was one of the worst experiences I have ever faced with a service staff in my entire life. The restaurant should do something about it.
It was a night where things didn’t start off right. The supervisor serving made no attempt to try to make the situation better. He totally aggrieved myself further and this was totally uncalled for from a service staff. .
First he made no effort to make situation better when we didn’t want a seat by the kitchen. He stood right fixed in middle the restaurant and told us it’s fully booked. We either take the seat right beside the kitchen or opposite it. There were many empty seats around and away from the kitchen towards the door. The least he could do was to sound apologetic and not serve with a take it or leave it attitude.
When asked for the in charge to be spoken to, he rudely replied that he is the supervisor. When he has a manager in the house. Instead he questioned my intend of asking for the manager and made no attempt to soften grounds.
Much more happened and things got smoothen out when Sham the manager came out. He was all apologetic. That helped but the bad aftertaste remained.
The rest of the night was really ruined by the abhorrible attitude of the supervisor on duty on 7th July dinner shift.
This is extremely disappointing for myself. Extremely; after many times of having good steak and fine service. Kindly look into it."
A great evening!,"I had a great catch up with two friends the other night. An enjoyable evening - good food, good wine and the service was good given the table service team seemed a little inexperienced - it was a full night and to be fair they handled that well. Overall a great night - thanks to the team!"
Good service,Is a good environment to dinning in and grateful to Rowen and Jin for their great services. Will be going again .
Great night out for birthday celebration,"great ambience, service team were warm and approachable, food was fantastic
my wife, son and daughter said it was their best restaurant experience in a very long time"
All sides surpassed the mains!,"A few things stood out for us in this steakhouse. One, the steaks come with four different sauces - yes, FOUR little pots of sauces to use. Second, the scallops starter was amazing. Topped with caviar, wrapped with crispy bacon, resting on a mango sauce, the scallops were out of this world. Third, the jumbo crab cake was super yummy. Not the best I’ve tasted - that honour goes to the crab cake in stellar-at-one-altitude, which has closed for good recently. But it is the next best one around. Fourthly, the lobster bisque was rich and inside was a large strip of lobster meat - which was cooked to perfection! Fifthly, be sure to get the creamy corn as vegetables. I think the corn was mixed with some milk concoction - fantastic.

A little tip: if ordering the steak, get medium-rare. I had medium and it felt
like medium-well. I didn’t complain since there’s nothing that can be done about it - one can’t undo a doneness level right?

Service was cheerful and attentive throughout; even after footing the bill, the water refills continued tirelessly. Very good!

Will I return? Yes for sure (though not in the near future - because I’m not a major fan of steaks)."
New management with EXCEPTIONAL service,"I’ve been here a couple of times, mainly because the food here is wonderful. I was glad to know that there was a change of management recently. If you look closely, he’s guiding his team very well, a young chap. I’m guessing he has either a strong customer service background or a training background! I’m definitely a loyal customer now with so much improvement of service and looking forward to what this restaurant can achieve in the nearer future! Side note, loving the wagyu tomahawk!!"
Lunch,"I have been to wooloomooloo many times before and it had always been fantastic with a good value for money lunch. Unfortunately, on todays occasion, it was a disappointment as the bread (which previously was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside) is quite hard and tough (i was told they changed supplier) and the rib eye (having paid an extra supplement for) had quite a bit of tendons hence not edible. The service however remains OK with waiters (seems to be a rather high turnover) checking on you though they seemed less happy than the ones I have previously met. Perhaps management should take a look why there's such a high turnover of staff? Of note, the manager is also new? He made his best attempt to help and to my surprise even offered to inform the chef of my feedback on the slightly substandard food so the chef can come out to 'chat' to me.... I did decline this as I thought it would be an embarrassment to the restaurant in front of so many customers...."
Awesome Service!,Food was delicious and the service provided by the crew was awesome. It was my wife's birthday and they sprung a little surprise for her. Thanks Wooloomooloo! We had a wonderful experience dining there.
no different comparing with other family restaurant,"there is no differ taste comparing other cheaper stake restaurant, i will prefer to other restaurant for next family dinner"
Standards dropped alarmingly,"When you see a table d'hote with a buy one get one free offer that should tell you something.
This place used to be very good. its now poor.
on arrival a young boy asked us who we were then promptly ignored us and left us standing at the door
Eventually a woman who wasn't in any uniform nor had any name badge asked quite rudely ""who are you?"" the child who booked us in said nothing.
At the table it was chaos we hadn't even sat down when another youth came and started moving our cutlery and another brought bread
There were lots of schoolchildren who bluntly didn't have a clue. I was alarmed to see the maître D in white plimsolls and jeans.
The oysters were ok apart from one of the schoolchildren dressed as waiters attempting to remove my plate before I had even finished then for no apparent reason bringing me a butter knife (I had not taken bread nor butter). When we had finished everything was just left on the table and when the mains arrived and I wads asked to move my starter plate, which I was left holding.
We ordered a filet mignon medium rare - it was just about rare and a shapeless lump of meat without taste and quite tough, my ribeye was not medium rare but medium
One of the more adult waiters had promised to decant my wine, he instead left it by the cash register and eventually only brought it and decanted when my food arrived. Sadly what didn't arrive were glasses !
The sides were pretty disappointing and giving me a ""serving"" fork with creamed spinach ??
The more adult waiter cheerily asked ""how is the doneness of your steak and I repeated what I had typed - his only response was ""I will tell the chef"" after that he ignored us and we couldn't even get served.
Every time I put my cutlery in the ""I am still eating position"" I had to wave away an annoying boy waiter - who incidentally was wearing a shirt with huge wet sweat
stains on it ! The wine had a HUGE amount of sludgy sediment - the casually attired head waiter told me that was normal - I have never encountered it in a Sononoma Zinfandel before - to me it was stored badly. The head waiter simply shrugged - this was a $230 plus bottle of wine.
We ordered dessert eventually and it was plonked in centre of the table and no crockery or cutlery was provided. I doubt I wanted to eat crème brule with my hands.
VERY disappointing - food quality dropped alarmingly staff and service appalling"
1st Visit to the Best Steakhouse in Singapore,"My family loves a good steak. Very glad that Wooloomooloo did not disappoint us. The Beef Wellington was the best I’ve ever eaten. The Porterhouse steak was tasty but a bit over-done. The edges were slightly burnt and dry.
However, the service staff were very professional - pleasant and attentive.
We will definitely pay another visit soon."
Strange rule,"Went there with my family over the weekend. Not sure why the restaurant does not allow individual to order set menu unless everyone on the table order set menu. I find it strange, esp I have two kids on the table definitely they are not able to finish all the food in the set menu. We don't want to waste food and definitely not a good example for the kid as well. Why is a high end restaurant does not understand such a basic thing? Not a pleasant way to start a meal even some dishes are good."
birthday dinner,"as good as it usually is. pretty satisfied with special occasion celebration. Service, food, Atmosphere, all good."
"Awesome service, good food and ambience","Ambience is warm and nice, service staff polite and welcoming. Steak was a little overdone for me and they offered to make a new one which was cooked perfectly! Good food, good service, will return!"
Friendly Service,"Lunch here was interesting, and the food was generally good. We had not been back for the past two years, due to Covid restrictions, and with easing of the restrictions, the place was packed. There were some new staff, and that resulted in a couple of smashed glasses and service mishaps in the dining area, but these were minor.

We started with the onion bread, which was freshly baked and soft. We both went for the suckling pig, which was crispy and tasty. The cauliflower soup was okay. The wagyu beef pasta was quite a generous portion, so much so that we both could not finish the dish. The meat was fork tender and full of flavour, if a tad on the salty side. The desserts were,okay, and a nice end to the meal.

Overall, it was a pleasant lunch., with friendly service."
Outstanding,"We had the 3 course meal and all I can say it was outstanding. We chose the 250 day rib stake which came at an extra cost but worth the value. Probably one of the best steaks I ever had.
Service was perfect, very attentive and friendly."
Great,"The food is fantastic, I love they beef . We order set menu , all dishes are great. Thank you so much"
Great weekend Dinner Place,Went with some friends for a dinner on Saturday evening. This is the first time I tried this steak place. We ordered the 5 course dinner together with a bottle of red wine. The food was good and we had a great time.
Good food and good service,"Very pleasant evening in a cosy setting with great city view .
Professional service level and good food ,"
Very pleasant experience,"The food is good and portion was generous. The service is good too, staff knew the menu well, and most willing to accommodate. I’ll definitely come again with friends and family."
Good quality,"Good quality is steak. Price in higher side. Wine selection was adequate, though over prized. Good ambiance"
Great dining experience,Food was good and service was excellent. The server ( tall Chinese guy ) was very efficient and attentive towards us. Serve was delivered with finesse and great awareness as he make the effort to bid his customer goodbye.
AMAZING EXPERIENCE,"Atmosphere , set up , service and food . Amazing combination to spend a great time .
Best Steak tartare in town , great crab cake and wines . TOP !!!"
Amazing!,"I am truly happy with the overall experience with the team at Wooloomooloo! Totally recommended! The team is so forth coming and they prep well for my colleague’s birthday. It’s truly a wonderful meal and experience.
Keep up the good synergy of the team and thank you for your services :))"
Great food and service!,"Had dinner at Wooloomooloo to celebrate my husband's birthday on Saturday 19/03/2022. I have been here many times and I especially like their value-for-money set lunches. It is my go-to for meals when I want nice ambience and reliable food and service.

We had the iceberg lettuce with lump crab salad, a tomahawk steak, the baked potato and a few other sides. Every dish was done to perfection and I loved that the staff make suggestions so that we do not over order and waste. They plated the salad for us separately (there were 4 of us) and recommended we order more sides only after we were served and sure we needed more.

The staff checked to make sure that the food was done to our satisfaction so I was surprised to see another table of diners kick up a fuss over the doneness of their steak. And they complained after finishing 90% of their steak! . In my opinion, any diner that has any issue with their food should bring it up after 1 or 2 mouthfuls or even on sight, seeing as any burnt parts of a steak is immediately obvious to the eye. If you complain after eating 90% of it and demand a refund, that is very unfair to the establishment. After all, they did polish off 90% of an inedible steak!

My personal experience with establishments like Wooloomooloo is that they will ask about the food if a large portion is untouched. That gives diners a chance to bring up the issue for the restaurant to address if the customer was shy to bring it up initially.

To add insult to injury, I think these diners left some bad reviews too. I hope people reading these reviews check the number and type of reviews left by such reviewers. Some people are just impossible to please (all 1* reviews with so much bitterness) and some just decide to leave a bad review (having never ever reviewed any other place) because they could not get a free meal. That’s horrible and I’m finally leaving my review because I feel hard done by for the staff and want to set things right.

I am a steak lover and have been to all of the steakhouses we have in Singapore. Wooloomooloo might not be the most expensive steakhouse in Singapore but the quality of food and service (given the tight labour market) is up there, if not better, than the rest of them.

The F&B scene is just recovering from a scalding two years. Let’s be reasonable and not give them an unnecessary hard time.

Kudos to the Wooloomooloo crew for their patience with cheap diners."
Happy birthday lunch,We ordered a porterhouse steak which was really tender. Service was excellent and the Happy Birthday decorations were a surprise!
Not as great as it used to be,"I was kept waiting for 5 mins before I was showed to the table where my other guests were.
The food serving was slow. The doneness of the beef was not as they were requested for 2 guests.
When I first visited this restaurant, ut was great. But on this day, it was a disappointment."
Decent food but nothing spectacular,"I had a love dining set meal comprising of a beef carpaccio, cauliflower soup, crab cake, steak and citrus yuzu / cheesecake. Overall, the sauces were over seasoned and the plating was normal. The much anticipated crab cakes were disappointing. It feels like the chefs are part timers who used to work at Ashtons. The only redemption were the carpaccio and yuzu citrus. I wouldn’t say its worth the price tag of $168++. For that amount, there are better places to feast at."
Perfect dinner for wife's birthday,Every food was good. I feel like becoming a good husband reserving this restaurant. I would visit again near future.
Never been disappointed. Always a perfect evening.,"Bestest service from Rowan Raj, from Wooloomooloo. Went the extra mile, as usual. Tks Noel, Jun n Dinesh too. Food was top notch, wine was yums n the entire evening was a blast! The night cap at the end was appreciated as well.

I have dined at this restaurant many times. I always found the staff very polite and professional, even when I could see that they were understaffed. They are very attentive to details and make you feel like u are at home.
Keep up the good work, Noel and team!"
"Slow service, steak cooked unevenly, atmosphere is fine.","Slow service, and certain part of the steak is overcooked, staff initiatives are slow to assist, really underwhelming restaurant to visit."
Birthday dinner,"Really good experience here for my husbands 40th birthday. The food was good quality, service was great and price was reasonable. My kids were freezing at one point and the manager noticed them shivering and turned down the air at our booth. We had a great celebration and would recommend this restaurant."
Big portion of beef!,"We ordered two different beefs and the portion was huge. The US beef tasted marvellous even without dipping into any sauce. The Australia beef lost out a bit as texture is slightly hard. Side dishes were huge portion too. We had fries and mac & cheese. The fries are nice, salty and crispy. Oh the truffle mushroom soap tasted pretty good too."
"Not bad, could be better","Beef Wellington was disappointing, not wound tightly, plenty of gaps between the beef and the pastry

Fillet mignon was great, better than most steakhouses in Singapore.
Lobster bisque fantastic.

Service was average, did what they supposed to do, but no personal touch. the Ang Moh was swooned over by the manager though"
More to be desired,"Bad service.
Had the Valentine’s Day set menu.
Amuse bouche came the same time as the first course, crowding the table.
Server didn’t explain what each dish was
Server doesn’t serve from the diner’s left.
Server didn’t provide any warning that the dish the pork dish was served on was hot.
Not sure why every other review listed the service as very good and attentive. Maybe the restaurant couldn’t cope with the Valentine’s Day crowd.
Only redeeming part of the service was Xin Tian ,the server, who was very polite.

Food was mediocre, steak was sort of what you would expect from jacks place or Aston’s.
Argentine pink prawn and crab bisque was awful, not sure if the prawn was supposed to be so mushy. I’ve had raw prawns which have a mushy yet crisp texture, but this was just pure mush. Not sure if this was intended.
Pork dish was alright, nothing to write home about.
Fillet steak was awful, tasted grainy and overcooked.
Dessert was the only redeeming dish. Miso ice cream was interesting."
Supervisor spoil the overall service,Crews services are great but Supervisor spoil everything. Host ordered the wine and should be host test the wine not my guest. Booking for 5 seats but bring me to a 4 seat table. totally unacceptable on these part of the service.
Family Lunch,"It took a while for someone to show us in, but we were taken care of once we were attended. My wife is wheelchair-bound, but that didn't deter anyone from the restaurant. We were attended to professionally and with one of the best customer service I have encountered in a while. While this is not the first time for me being at the restaurant, it was undoubtedly the first time I have encountered excellent service and friendly encounters. I would like to thank Felix (I hope I got his name right) to focus on our needs and being patient with our requests. Our needs did not go unnoticed. My family and I genuinely appreciate the subtle actions to serve and take care of us. It was also my daughter's and my birthday, and Felix's surprise cake and candles after he found out is lovely and an excellent way to end the lunch. I should have taken the person who showed us in, but thanks very much for attending to my wife's needs!! Oh yes, before I forget, the food at Wooloomoloo is to die for!!!! Always fantastic and always getting the doneness to exactly how we want it!!!"
Horrible Service,"The food was Excellent. But it was shocking how their service was terrible from the start to the visit. No single staff came to our table unless we called the staff. The service at the bar was awful, taking forever to make a single drink not even being water while waiting and very disappointed with the taste of Aperol sprit, the waiter didn't understand or rejected my ask for doing something to do with it. It wouldn't be the place I can bring my clients or boss."
Good place to celebrate an occasion,"We enjoyed the steak, beef tartare, barramundi and Italian wine very much. The high end wine was reasonably priced though the rest of food and drinks are on the higher end. Overall lovely evening with the family and a great place for celebration."
Tomahawk cutting is too thick,"We have ordered cold cut, grilled asparagus, hash brown and tomahawk for a family of 4. The portion is good but the tomahawk cutting is too thick and so tender."
Disappointing steak,Ambience was great but steak is a disappointment. My medium well Filet Mignon was served charred on the outside but some parts inside were still red. My sis had asked for medium rare but hers turned out fully cooked.
Great service but food went cold very fast,Brought my team for a business dinner and the services was great but unfortunately we were seated directly under the aircon vents and our food (steak) became cold too fast and really didn't end up enjoying it as much as we did the last couple of times there
Good food but noisy environment,Food and service are good but the ambience can be quite noisy. It will be annoying if you prefer a quiet place to have you meal.
Wonderful night,"Lovely night with nice setting, food and wine.. This is coupled with excellent services from Rowen and Shaffy. Superb!"
Family dinner,Excellent service and staff were friendly. Good ambiance. Good variety in menu. Will come again. best steak
Really good steak,"My wife and I had dinner here last October 2021, ordering special set ‘AMEX’ menu. This restaurant is located at Raffles City shopping center, near access to Stamford Hotel.
The ambience was nice, services were very good and foods were delicious, from the bread to the steak as main menu, both were really superb. Worth your time and visit if you’re craving for steak while in Singapore."
Good service and good food,First time going to this restaurant and I’m happy with their good quality food and the best is their steak and also good service.
"Nice food, moderate portions","The taste was great, meat (salmon and steak) was cooked nicely, portion was a bit smaller than expected. More fine dining than the Australian steak house I’m used to. If you are planning to use Amex promotions, do ask first as most are not applicable."
Attentive staff with impeccable service,Busy Tuesday night but staff was attentive and always available to help with a smile. Steak was over cooked (medium instead of medium rare per our order) but otherwise was delicious.
First time at Wooloomooloo Singapore,The restaurant is located at a corner of the hotel. Took us awhile to find it. We were seated at a nice cozy spot - able to see the Padang. The staff were friendly and helpful. The food were excellent. The only downside was the noise - people talking.
Value for money weekday set lunch,"Value for money weekday 3 course set lunch, will return again. The only spoiler was the guest relations officer asked at door to identify the birthday gal, really a spoiler for the planned surprise 😠"
Nice ambience with great food and service,"This is our first visit to this restaurant for a birthday celebration.
Love the ambience and the service.
Food wise we ordered the caeser salad with grilled chicken breast, seared hokkaido scallops as starters. Main were barramundi as well as steak along with sides of truffle mac and cheese and wild mushroom.
All the dishes were tasty and we really enjoyed the lunch. Will be back for sure."
Good food,"Restaurant was busy, reservations recommended. Xmas set was value for money as good quality is good."
Wonderful dinner experience,"We love Wooloomooloo and we have been visiting the restaurant at least once a year since 2019. The staff are very attentive, friendly and warm. The food are also very good. We will definitely visit them again"
Unsatisfactory service,"Our family went for the Christmas Day dinner, but unfortunately, the service was inadequate and poor. Had to repeatedly remind them to tend to us, and that alone took away some of the enthusiasm in dining there. Maybe they are busy, but probably could have envisioned this, and have more service staff. The mandatory deposit process was also a little confusing."
Good experience and food,"Nice ambience, good food, good wine. Servicing is a little slow due to the festive period but acceptable. Strong savory taste which might not suit all. Love the tomahawk and the crab cake."
