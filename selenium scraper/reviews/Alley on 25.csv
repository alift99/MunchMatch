CNY Celebrations 2023,"Alley on 25 is tops in my list for International Buffet with wide selections to whet everyone‚Äôs appetite. It‚Äôs really a food galore and free flow of soft drinks, coffee and tea.

We were privileged to have Razif Shah to attend to our needs that leaves us full and satiated. Always ready to offer a suggestion and ensuring we had a good start for the Lunar Rabbit New Year. Kudos to him and the rest of the staff in attendance .

We are ready to hop into the Rabbit year with hopes and zeal ."
Amazing service,"My family of 8 stayed for 11 nights at the Andaz and had the pleasure of eating breakfast each morning at Alley on 25,the service and quality of food is exemplary.
Kasthuri and Thiruna organised the same table for us each morning which was done without prompting,simply awesome.
Each morning we were met by the staff with such warmth and a welcoming attitude it made our stay so pleasant."
Dinner at Alley on 25,We had a great time! DFood was delicious and Harmon who served us was really nice and helpful. Definitely recommend
Alley on 25,Nice ambience and very attentive service staff. Variety of food was a tad limited. Would be better if they could expand the variety.
Good Ambience,"Food is great and ambience is great. Romantic lighting which was what i liked since i'm light sensitive. A minor detail is perhaps the music can be a tad bit softer, especially for songs which were more upbeat."
Best hotel ever !!,Good breakfast spread! Wonderful service from the team especially Othman and Razif! Andaz Singapore has always been my preferred hotel!!
Memorable Dinner Experience,The ambience and food experience were great for us. We ordered some Asian cusines for sharing and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.
Great service and good variety of food,Had a really great time with my partner on Christmas Eve. The spread (across 3 sections) was large but did not compromise the quality of the food. The wait staff were incredibly attentive as well without being invasive.
2nd visit and looking forward to more visits,"Like how the dining time is catered for a ""lazy"" brunch crowd. There's more than enough time to enjoy the buffet spread from 12 to 2.30pm. Love the idea of also getting to select a main to prepared upon ordering.

Service was top grade. Every staff was attentive and was proactive to offer something. One of the best in SG so far.

Adding on to the location and ambience, this has to be the top choice for a weekend brunch buffet."
Very Nice New Year Eve Dinner,"Came with my family to celebrate the end of 2022! Great food, Great Staff and Great Experience. One of the places I will definitely recommend to people looking for a great dining experience."
Staff were awesomely friendly!,"Nice atmosphere especially after it's renovation, huge place. Great food selections & wine list. Decent price. Service excellent! Baby friendly."
Lazy Breakfast on New Year Day,"Thanks Alley on 25 for giving us an amazing start to the new year 2023. The Lazy Breakfast was a memorable quality family time with delicious food, ambient atmosphere, the friendly staff and the super service. Thanks Kasthuri was attending our all needs and we are fully satisfied and will definitely visit again. Thanks and a happy new year!!"
Christmas Dinner,We were served by Horman and Razif. I would say they provided excellent service. The food was great as usual. We were also well taken care of when we had our drinks at bar square. The bartender (did not manage to get his name) was nice enough to recommend us an amazing cocktail (nostalgia) to end our lovely Christmas night.
Great service and food!,Fantastic food and service by the Alley on 25 staff! Thank you! I would highly recommend this place for a good dinner.
Dinner Night,We were served by Horman. Excellent service and perfect ambience. Highly recommended. Will come back again. Thank you!
Alley on 25,Food was good and Served by Horman who was friendly and willing to help. Had a cheerful night here. üòä
Lim,"Attentive and wonderful service , esp by Horman . Good food with reasonable pricing. Definitely a good choice for family celebrations üòÄ"
Christmas dinner saved!,"Booked what I read as Christmas buffet dinner, only to be asked to order at the table. Upon closer inspection, the menu showed dinner for Christmas Eve but only lunch hours for Christmas Day.

That said: restaurant staff calmly apologised for the confusion, took in my feedback, and was very forthcoming in taking our orders from the regular menu. Service was warm and efficient.

And that regular menu is quite worth it. We ordered the oven-baked salmon, the char kway teow (local dish), satay, and spaghetti Bolognese (so good that my son had two servings!).

A special shout out to Harmon and ‚ÄòUncle‚Äô (forgot to ask his name) who made sure the kids were happy with their meal. Perfect service recovery.

As for the confusion: I‚Äôd expect menus and posts to be proofread before posting online. That Christmas menu is definitely not clear."
Breakfast,"We had breakfast at Alley on 25. The service was great from start to end, namely by Caleb, Kean and Thiru. The food isn‚Äôt halal but there are many vegan/vegetarian options üëç"
Andaz Christmas Eve Buffet,"Services provided by Jonas, Razif and team are fantastic! During the meal, there is magic show and a surprise visit by Santa too! The kids enjoyed themselves very much!"
Christmas Eve Dinner,It was a lovely evening for us. The restaurant hired a magician to perform tricks for every table! Super impressive!
Christmas Eve Dinner and birthday celebration,"Food is delicious and the service is efficient. The waiter and waitress were very friendly, making the dinner very enjoyable"
attentive service,"many thanks to Jonas and team for being attentive to our needs and we had a wonderful time. Jonas could even tell what we wanted (another round of pita bread) just from our gestures! he even read the items on our receipt aloud when the print was too small for us :)

it's one reason why we return to the restaurant each year to celebrate my birthday ."
Christmas staycation,We stayed at Andaz for a Christmas staycation and tried out Alley on 25 for dinner. The food and and ambience was excellent. Jonas and team provided fantastic service. Would happily go back again for dinner!
Alley on 25 Festive Afternoon Tea,"Visited Alley on 25 for their festive afternoon tea and we were a group of 4. Nothing to rave about unless decent ambience passes as a selling point. Do not expect an array of tea selections like other hotels and let your mind settle in for Singapore Breakfast, Earl Grey, Peppermint, Sencha (1-2 more choices) and mediocre coffee. Food was way below average standard, some cafes / restaurants would probably win hands down without much debating.

Just when one thought that service might be the saving grace of this bad culinary experience, I beg to differ. Food was not served according to the group size until guests pointed out to the service crew (same thing happened to the table behind us). 2 sets of 4 sweets selection were not served, trust that this would be an easy task to resolve however, service crew came back with 3 sets of 4 sweets selection - all nicely laid on a big plate served on our table. Highlighted the extra servings issue to the service crew, left us hanging as we didn't know what was the decision and if we could start with our food. Subsequently a service crew came over to our table with an empty plate telling us that she would need to take back the extra servings from the big plate (which had our servings and extras). She started attempting to shift the extra sweets selection to her empty plate right in front of us. Quite an alarming experience - especially from a 5-star hotel. No issues to correct the mistake but shouldn't this be done behind the scenes, away from the customers and also from a hygiene stand-point.

Personally, I will not recommend the afternoon tea for anyone."
Hellman,"Wonderful breakfast served by amazingly attentive and friendly staff, especially grateful to Othman."
BIRTHDAY DINNER WITH FAMILY,It was my aunt's birthday and we decided to book a spot here! Ambience was great and the foos was even better! Staff were friendly and quick to attend to our needs. Will definitely reccommend:)
Value for money,"We had a semi-buffet brunch here. Service was definetly great, the serbice crew are attentive and friendly. Food was okay nothing spectacular , we paid extra for wine and champange to celebrate our friend birthday. A good alternative option if cannot book at your first choice of place."
Birthday,Alley@25 a great place to be in the city centre. Appreciate the service provided by Hormqn & Vasu. Great ambience with good quality tasty food.
Perfect Date Night,We were served by Horman and Vasu. Excellent service and perfect ambience. Highly recommended. Will come back again. Thank you!
Mr. Dhruva Vishwanathan,Exceptional service .. had a lovely evening üòä. We went for a birthday celebration. The food and service are great the staff was friendly and accommodative. They even surprised us by giving a complimentary cake.
Cozy and welcoming,Came here on a quiet Sunday afternoon. You can try the delactable the truffle mushroom rissoto and Thai iced tea. We were well served by the friendly Mr Othman.
Great service,Great service by Horman who was very attentive and made sure we were satisfied with our food. Good place for a chill weekday dinner.
Awesome service,"We had the thanksgiving buffet. There were plenty of servers around. They were constantly checking on my son (on crutches) to see if he needs anything. Special shout out to the host, Jovin, for being so prompt and helpful with emails when I asked for a table near the spread coz of my son. Food wise: starters were good. Shrimps - fresh and plump. Salads - refreshing. Turkey and dessert were ok. Food was constantly refilled - a sign of good management. Definitely worth a repeat visit !"
Valley on 25,"Waiter - Thiruna is a very attentive waiter, his service is top notch and the lazy breakfast buffet is wonderful! Very delicious! Thumbs up to Thiruna service! Salute"
Can try,"Average Service, wasn't asked if I had reservation, went looking for the place myself. layout was confusing for first timer. Service crew was new on the job, was little confused too"
Kampung Glam Afternoon Tea,"The presentation was nostalgic and pretty. The food items were more hits than misses. Items that were to our liking include sambal prawn sandwich, chicken rice aracini, beef rendang tartlet. We had high expectations for the fish otah bun and chicken satay slider after a pleasure experience eating the other items, but were disappointed with the fish otah that lacked authenticity and slider bun that was tough & flavourless.

Nonetheless, the overall experience was pleasant with interesting fusion of spices into the food and welcoming service by the staff."
High tea at the Alley on 25,"Celebrated my cousin‚Äôs birthday and it was great! The staff were very welcoming, attentive and thoughtful. Jonas, Jovin, Othman and Razif were great as they celebrated my cousin‚Äôs birthday with a song and a complimentary cake. They also printed out a photo for us as a souvenir of our visit. Totally will come back again and recommend anyone coming for a birthday celebration."
Wedding Anniversary Dinner,"Had wanted a simple, quiet dinner with family. Horman gave us attentive service especially the moment of handing us the softee & brownie combi rendering a great photo memory. I especially love the char kway teow full of wok hei served with chilli by the side. Of course, we also had the much raved about drunken seafood along with the fish & chips for the little ones."
Great food and great service,"My friends and I are fans of Alley on 25‚Äôs drunken seafood (Green Oven). We were so impressed by Uncle Othman who served us with such meticulousness and humour. It is evident that he has a wealth of experience in this line under his belt. Thank you, Uncle Othman, for sharing bits of your 51- year journey in hospitality with us. We respect you and your loyalty to your profession tremendously. You have shown us what it means to love what we do so that we can do it for a long time.
Alley on 25 is one of my favourite places because of its ambience, food and service. Tonight, it has become my two friends‚Äô too.
Thank you!"
Birthday celebration,The drunken seafood & salmon papilotte are delicious! The soft serve also very pretty presentation. We were served by a very experienced server named Othman! Superb service!
Food,Was served mussels that was obviously dead before cooking as it did not open after cooking. Grill Chicken was dry.
Breakfast Buffet,"My friends an I had a wonderful time at Alley on 25. My pregnant friend was even escorted to her seat.
Food was amazing and they had a wide spread of varieties. They were fast & efficient with their service and never rushed us to leave the place. Had an extremely pleasant day with Alley on 25.
I would definitely head back there for their breakfast buffet spread!"
"A pleasant evening, and nice to have had been back at the Andaz/Alley on 25.","Mid-week late July 2022, I darted over to Alley on 25 at the Andaz Singapore for a quick late dinner. It had been a while since I last visited in 2021, and prior to which (pre-COVID) I had frequented this approachable dining/drinks venue.

I stopped by the hotel‚Äôs front desk (Andaz Singapore) to enquire on directions to a separate F&B outlet located nearby the hotel, to which I was planning to visit another day. The front desk crew was helpful, friendly and patiently provided the relevant information and directions.

Subsequently, as I walked towards Alley on 25 (which is located on the same 25/F as the hotel‚Äôs front desk), a friendly service crew greeted me and asked if I had made reservation and at which dining section at Alley on 25. I shared I had just walked-in and would like a bite at The Green Oven. As we both walked up at The Green Oven, she requested her colleague Caleb who was stationed there, to assist me.

Caleb promptly seated me at a cosy round table. I ordered sweet & sour pork and requested sans bell peppers, steamed rice, and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. Caleb said he shall check with the Chef on the request for no bell peppers in the sweet & sour pork, and promptly returned to advise that the Chef had kindly suggested other additional fresh fruit in addition to pineapple and in lieu of bell peppers in the dish. To which, I was much agreeable.

Shortly after, the glass of Sauvignon Blanc was served properly chilled, followed by the sweet & sour pork and a hearty warm bowl of steamed rice. The sweet & sour pork was thoughtfully plated (sans bell peppers, as requested) with fresh fruit lightly tossed in the glossy sauce - bite sized chunks of pineapple, halved strawberries, whole black & green grapes and cherry tomatoes - which enhanced and balanced the sweetness and acidity, and added colour vibrancy to the dish. Comfort food, and an absolute delight, visually and on the palate. Caleb walked over about couple times to see if all was good and if I required anything else.

A pleasant evening, and nice to have had been back at the Andaz/Alley on 25. Thanks, Caleb, Zul, Chef, and the warm and friendly crew!


Best,

First Visit for Early birthday dinner,"Had a great night here as of our first visit to Alley on 25. Nice ambience with soothing lights. Mentioned to the reception during the booking that tonight is for birthday celebration and they actually taken note of it and gave us a small cake for surprise after our meal. The service crew here are very professional and polite, we have been served by Caleb and ShiTing tonight, appreciated for their warmth and great service! Thumbs up!"
Average but somewhat pricey,Food was average. Selection was limited as many items were not available during our visit. Portion is very small for the price (many other restaurants around with better value for money) - not filling at all. Probably might not come here again.
Great Ambiance,The lights are not too bright and the ambience it provides is quiet and not rowdy at all. We feel relaxed and enjoy our meal. We had grilled chicken and oven baked salmon and a vegan bowl which I personally would not recommend though it has a chef hat that indicates preferred choice.
Good service from Horman and a nice place for friends gathering,"Had dinner at Alley on 25 on a Friday.

Horman was friendly and made good recommendation for main dishes and desert, the chiffon cake was especially yummy. Thank you, Horman.

The restaurant has a nice high ceiling and a view to the herb garden.

The environment is pleasant and conducive for conversation.

A good place for friends gathering."
Birthday Celebration,"The foods were so delicious and the staffs here are very friendly. Great to be served by Horman and Shawn as they are very friendly and polite.
Kiddos got free rainbow yummy ice cream too.

Great place for family with kiddos.
Foods were yummmy.
Nice ambience.

Thank you for the great service"
Saturday brunch with Prosecco/wine choice,This restaurant is on the 25th floor but it has disappointing views of Singapore as it overlooks the hotel swimming pool. We had originally booked for the Prosecco brunch but we were initially only offered tea/coffee/ fruit juice which most people were having. We had to say that we wanted the Prosecco even though this wasn‚Äôt given as an option! After we had established this we were served well and given some attention. Basically it is a breakfast service with additional dishes you can order from a menu like eggs and some burgers and steak at additional cost. We stayed with seafood and eggs choice mainly. Food was good particularly the poached eggs. There was however little atmosphere and we felt the whole experience was mediocre.
"Horrible place, definitely not for locals!","Service sucks
Inexperienced waitress
Mispronounced my name a few times
Horrible ambience
Feels like a canteen to me
Ordered a $22 fried rice, and they used frozen seafood, not fresh. I could get the fried rice with fresh seafood for $6 at the hawker centre.
No garnish, feels like a rushed cook.
We came at 7:45pm and left at 8:30.
The fastest date night in our lives. Will not come again."
Duo tenant discount,"Thanks Herman, Jennifer and Shawn for serving my wife and I today. We visited Alley on 25 for dinner after being informed by my office that Duo tenants enjoyed a discount. We loved the capricciosa pizza, which was baked in a wood-fired Beech Oven, and salmon en papillote, which reminded me of meals at home with friends. We will be back for a fuss-free and delicious meal."
Good Service,"Went to Alley on 25 with family and friends. Atmosphere was good and the services was fantastic. Caleb was very helpful and provide advise on how we should order.
Other staffs, Horman, Pei Ling and Benjamin also provided good services.
Only shortfall were the food varieties which can improve and have couple more choices."
Wonderful stay,"Wonderful hotel and staff! Extremely kind and helpful. Multicultural meals, a perfect service. Jeff especially took good care of us during breakfast."
Birthday celebration,"Fantastic foods, friendly staff and superb customer service.. Thank you very much for Mr Jonas, coleb & Jovin. We will come againüëç"
Japanese inspired afternoon tea at Alley on 25,We went for the Japanese inspired afternoon tea on Alley on 25 on a weekday afternoon. There were about 11 items in total and all were well executed. We also enjoyed the tea set using HSBC which was offering 1 for 1. The staffs were friendly and polite and the atmosphere is suitable for gathering with a group of friends or couple. Would definitely visit the place again!
Thanks letter to Jeff Lee,"Jeff Lee is amazing person. He helped me to enjoy every foods in Alley on 25 in the early morning.

The reason why I chose Andaz is this Andaz is new hotel in Singapore. FYI, I prefer newly built hotel always :)

However, the food and service of Andaz is not something new. The employees are young but I am fully enjoying my staying here because of their kind, passionaye and professional service.

Thanks you Jeff and all.

Love.

Great service and great food!,"We went for the Japanese-inspired afternoon tea. The food was amazing and the staff were attentive, and even took the time to explain each course/dish to us."
Dinner and drinks,"Great service and nice ambience. Food was good and reasonably price, however choice of local food quite limited though. Did not manage to secure table by the window with stunning view, which will be a requirement on next visit."
Dinner at Alley on 25,"I was pleasantly surprised by the good food as i came here a month ago and i didnt really like it but this time i came with my family and the experience was much better. We were greeted and served very nicely by William and his other staff who were making us laugh and making the whole atmosphere a very fun and relaxed one. He recommended us the drunken seafood and duck salad, and i was not disappointed one bit, it was very delicious, will definitely comea back."
Breakfast at Andaz Hyatt Singapore,"The Hyatt Andaz breakfast is amazing. It on the 25th floor & is set up as Hawker stations. There are incredible amounts of food to choose from. There is a dim sum station, American station with excellent waffles and pastries, a hit station as well with sausage and eggs. You can tell the waiter how you‚Äôd like your eggs and they‚Äôll make it however you‚Äôd like. The juice station is one of my favorite stations. Not only do they have the standard orange and apple juice, they also have guava and a green detox juice that I look forward to having every single morning Jeff and the whole staff were incredibly welcoming and hospitable, can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
"Must-try pandan chiffon cake, amazing customer care and delicious food","We were seated at Sundown bar on L25 before being ushered to the Alley. Jonas went beyond and offered to carry my heavy bags to the table. Horman was approachable and was patient with us as we ordered our food. The burger, fries and condiments were so good! Laksa was spicy but tasty nonetheless. Not forgetting the pandan chiffon cake which was very delicious and would highly recommend anyone to try! Overall, it was an amazing experience at Alley"
Thank you for the warm hospitality!,"We chanced a dinner at Alley on 25 after our check-out and drinks at Sundown. Totally enjoyed our evening and ending the night with the most amazing Pandan Chiffon Cake!

Big shoutout to Afieq and team - Jonas, Horman and Jenny for your warm hospitality and making our stay at Andaz an amazing one! Thank you all!!

We definitely gonna head back to Andaz for future occasion!"
"Good food, good service","We ordered the burger and the fried rice. Food was decent, service was quick and friendly. Overall a satisfying experience!"
Farewell gathering,"Was there for Hsbc 1 for 1 promotions year ago ...
Everything was fantastic regards food n service n was very impress on the way they prensent the food to the table ""5 ‚òÜ "" service but am feeling very dissapointed this time as food wasn't taste good as a 5 star hotel .
We are the only table for the afternoon tea n i was wondering don't the mangement curious to know why n what is the cause of it ?
Or they are happy with just seeing one table for the afternoon tea ?
Changes of management ?
Going for cheap labour n cheap cost ?"
Lazy Brunch at Alley on 25,"Was here for lazy brunch, celebrating a very good friend‚Äôs birthday! Environment is great, cosy, comfortable. Staff were all helpful and special mention to Zul (the manager in jacket). Very good recommendation on the food and also convinced us to take up the beverage package as we shared that both of us love drinking! Well done and we will be back in time to come!"
Great place to dine with exceptional service,Food was delicious and the ambience was nice. Special thanks to Horman for the attentive service throughout the meal.
Underwhelming,Was a walk in as no vegan options on rooftop bar (Mr Stork). Was quite dull lighting at evening dinner time and was pretty empty which affected the atmosphere. Burger came without changes requested and had to have a new one. Vegan salad option was very basic and not very filling. Just an overage restaurant in our opinion.
Great breakfast and very kids friendly,I came as a walk in not staying in the hotel. I was together with my 2 years old daughter. From the welcome till the farewell a very good service. Very focused as well on the wellbeing of my daughter. Good breakfast selection and very good bread. Jeff the gentleman who took care of us was very welcoming and friendly. Always checking on us. Well done Jeff and see you soon again.
Great food,Booked the restaurant during the holiday season in December as all other restaurants were full. There were not many people when we arrived. Was disappointed as the steak was not available. However the food was delicious. Dessert was too sweet though.
Great Service,"Came here without a reservation to celebrate our anniversary. While the food could be better, we were really impressed with the service level as Caleb and Jonas was very attentive and accommodating. Service recovery due to the long waiting time for food was great too! Appreciate the sweet gesture from the chef - Jovin too.

Thanks and keep it up :)"
The perfect place for a private group celebration,"On 4th June 2022, I held my 50th birthday bash at Andaz Singapore, Smoke & Pepper. It was a last minute decision as we just opened up from Covid-19 restrictions for dining. It was only on 4 May 2022, I started sourcing for a venue for my birthday. Liaising with Anthony Goh, Assistant Manager in F&B Sales for Andaz Singapore provided me with the confidence that my event will be a success if held in the venue.

We met up once and corresponded subsequently through emails, calls and Whatsapps. Many rounds of discussions were made before we finalised on the menu and signed the contract for the actual event.

On the event day, I was introduced to the restaurant team together with Anthony. He made a trip to the venue to ensure that everything was in order and to finalise and help out on some arrangements. He was a wonderful person to work with from the start.

To make story short, the event went through smoothly. From serving the food, to clearing, to setting up my birthday cake, cutting the cake for distribution, everything was done professionally! I have only compliments for the food, the ambience and the place. Many of my guests were very happy with this venue and they enjoyed themselves very much.

However, there were two feedback for improvement. Firstly, the round table that sits 10 persons was very warm in the afternoon. On top of it, the air con leaked. We informed the staff and they immediately got some facilities personnel to look into it. Secondly, some of those who ordered the Australian Angus beef entree found the meat to be tough, even though it was medium doneness.

Despite this feedback, I would still give a 5 stars for the overall experience. I cannot discard the efforts and time spent by the team to make my event a success. I would like to compliment the following staff for their attentiveness and professionalism - Afieq, Zul, Horman, Jeff, Samantha, Natalie and the chef who cuts my cake for distributio. Special mention to Horman who coordinated everything with me, provided me advice and gave me options.

This event would not have been possible without the dedication of the team. With their professionalism, it allowed me to focus on entertaining my guests rather than to worry about the food. My choice wouldn‚Äôt have been better. Thank you to the team for the work well done! Kudos!"
Lazy Breakfast,"Spread was not fantastic, mains were relatively subpar compared to the free flow dishes at the side. However, the seafood platter was amazingly fresh, and what was most commendable was the superb service by the staff!

Pastry chefs readily heated up the stale croissants and pain au chocolat, and were so friendly to make recommendations and introductions of the various dishes. Desserts were not too bad, but somehow lacked the edge of finesse in execution though the taste was alright. Genmaicha soft serve was incredibly smooth and earthy too.

For the price of $59++, wouldn‚Äôt find it value for money compared to other hotels offering an international spread with larger selections and variety. Staff service though was impeccable - special mention to Jovin, who went the extra mile to return my email past midnight upon discovering that his colleague had conveyed a mistaken piece of information to me, and even phoning me to clarify and answer my queries :)

Caleb was also warm and prompt in collecting the done dishes, along with other part-time staffers who were probably students.

Overall, wouldn‚Äôt recommend for value, but would recommend for impeccable service, chilled ambience, and a laid back Lazy Breakfast ;)"
Excellent service team - Jonas Caleb & team,"Ideal Ambience, Attentive team, Portion. Great restaurant for all occasions. Recommend their truffle mushroom risotto & lemon creme brulee!"
Our favourite chill-out place in Singapore,"Tasty food, relaxing ambience, world-class service. Our servers Jonas and Horman were attentive and accommodating. We‚Äôll be back soon to try the delicious-sounding desserts!"
Good ambience,The atmosphere is definitely good however the high tea set is not worth for the money. The tea and coffee selection is very limited.
Great food and service,"Came for Lazy Breakfast on a Monday Public Holiday. Very good quality food. Fresh seafood and fantastic desserts. Responsive service from the team, Horman and Caleb."
Superb service at Alley on 25,"Impeccable service from Iexuan, Isaac and Kavi! Attentive but not over fussy. Ensured that our needs are taken care off.
Food is good quality although options could be better. My son was disappointed that the pizza was not available because he thought it was. It will be in the menu that pops up when you do a google search so that menu better be updated. :)
Best part of the dinner was dessert - love the lemon creme brulee!!"
Great Food during Mother‚Äôs day,"Great Food, Great Ambiance and Amazing service by Herman, Zul and Samantha. The people makes the place. Great job!"
Came here few times and loved the dishes here especially the barramundi and steak,My husband and I Had the sirloin steak and it was good. Loved it. We ordered the Mac and cheese as side for my son and it was not bad too even though the macaroni was the huge pasta kind. My parents had the fried char kway teow and the prawn linguine and portion was just right. Horman and Si Ting was attentive to our table probably also cause there wasn‚Äôt much customers around.
Excellent service at Alley on 25,Table of 6 adults and 2 babies. Waitor Horman is very patient and helpful. Excellent service Hope to patronize the restaurant again.
Great food and fantastic service,"Was here for a long weekend staycation and had the pleasure of dining at Alley on 25.

We ordered Pork Ribs, Pumpkin Soup and the Angus Sirloin Steak. The food was well seasoned and really tasty.

We were served by Horman and was pleasantly impressed by his demeanour and service. He checked in with us on how the food was and even split our soup into 2 smaller portions as we only ordered one bowl.

Would definitely visit again."
Great place for family gathering,"Great food, great ambience and interior deco at The Green Oven. Very friendly services by staff Horman and Shi Ting. Would definitely go back."
Great service!,"The food was splendid as always. Horman, Le Xuan and Isaac were particularly friendly and speedy in their service"
Easter brunch,"My family attended the Easter brunch buffet at Alley on 25 on 17th April. Overall, we enjoyed the selection of food and the ambience, however there were certain issues that left us feeling a bit disappointed. Details below

1. No communication between staff: There was no dedicated server or communication between servers. On several occasions, food that we did not ask for was served to our table. And on the other hand, food that WAS ordered never made it until we had made several inquiries. E.g.: my husband ordered guava juice but was served orange instead. We ordered ice coffee with milk on the side, we only received the coffee. A shepherd‚Äôs pie which we never requested made it to our table. The selection of egg dishes we ordered did not. We noticed that the staff taking our orders would not write anything down. This is an impossible feat to remember, especially at a buffet when there are so many items on the menu for order. It also becomes extremely frustrating when we must repeat ourselves to different servers who show up to the table to take orders. Sometimes within a minute of each other.

2. Mains and desserts served together: All these hang ups invariably caused a delay in our eating and therefore at 2.30 we were asked to order our mains AND desserts as the kitchen was closing at 3pm. We complied without any fuss as this is standard practice. My main was served first but then instead of the rest of the party receiving their orders, we received ALL the desserts instead. Including the ice cream ones! We kindly inquired if these could be stored in the fridge for us but were told it was not possible. So our ice cream sat melting on the table while we waited for the rest of the mains. Ten minutes later we were informed that the burger was no longer available. The order was switched to Steak. Now about 15 mins had passed. The desserts still sitting on the table and no mains in sight. At the Andaz level of service one would expect all the mains to be served together. I believe this is considered common practice even at less established restaurants. And serving of the desserts could have been avoided if they had simply had a system to keep note of the dessert orders and serve them later. Since the kitchen was only closing at 3pm the orders could have been prepped and then stored till atleast we had finished half our mains. Not everything just being sent to the table simply to ‚Äúcomplete a job‚Äù.

3. The presentation and quantity of the food: The marketed photo for this buffet made your mouth water, however sadly in reality the presentation did not. I understand that photos are for ‚Äúillustrative purpose only‚Äù however the difference was so marked that it must be commented upon. The ‚Äúcheese platter‚Äù was just one bread crip with a few triangles of cheese and a handful of fruit and nuts. If you are serving a table of 5 adults and 1 child, there should be sufficient portions given. Its true we could request for additional portions but that just ended up being so tiresome as the orders were being ‚Äúlost‚Äù somewhere in the abyss between server and kitchen. Similarly, the ‚Äúcarving board‚Äù which by the way says ‚ÄúSharing platter‚Äù on the menu, was served in tiny palm size bowls. The sausages cut into 1-inch chunks, a small triangle of ham, one charred carrot, and unidentifiable pieces of meat. 15 mins after this was served, some mint jelly was plonked on our table which we realized was supposed to be served with the lamb in our ‚Äúplatter‚Äù. How can one of these bowls serve 5 adults?

4. Running out of food at 2.30pm. This is inexcusable. If the restaurant wanted to reduce food wastage, then it could have easily requested guests to pre-order their main course. But they didn‚Äôt and instead when a burger was ordered at 2.30pm (so late because our initial starter orders were messed up) we were told there are no more left. Similarly, an order for cinnamon rolls went unserved even though we ordered it before the cut off time. When inquiries were made, we were informed there was nothing left. According to the Manager he ‚ÄúSearched all over the hotel but could not find any‚Äù. Perhaps searching the kitchen would have been more appropriate! Food had run out a full 30 mins before the ‚Äúbuffet‚Äù ended. I say ‚Äúbuffet‚Äù because the very concept of that is the servings are unlimited but for this event, they very much were limited.

5. Charging us for the burger that was not available. When we received the bill, we were surprised to see we had been charged for an additional main course of‚Ä¶ a burger. Initially our table ordered 2 x Angus beef burger however as mentioned they only had enough for one portion, therefore the other was changed to the Steak and Egg. When the bill arrived, we found a charge for 1 additional Angus Beef Burger. After all the issues we had faced, you would expect the manager to at least check our bill before he personally handed it over to us. Why anger an already annoyed customer?

6. The positives: Food tasted great. The balloon sculptor was a nice addition. Ambience was cheerful. Staff were friendly despite the hiccups."

Excellent Service and a Great Team!,"Headed there for a special occasion and was greeted by polite and friendly staff members. Was served by a trio of Horman, Jennifer and Joey who made sure that our glasses were always full, tables were always clear of unnecessary plates and that our dine was extravagant. The food was phenomenal and i‚Äôd love to come back for more!"
Review on restaurant,Staff was friendly and helpful. They are prompt in handling requests. The only downside is their menu got smaller and not too much of a choice to select from until June when the renovations is done and they'll get their new menu.
Good service at Alley on 25,"Went to Alley on 25 for their kitchen party menu. The menu for food is limited. However, the service provided by Shi Ting and Yi Yan is good despite having to miss out some of our food orders"
Andaz Kitchen Party Sizzles My Evening!!,"Still think Alley on 25 is one of the best kept secret for an evening of sensible dinner and drinks away from the madding crowd in the neighbouring areas. Had a lovely time tonight (Thursday, 31.3.2022) enjoying the sample of finger food (crudites, charred shishito pepper, sweet potato fries, tex-mex nachos, fried chicken and free flow red, white wine or house beer and genmeicha soft serve for dessert). Many thanks to Caleb for the prosecco surprise, as well the hospitality team (Le Xuan and Joey) who served us attentively. We wish to express our sincerest compliments to them for their pride in their work and making us feel welcome each time we were there."
Enjoyable place to have dinner,"Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, all of the service staff were excellent even though we had our dinner quite late. The food was good and arrived promptly as well. Joey was really attentive and made us really enjoy our dinner!"
Better service from what we‚Äôve known and expected previously,"I‚Äôve been to this place for a couple of times. But I always get mixed service attitude from the floor staff. But this time round is different when I got serve from Joey and Lai at the restaurant. They were very attentive to our needs and make sure our dining experience is well taken care of.

I would say out of the many times I‚Äôm here. Joey is the most attentive to our table and make sure that we are well taken care of"
