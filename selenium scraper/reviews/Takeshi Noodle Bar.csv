Brilliant innovation on singapore classics,"Food & service were fantastic, delicious interpretation on traditional laksa and savoury spices made for great flavour"
That delightful twist,"I have always been meaning to try the dry laksa as it has received positive reviews. Sure it has a balanced ratio between the vermicelli and the ingredients (and it could be a notch or 2 spicier for that extra kick of depth) but what surprised us was the Kaya Goreng dessert that was so low key but so deserving of flex. That aromatic kaya paired with refined coconut shavings alongside the savory sweet ice cone is simply too delectable. I ordered a second portion being on a caloric count so yeah, try it!"
Good place and will visit again sometime,"I like this cozy restaurant and recommend to everyone. Hospitable hosts, delicious dishes, and local cocktails. I would like to come back here again sometime."
Fantastic and cosy place!,I had dinner and drinks with some of my friends there. Chef Renee's signature dry laksa is surely the dish that cannot be missed! The manager Emery is very friendly and chatty too. I will definitely go there again.
Great Food Great Place Great People,Food here is fantastic! Try out chef specialties…. Too many to list down Friendly and attentive service team! We always had a great time here
Group of 5,Food was great. The service was fast and friendly. We will be back again. The place wasn’t awfully crowded hence the service received was almost like private dining.
Fantastic place,"Went for a dinner and the food and service was amazing. The staff were very polite and attentive.

We had the otah scallops and tau pok for starters. Both were delicious with us giving the edge to the scallops!

Our mains were the dry laksa and the pork ramen. The ramen broth was super comforting! Definitely value for money and I find it better than the ramen chains that you pay the same/slightly more for

The dry laksa was definitely the highlight of the meal. I honestly find it a good compliment with ramen we had! We had it with the prawns and it was a generous serving with plenty of flavour. I was worried I would get jelak after a couple of bites but I thoroughly enjoyed it till the last bite

Definitely would love to go back with a bigger group so we can try the other things!

Highly recommend this place!"
Fantastic food and wonderful service,"Ordered the dry laksa from jelebu dry laksa, chef Renée herself was there to cook the laksa. laksa was flavourful, not too spicy and the tiger prawns were amazing. Love chef Renée's take on laksa. Also ordered garlic fries which were well seasoned and the laksa cocktail which was refreshing with a hint of heat. Service was excellent and staff were really friendly."
Valentine Day,"Came across Takeshi Noodle Bar while trying to find new places for ramen, and was intrigued by their menu, especially the dry laksa. Decided to gave a try and was truly impressed by the roasted iberico pork ramen and aburi salmon linguine. The service provided by both ladies is excellent as they are super attentive. Will definitely patronise again!"
Staff appreciation,"Hi Tipsy Team, Just want to say good job to the excellent service provided by Emery. Always checking on how are we & also prepare a customised cocktails for us to enjoy. Thank you so much, definitely will come back again."
Unexpected Friday Night Experience,I like the dry laksa it has the flavors minus the soupy mess. Place was nice especially for a busy Friday night. Try their local inspired cocktails as well you might like it.
Great company and food.,Nice and friendly staff Emery. She recommended us king cup game and played with us. Strongly recommend for her promotion. We are greatly appreciated. Thank you Emery. :)
Thank you Emery & Team,"Tonight on 10 Dec 2021, I would like to thank Emery and her team for making it a wonderful night for us. We actually had some “hiccups” at another restaurant & chanced upon Takashi noodle on Google.

We arrived after 8.30pm and it’s a Friday, and we only had to wait for a little while (really lucky for a Friday) & thankfully there are seats for my friends & I (yay!)

From the start till the end, Emery & her team made us feel so welcomed and even explained the dishes to us & knowing that this is a birthday celebration for me, she even gave us free shots (look at the pic!!) (sorry Takashi noodle, maybe people might start requesting for it )

Remember to order their mentaiko oysters cause it’s so good & the mentaiko linguine!

We will be back again! Thanks Emery & team for the wonderful night ;)"
5 star food!!,Unique ambience with very friendly people working here! Ordered the collagen ramen and it’s awesome! Rest of the food is extremely nice as well!
good vibes & good food,"ambience is amazing and it is a hidden gem in tanjong pagar, food was at an affordable price and tastes good also! overall pleasant experience:)"
Food,"The staff is very nice and friendly, the food smells nice and taste quite delicious too. The atmosphere is nice too."
Noodle bar,Portion is relatively small but tastes pretty good. Pretty pricey for the portion but worth it. Had the mentaiko salmon pasta.
very good service,the food is awesome. Lyna and Joyce have been a wonderful crew. They made the environment so enjoyable. Will be back soon!
EXCELLENT SERVICE & FOOD,Takeshi Noodle Bar have the most amazing menu. Service staff Lyna are very polite and approachable. Ambience of the restaurant is perfect! Definitely a nice place to unwind after a long day.
"good vibes, cool noodle items :)","the place has a good vibe :) and they have interesting noodle choices, I liked that we could choose the firmness of the noodles. my friend and I chose the hard for the firmness, however, we felt the noodles was a little starchy, and had a flour taste to it. you could try ordering the soft firmness for the noodles. overall a pleasant visit!"
Great food great ambience!,"Food taste great and service was great too! Especially the ramen, the truffle smell and taste was excellent"
Great food and quiet ambience,Really yummy food and quiet place. Attentive and friendly staff! Recommend the edamame and the uni pasta.
Draw to the good reviews for Ramen here,"Quiet location and cozy setting. Interesting decor mixed with bar setting. Friendly staff welcoming you. Tried the pork ramen, nicely cook and warmly served."
Friendly staff / Good food,Went to Takeshi for lunch and the food is wonderful. service is great. Very friendly and kind staff. Ambience is great
Huang,Ramen is nicely cooked. Good variety of choices in the menu. Service staff was friendly. But it is slightly pricey.
Interesting food and ambience,"Great service and great food, highly recommend their wagyu ramen. Thick broth! Goes pretty well with the Asahi Black"
Great food and ambience!,Their Mala Wonton noodles are good... Awesome service and nice ambience! Highly recommend for all who seek a good lunch or dinner!
Noodles but better,"Great ambience, great service and great food. Would recommend if you're looking for a little smth different when having a noodle dish."

Will definitely come back!,"This place is very decorative. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Food is really nice. Great ambience, food, and service!"
Worth trying,"Chic interior decor accompanied with delicious and well-presented food . Great drinks selection, got the one for one deal . Value for money ! Highly recommend to try the mentaiko salmon pasta and mala ramen"
Unique flavors of ramen,"Second time coming to this noodle bar. This time they have alot more selection of ramen. Tried their seafood mala ramen and truffle wagyu beef noodle. The mala broth is nice, not very spicy but can be quite numbing on the tongue if u eat more. Truffle infused tonkatsu broth is nice, not too overpowering and still can taste the tonkatsu base. Would prefer the noodle to be more springy, otherwise everything is good! Joyce is also very helpful and friendly!"
Awesome noodles in a pretty place,The noodles here are delicious and every bite is a delight. Personally recommend the Mala lobster wanton mee!
"Chill ambience, food subpar","Ambience is cute and cozy but food was subpar. Collagen uni ramen noodle texture was mushy and seafood not too fresh, was not value for money. Garlic fries was good though"
Dinner,"Very friendly and attentive staff. Nice plating. Reasonably restaurant price. Not over expensive and definitely not hawker price. Food wise, to be honest, is not to my liking. Oyster is good. Striploin is so-so. Truffle linguine is rich and creamy but a little too creamy for me. Their signature ramen has a lot of quality ingredients but it does not have a harmonious taste together. Soup is thick but have a foreign taste. The soup already has a think flavour yet there is fried garlic slices inside which makes it very strong taste. The garlic overpowered the soup. Its a pity that lots of seafood are served buy turns out the broth is not to my liking.
Only the good service may make me revisit this restaurant and I will at most order their sides. The mains in this restaurant is disappointing."
Worth the trip!,Good ambience and friendly staff! I have ordered seafood mala collagen and its not too spicy! I loved the fujifilm photos on the wall!
Quiet environment and nice staffs,"Love the food we ordered today! Very interesting flavours especially the mala lobster wonton, and the environment is very cosy and absolutely love their tableware. Would come again sometime soon!"
A gem in Keong Siak.,"Excellent service, great fusion ramen at reasonable prices. Love the seafood mala. Not too spicy and rather flavourful."
Great Vibes,Great for dates rich uni pasta! Oysters were fresh. Didn't manage to try the drinks but its a great place with nice vibes for dates
Review,The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere and the food is great. The price is reasonable and i would highly recommend my friends and family.
Nice food,"Good food good service, recommend to come again. Good ambience, a nice place to gather with friends."

SPICHEEEATZZ WAS HERE,"The uni butter noodles were succulent and scrumptious. With a modest portion and with a pleasant ambience. It was a good dining experience. Will come here again. If you’re here for the garlic fries, we were too. If you sit at the back it might be a bit warm. But it’s been a really good experience and will come here again! Your lucky if you get Joyce she’s such a kind soul!"
Yumz!!,"We ordered the Mentaiko Linguine and Honey Iberico Pork Ramen!!
The Pork Ramen was pretty good, noodles were cooked to perfection, pork was decadant.
Linguine was al dente, was not jelak at all!! Satisfies my cravings as a mentaiko lover!
Service was really good as well and the staff were very attentive to our needs! Overall would come back again :)"

Nice ambience and good food!,The mala seafood collagen ramen is good but not enough mala in my opinion. The honey iberico pork ramen is tasty! Wait is a little too long though - waited 45 min for our noodles..
Lovely interior,Lovely interior and lovely food! Great alternative to the conventional ramen found elsewhere in town. ˆᴗˆhighly recommended to locals and travelers alike.

a dinner fit for the gods,"Let me tell your guys, this might be the best meal i have had in MY WHOLE LIFE OK. came across this restaurant on instagram and was so intrigue w the menu items i had to come here for my dinner on the same day. Takeshi took me on a ride i must say, first i was served the mentaiko oysters and i was like ""hmm this is alright."" then the mains was served and i literally FLOATED UP TO THE MOON OK. i ordered the uni pasta and my partner ordered the chu collagen ramen. AND WE WERE BOTH HAVING A SHOKUGEKI MOMENT. IM NOT GOING TO LIE. it was so good.... i don't normally finish my meals, especially noodle meals but this....... i devoured. omg. Takeshi my man, i don't know who u are but u my friend is the jesus of fusion food. thank u for letting me experience this. i was on the verge of tears when my bowl was finishing.

I'll definitely be back, literally my favourite dinner yet!!!!

and i just realize how melodramatic this whole review is but IT IS THAT GOOD YALL.

peace out i'm crying that my bowl is finished"
Noodle,we had the pork ibero ramen and the angel hair lobster. The ramen soup was delicious and the dry angel hair was exquisite. The meals were reasonably priced and the staff were patient and friendly. Will definitely pay another visit

Anniversary lunch,Came here for anniversary lunch. The broth was favourful and there is a good variety of food. Service was good and fast.

Mmm noodles,"Gud pm every1.... Came across this unique establishment from the recommedation of my lovely grand daughter. MUST TRY 👍👍👍👍 Cheers, Mr Yam. Good day to all."
Great seafood mala ramen,The atmosphere is great. A bit pricey but worth it. Loved the seafood mala ramen. Very rich and spicy.
Great Place,"Sick Ambiance, but they should have a bigger sign outside. Great food with a nice fusion twist of ramen"
Great ramen,"Loved the ramen! The atmosphere is fantastic too since it's in a hotel, but make sure you can find the place. The alcohol is also great."

very awesome delicous,"the food is very enticing interior is beautiful
walking down the street with my friends gave a really nice vibe. had the mala ramen and it tasted absolutely bangin. 10/10 would recommend for any bloke looking for a easy dinner date. Afterwards one may feel free to book a hotel room
upstairs"
Lovely Noodles,"First experience here was great! Super delectable, aromatic noodles with amazing ambience! So excited to come back for more!"
Excellent ambience even better food!,"Hidden in the corner of Teck Lim the restaurant did not look anything special from the outside but once we stepped in we were greeted with a warm yet vibrant interior and friendly staff. The food looked so good on the menu that it took us almost 15-20mins to decide on what to order. When the food arrived it did not disappoint. The Seafood Dashi Aglio Olio was very tasty and the pasta springy, the Honey Roasted Iberico Tonkotu was full of flavour and value for money. They also had a few really attractive promotions with free fries and 1:1 drinks which made the entire meal really affordable. I will definitely be back to try their other offerings."
Awesome,Good service & . good ambience… Good noodles… Recommended… Give it a try … Good place for friends & family
Good service,Service is prompt and greeted us with water. Unique customisation in the ramen where we are asked the firmness of noodles and richness of soup.
Great ambiance and food,Went here on a sunday and it wasnt too busy. Food came quickly and was good. Staff were helpful and the drinks were well made too.
Artsy noodle bar with amazing food,"Be sure to eat here when you are in the area! Try their honey roasted ibérico pork ramen, highly recommended!"
"Nice ambience, delicious ramen","Hidden on a quiet street lies this ramen place, situated within Soloha hotel. Parking lots are very limited but we came at an off peak timing and managed to find a lot.

The ambience is fantastic, simple but nice deco. The place was quiet maybe because we were the only ones there.

We ordered the honey roasted iberico pork ramen. You can choose the softness of the noodles and the richness of the soup. The ramen was much to our liking. The soup was rich in flavour but not overwhelming that makes you thirsty while the noodles texture was perfect. The iberico pork was succulent except it could be a little tough at certain parts where it was slightly overcooked.

We also ordered the salmon mentaiko. The salmon was cooked well but was not dry. Paired with the mentaiko sauce, it was a delicacy. You probably can't go wrong with mentaiko sauce.

A nice place to dine with lovely ambience and good food."
Great ramen and sides in Chinatown,Visited for the 2nd time and the food and service were just as good. Highly recommended to try the Karage with wasabi mayo!
Great Ramen place tucked inside a cosy boutique hotel,"Both Ramen we chose were beautifully presented with the all important Ajitama ( Ramen Egg) done nicely. The inside of the egg was still soft and runny.

Wagyu A5 Ramen Tonkotsu

Smooth thin slice of A5 Wagyu melts in your mouth

Truffle oil sets the soup stock apart from the other Ramen

Honey Iberico Char Siew Ramen

Soft Tasty honey char siew

Thick hearty stock

Thanks for the complimentary Garlic Fries!"
Beautiful!,Very lovely ambience with wonderful friendly staff. Everything looked so good on the menu.. Recommended!!
First visit here,The ambience of this place is really cute!! very good for outings with friends or celebrations! it has a slight pink theme to the place as well!
Rly good place!,The ingredients were rly fresh and the food wasn’t too salty yet flavourful. The yuzu peach was super refreshing and not too sweet and the environment is super good for birthday/dates The photos don’t do justice to how good to food is tho
Great meal in city,Pretty and comfortable environment. Friendly and knowledgeable staff that could articulate the menu choices well. Awesome food. Great location in the city.
A Hidden Gem,"A pleasant surprise to find out that Hotel Soloha has a collaboration with Takeshi Noodle Bar. We had Chu-Ni Broth ramen with Truffle Mentaiko Linguine, both exceeded our expectations. Would come again just for the cozy yet refined dining experiencing. The mentaiko oyster though pricy was definitely worth it. It is comparable to that of The Sushi Bar at Far East Plaza."
