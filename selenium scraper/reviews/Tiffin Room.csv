Starting a new year right,"It was just wonderful to be able to go back to Raffles Hotel and have dinner once again at the Tiffin Room restaurant.
There have been changes made to the restaurant, which was to be expected as there have been changes to Raffles hotel entirely.
We arrived in time for our dinner table and were warmly greeted and informed the table needed to be free by 8:45 pm
The furnishings and furniture had been changed, and one thing that was missing were the tables that used to have all the wonderful curry options etc available. Instead was a long table with bottles of wine and glasses place on a perfectly white linen cloth.
We were shown to our table and there were hats for gentlemen and tiaras for the ladies and little things that you would use to see the new year in.
The menu was quite detailed and we chose our own appetisers and main choices. I very much appreciated that we were able to have a pause between the courses, thank you.
The food was delicious, the wine perfectly cold and water was replenished if required.
It was our 30th anniversary together and there was a small desert from the kitchen.
Thank you for making this evening wonderful and memorable.
Hope to see you again."
An experience,"Located in the Raffles Hotel complex, The Tiffin Room oozes that old colonial vibe.

From the staff uniforms to the decor and ambiance, this is certainly a venue that impresses even before you have eaten.

Service was good, the food was good and yes it was expensive (but that's just a Singapore thing) however I had a really pleasant evening and am glad I went. Yes I could get a better curry for less money elsewhere in the city but this is one of those places that is more than the sum of it's parts thus you go for The Experience and not just the food"
"Average food at best, worth one visit for the ambience but would not visit again","The food was average, at best. You would pay good money for the ambience, but not so much for the food itself. Several other more affordable Indian food establishments in Singapore serve much better and more authentic tasting indian food. The food might appeal to the non indian palate perhaps and maybe the food is intentionally made to be bland to cater to wide ranging preferences.

Service was average, too few servers to cater to the weekend crowd. Took some time to catch their attention for service. Otherwise, the servers were friendly.

The seating, table arrangement, crockery, etc was not worthy of a fine dining establishment. No place mats and no spoons provided initially for the food. Had to ask for it. No bowls provided for the main dish curries either."
Great dining experience,"Everything about our dinner was fantastic, the ambience, the service and the food, a very enjoyable evening. The waiters were very attentive and efficient, each dish had an amazing taste, ."
Excellent food,Classic Indian food at the Tiffin Room. Absolutely beautiful setting in the Raffles hotel. Very classy. Must go if you are in Singapore. Friendly staff and excellent service.
"The days of British quirkiness are gone, shame.","We are long time visitors to Raffles and are pleased to have finally seen the latest incarnation.
The Tiffin has always been a favourite although it has changed substantially.
The renovations are thorough but sadly some of the old character is gone.
This is now a smart restaurant with decent Indian food but the food is like the decor.
The place needs to regain its soul.
The restaurant does not particularly feel part of Raffles as it used to.
Those who visit for the first time will appreciate it as is now."
Beautiful setting but disappointed in lack of warmth of service,"Lovely setting in the iconic Raffles hotel. Had booked on line and had noted we were celebrating my sisters birthday. Sadly no reference was made to that during the visit. Service was brisk and efficient but I found very cold and almost sterile. We all opted for the mera dabba ( tiffin boxes ). Food was delicious and we all enjoyed our meal. For a £300 lunch for four was slightly disappointed in our experience.
We had had a meal in little India which we all agreed we enjoyed more!"
Classy experience,"A lovely Sunday lunch experience amidst colonial styled architecture themed restaurant. Its a composed place and one can enjoy the food while engaging in a conversation. Food was fantastic, service good too. Ideal for celebrating special occasions."
Tiffin Room is a wonderful Indian restaurant. Dolce Vita is a desultory restaurant pretending to offer Italian cuisine..,"Last week my wife and I were in Singapore. Two of our dining experiences were at the Tiffin Room in the Raffles Hotel and Dolce Vita in the Mandarin Oriental. My goodness, what a difference! Both are said to be well-regarded but whilst the Tiffin Room was outstanding in both the quality of the food and its service, Dolce Vita's food was unsatisfactory. In fact, the cooking there could be described as borderline amateurish. For example, we have eaten Vitello Tonnato all over the world and love it. However, rather than the delicate thinly sliced veal with a touch of tuna sauce we have had elsewhere, we received thick pieces of veal heavily laden with a sauce that had the consistency of peanut butter. Frankly, it was terrible. The main courses were little better. The seafood was reasonable but otherwise unremarkable and the pasta was barely acceptable. Unfortunately, al dente is not in the chef's vocabulary.
On the other hand, the food at the Tiffin Room was authentic, beautifully prepared and delicious. We shared several dishes accompanied by naan bread and condiments all of which were excellent.
The meals including wine at both restaurants were about the same price so if you like both Indian and Italian food, the Tiffin Room is certainly superior."
Delicious Indian in an iconic setting,Fabulous food - delicious with a great choice. Fabulous setting and service of a very high standard.
A beautiful piece of Singapore's culinary scene,"Again another nice evening at Singapore's iconic Raffles Hotel. Food as ever, perfect in presentation and quality of Northern Indian recipes and delicate flavours. Ask for the tasting menu which also includes a vegetarian option and is good value for money. The interior is lovely, serves every taste for refined dining without being snobby. Like to compliment the quality of the service which they manage to keep up despite the staff problems the industry faces at the moment. It was perfect - a real great experience."
"Great ambience, below average food","Small restaurant, so reserving is recommended. Had to provide my credit card details for reservation. The no show fees was $50 per head.
This review is totally not related to the price. It is pricey, but this is in Raffles Hotel and that's not lost on me.
The Non Veg Kebab taster platter was good but the portions were small. The Lucknowi Chicken Biryani was total injustice to the dish. It was neither fragrant nor spicy. Can get better Biryani at Mr. Biryani in Serangoon and 1/3th price.
The Murgh teeka masala was definitely not Teeka (spicy). Probably the spices were toned down to the level of the Western guests, in whose celebration the Raffles Hotel is styled.
The Service was good, though the waitress was unable to suggest a good mixture for my Amrut Whiskey, as she didnt drink Whiskey. For a 2-3 star hotel, thats acceptable, but for a 5 star restaurant I would have expected her to consult the Spirits incharge."
Best Indian food ever and the most luxurious room ever.,Wow. Exquisite room. Luxurious. Service was above all expectations. The food was totally the best Indian food I have ever eaten. For the service and atmosphere and quality of food the price is great value. We even had a bottle of Indian Chardonnay. It was excellent ($88). We started the evening with a pre dinner drink of a Singapore Sling at the famous Long Bar.
Breakfast as an art form,Our pre booked breakfast was a great saving on the walk in price which is very expensive but you can ask for as many courses as you wish
Lovely dining room,"Located in the lobby of the main wing of the iconic Raffles Hotel, this is their all-day dining room that serves seasonal themed high teas too. For breakfast, opt to dine outdoors by the lovely fountain if the weather permits."
Fabulous,"We turned up after 12 hours of travelling and airport experiences to be greeted by fabulously friendly staff, which relaxed us immediately.

The menu was wonderful - we chose spinach with chickpea and potato as entree. Be careful as the sizes of entrees are big.

For main we had lentil dahl, Murgh tikka masala, rice and a tandoori roti. All spectacular and I particularly loved the fact that the curry had a nice chilli bite to it and wasn’t designed for western tastes.

Can’t wait to go back, terrific find on the first night in Singapore"
The Tiffin Room,"The Tiffin Room was an incredible experience. We were celebrating my parents 19th wedding anniversary, my father and I’s birthday and Christmas, as we had been split up for a while. The waiters were friendly and productive, and are a definite reason on why we are coming back here soon. The food was impeccable. The Butter Chicken and Lamb Rogan Josh were flavoursome and rich, the naan bread was soft and buttery, and the mango icecream and chocolate cake were sweet and delightful. Although it is expensive as this restaurant is situated in The Raffles Hotel, it is definitely worth the time and money for special occasions. A total 5/5."
Stunning setting that draws a crowd that the staff is not prepared for,We went for the Holi experience and it was okay. The food was tasty and as spicy as traditional Indian fare should be. The setting is absolutely stunning which is great as we spent loads of time waiting for food and gave up and went and got our own water off the drink cart. Our weekday lunch took over 2 hours.....
Family time in Tiffin,"Tiffin have a special place in my heart. I was there last year with my partner and we enjoyed it so much. This year, we continued the tradition by bringing my partner's family and my mother-in-law was so impressed. Jefferson made my family feel comfortable and they trusted him with his recommendations. Everybody left with a hally tummy and I'm very sure they will not forget this dining experience"
Fabulous Indian fare served in relaxed style!,"Have heard much of Tiffin Room but got to try it just this morning on the Chinese New Year break. Mighty impressed by the whole decor, pleasant ambience and pleasing manners of the helpful staff. We tried for Starters Palak Chat & Paneer Tikka. Both mouthwatering! For the main course we tried Dal Makhani, Paneer Butter Masala & Gobi Mutter. We tried a variety of Naans- Pudina Laccha Paratha, Garlic Naan & Onion Kulcha. All items were authentic and tasty without being too heavy. For dessert we tried Poha Rabadi. The whole experience was delightful and it was nice to see the place buzzing with activity after all that the COVID has done to us all! Particularly impressed was my wife, an artist herself, by the entire get up- the chandeliers, the tiffin boxes on display and the table arrangement so pleasing to the eye!"
We went for Rajasthani Experience and we’re HUGELY disappointed with the food.,"Experience for Rajasthani Experience was Total disappointment. The server told us not to expect authentic as it is “not authentic authentic”.
All items on Menu were below average taste. I can find better food than this at any Serangoon restaurant.
Chef Negi did a disservice to the food or the customer.
I don’t think I can I would ever revisit Tiffin Room.
Tinde ki Subzi had full deep Fried Tinda; gatta pulao was very dry; Dal Batti Churna was basically a Matar Kachori served with Dal with no Churma.
Kheer was not sweete."
"Generally excellent. Beautiful dining room, exceptional service and the food was refined and tasty.",Clearly a restaurant for special occasions as the dining room is fabulous. We dine at lots of Indian restaurants from cafes through to fine dining and this is on a par with the best of them. Delicious ingredients - maybe the chicken could have had a bit more smoke to it - but that is a niggle. The service was exceptional -would highly recommend. Portions are generous. Clearly lots of attention to the detail here.
Average Experience,"The lunch at the famous Tiffin room was an average dining experience. I had heard a lot about this place but to be honest I was quite surprised by the overall experience - both food and service was very average for me. The decor and the fact that you are dining in such an iconic place gives it a good vibe for me. The menu is simple and has a lot of interesting sounding dishes. The service staff seemed a bit lost as we had to constantly raise our hands to get some attention. I had to ask for water twice, which one expects should be refilled without asking. Appetizers were okay, the mushroom in the veg platter was pungent. The Raan in the meat platter was smelly. The tandoori prawn was delicious. The daal was okay. The murg chicken was average and lacked any flavour. The mixed vegetables were avoidable. The paneer kulcha was nice and so was the pudina paratha. In the desert, the chocolate gulab jamun’s were delicious and so was the ras malai. Mango kulfi was okay. Overall a very average dining experience. Doubt we’ll dine here again though. I might want to try the hi-tea next door though."
Memorable moments created at Tiffin Room with my Parents!,"We dined in Tiffin Room on 11th December. My parents and I were so welcomed by our Raffles hotel ambassador at the lobby. The moment we entered Tiffin room we were so amazed by the hospitality! Tiffin Ambassador Nayan, Jeffson , Micheal, Sram and Chef Kuldeep welcomed us with warm heart! We ordered Mera Dappa! How is it possible not to order that when we are at Tiffin!! The presentation of food were amazing!!!! The taste of the food didn’t change. It were still perfectly good!!!! The masala chai is die hard to have for!!!! I can just go on how we felt as it was amazing!!!!!!! If you drop by Raffles hotel pls visit Tiffin Room!!! Trust me you won’t regret!!! I had memorable moments with my parents and we took a family photo at the legendary Christmas tree!!! Thank you for the warm hospitality and perfectly amazing food!!!!!

Extra extra stars for Tiffin Ambassadors!!!!! You guys deserve recognition!!!!!!"
Indian food at Raffles,"Good ambience, above average, but not as compared to the new restaurant in other hotels.

I do not know much about Indian food and it looks like it needs lot of preparation, so to me it was nice and I would rate it as a high 4 perhaps."
Delightful Dinner,"I am of no capacity to judge if they serve the best / authentic North Indian cuisine in Singapore, but they were sufficiently tasty for me (except for the naans, would be nicer with a lil more flavor to them) and did not scrooge on the quantity. Top it up with good ambience, it was a delightful experience.

Service by Nayan was great, she thoughtfully brought us yoghurt to relief us from the spiciness of the curries. However, service in general can be improved further with more warmth from the colleagues."
Impressive breakfast!,We were delighted with the extensive breakfast that were provided with our memorable stay at Raffles!
Great Ambiance with Good Authentic Food !,Great Ambience and Good Authentic Food ! Nice for a relaxed evening meal with Friends and family or for lunch !
Tiffin room never fail to impress,"I had a memorable experience here. First time here . Visited on a Thursday but still packed. Well visited place for its Very good service, delightful food at reasonable price and superb ambiance. Recommend the organic black lentils and other vegetarian dishes too. All too good. Surely will come back over and over again. Love it"
Best Indian Cuisine,The best North Indian cuisine in Singapore bar none. The dishes exquisitely prepared and sumptuously presented. The staff is knowledgeable with each dish on the menu and offer the best suggestions to meet a guest’s palate and criteria. In the heart of La Grande Dame - Raffles Hotel. Tiffin truly marries the standards of the East Asian culinary world with the mission statement and what one expects from La Grande Dame. The ambience is immaculate and the fair extraordinary lending to a marvellous experience with one of the most hospitable and pleasant staff you can find. If you desire Indian cuisine then look no further than the Tiffin Room. A hidden gem and a best kept secret until now.
Family Dinner,"We decided to check out Tiffin Room as we had been to the Osteria BBR by Alain Ducasse restaurant before and the menu looked appetising. I'm not sure if it's because of the Covid restrictions, their menu selection is not very extensive. But the tiger prawn appetiser was my favourite as the spices, mixed into a plate of steaming hot basmati rice, was simply delicious. Lovely decor adds to the ambiance, nice venue for date nights, family dinners or even business meetings."
wonderful staffs & great dining experience,"If you love indian flavours, Tiffin Room offers an amazing dishes. My favourite was the palak chaat & butter chicken with naan! Too delicious.

Wine pairing together with the food was good!

Amazing & professional staffs with exceptional service. All off them! So much attentive. Felt very welcomed.

Had a great dining experience with my friends. Nice ambience too!"
Substandard! What’s the hype about?,"Substandard! What’s the hype about?

We went there tonight for a dinner for 3 ( 2 adults & 1 kid). The service was substandard to say the least. I’m not sure if the crew already feels privileged to be working at Raffles hotel or they are trained to be that way. None had a pleasant way when they approached. This wasn’t just our table but across.

The food is completely substandard and nothing special of North Indian cuisine. There are much better places for the authentic North Indian cuisine and its definitely not Tiffin Room.

Yes, if you want to enjoy the feel of being in Raffles Hotel, do sit for a nice time that too if the staff lets you have so."
kohinoor of indian food and superb service by Nayan,it is inside the raffles hotel and outstanding North Indian food. Nayan is very helpful and always smiling. visited twice for my own birthday and a friends wife. kachori raj is outstanding a must. papdi chaat and corn fritters very disappointing. In starters have to have raj kachori. the mixed veg is out of the world in the main course. matter aloo yellow dhal are superb. only disappointing was palak paneer. Sweets Rasmalai is outstanding and also chocolate jamun. however rabbi poha was below average. mango kulfi is just nice. gajar halwa surely needs improvement. the staff is very helpful. also if you are Accor plus member 20 percent off. they have set menu also veg for 65 dollars plus plus. One more thing retain the bill as if you valet parking they need to see the bill otherwise 30 dollars charge. Thanks to nayan we had a great time and outstanding food and ambience. It is by far the best Indian food I have had in Singapore. Must visit.
Perfection personified,"Located in the beautiful Raffles hotel the Tiffin room has to be the most exquisite Indian on the planet. The restaurant is delightful, the food exceptional and the staff, in particular Nayan, Jefferson and Michelle (who keeps the wine flowing), are wonderful. Always made to feel welcome and always leave looking forward to the next visit."
Very very slow service,"I know I could same the same about every restaurant in Singapore, but I really expected better at Raffles, and therefore so much more disappointed. When we visited it wasn't that busy, it still took 30 mins to receive the wine I ordered, despite asking 2 times. Very poor service"
"Nice food, lovely interiors but too crowded seating","The food was great, ambience is elegant, service was decent but too many tables so can be very noisy on a weekend. We ordered the fish tikka, chicken biryani (yumm!), sev chat (yum!), chicken tikka (nice) and mixed veg curry (nice), mango kulfi (ok), ras malai (nice)."
Anniversary Dinner ❤,"We had dinner to celebrate our wedding anniversary and twas a lovely atmosphere. Service was excellent. Jefferson (one of the staffs) was very detailed in introducing the menu and made such good recommendations. The portion was quite big and i would say its good for sharing for 2. We ordered lamb roganjosh and chicken tikka masala for mains and they served free-flow of naan. It was indeed a good North Indian cuisine experience.

I also loved the deco with all the tiffins ❤"
Pricey but well worth it.,"Dropped by this place during lunch since my partner was dying to try out this restaurant.

We tried the barramundi,chicken briyani and naan. It was so delicious that we managed to finish up everything and even ordered more of the naan.

We are no experts of Indian cuisine but the taste of each dish was spectacular. Coupled with the great ambience of the restaurant,we really enjoyed ourselves there.

I highly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion"
Presentation and looks beat flavour,"Elegant dining room with great service. The menu has interesting and unusual dishes, especially among street food and appetiser offerings, but the flavour is extremely mild, too tuned down for western palates."
WHAT A FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE FOR A FIRST TIME VISIT TO TIFFIN ROOM,"I visited Raffles hotel and TIFFIN ROOM for the first time and what an excellent experience. Occasion was celebrating birthday and a kind gesture by the hotel to give us a surprise desert with a birthday candle truly touched our hearts. This was totally unexpected and marks a clear difference between a 5 star experience and rest as they made us feel special.

We left satisfied - the ambience has a royal feel and the food was excellent with a fantastic service. Dal makhani was one of the best i have had till now and the gulab jamun had a twist as it had a choclate filling - different from the one we normally have. Thanks a lot Chef Kuldeep for making dining an amazing experience.

We are definitely coming back in 2021 :-) . Keep up the good work !!"
A Currylicious Christmas!,"It started with a great view - a McLaren parked out the front of Raffles (!!) and soon after, great service welcomed us to the Tiffin Room. Passing the temperature test, we were quickly whisked away to an intimate table of 5. An offer of champagne was promptly made, but I reminded the waiter that celebrations may have to wait until after we could travel again. My fellow guests thought I went hard on the starters, but in actual fact, they ate everything so it seems the food made up for my lack of judgment. The must haves: Katchori & Papdi Chaat!! Phenomenal. The Jhinga prawns are nice, but the Paneer was decidedly average and doesn't even deserve to be left in the boot of the McLaren. Chocolate Gulab Jamuns are great if you're willing to add an extra inch to your thighs for a week (which I did). All in all, a big fan of Tiffin Room and been there 3 times in 1 month. That says it all. Oh and btw, Nayan's a star, or Bunny as they cutely call her!"
Amazing Service & Delicious Food with gluten free & vegetarian options!,"BEST Indian Restaurant in Singapore by far!!! Service is excellent - Nayan in particular is friendly, attentive and helpful. Kudos to chef Kuldeep Negi for dreaming up delicious gluten free options and his gluten free chickpea naan is to die for! The only Indian restaurant I have been to so far with a gluten free naan option. Had a wonderful New Year’s Eve lunch here today."
Not worth the price,"I visited the place in December to celebrate my birthday and found it to be below my expectations:

- I had to ask the waiter three times to get me a wet towel
- The Paneer Butter Masala lacked flavour and was below average. I’ve had much better in places like Curry Culture / 79 After Dark at significantly cheaper prices
- The drink I ordered (Papaya Panna) tasted of stale papaya

All in all, a dissappointing experience and don’t think I’ll be going back here again."
Wonderful,"Dinner in the Tiffin Room does not disappoint. The Indian themed food is top class. Served in copper style Tiffin boxes the drama of serving is enhanced. The decor is lovely and the room is quiet, so that conversations across the table can be heard. The staff are helpful and discreet. Our second visit and certainly not our last."
Best Indian Food in Singapore,"After planning for a long time, finally, we were able to make it. And it didn’t disappoint and lived fully up to the expectations.

The moment we entered we could feel the classy touch of the place and it’s great. The decor is top notch and loved the way they had placed Tiffins from different regions across the place. Does justice to the place in a good way.

Coming to the food we ordered “Paneer Angara Tikka” for starters along with wine. I was amused, I have never tasted paneer (cottage cheese) do delicate and soft at the same time. It was so good and fresh.

Later for the main course, we ordered “Zarda Subz Biryani” and the aroma it let out as it was placed in front of us, was so blissful and calming at the same time. It came with chef compliments of Raita, and Peanut Chutney which blended perfectly with the Biryani.

For dessert we ordered Mango Kulfi, it was accompanied with actual mango pieces. I would say it was average.

Overall it was a great experience and worth visiting again."
"Great food, impeccable Service- Mask could not hide their Smiling Eyes.","Mask could not hide their Smiling Eyes.

Went for Dinner on my Daughters Birthday. Being a Vegetarian, i found the Menu is very well thought off and had a good spread.

The Chats and starters very simply superb. The Panner Tikka was melting and probably the best I have ever had, so far.

Tomato Shorba, was just right. Dhaal Makhni was superb.

This is a place to go for if you have want to taste Indian flavors, at its authentic best, in Singapore.

Thanks for making our Dinner great and stay safe / healthy."
Amazing Indian food and great service,"Went to the Tiffin room for my birthday dinner. The service is clearly one of the strong points from the greeting at the door and throughout the meal service the staff makes you feel welcome and at home.
The food was absolutely delicious. We opted to go with the tiffin box (1 box is good for 2 pax) with tandoori chicken and curry prawns which comes with rice, dhal and naan bread. The quality of the food is excellent and the price for the amount of food you are getting is quite reasonable.
As it was my birthday the staff surprised me with an Indian dessert as well.
We will definitely come back!"
Beautiful Place,"We love everything about Raffles Hotel and the Tiffin room gives a wonderful all round experience to this beautiful historic setting.
The service here has always been great, we usually come for the Tiffin Meal but came this time for their collaboration meal with Thevar Indian restaurant. The menu was exceptional, perfectly balanced flavours, quantities and a wide range of Indian flavours. The cold coconut fish starter was beautiful on a balmy, tropical evening. Definitely transported us to some exquisite, palatial Indian destination. Great value set dinner so check it out for the next few days, loved the balance between the new collaboration dishes and the classic Tiffin set. Thanks very much for our anniversary/birthday dessert. Recommend the Indian gin as a crisp, ice cold pre-dinner drink."
Top-notch experience,"We went to the Tiffin Room for lunch for my husband’s birthday. With precise attention to detail, perfect execution and exceptional service, it was a top-notch experience ! Being located inside the Raffles Hotel adds to the atmosphere, it is exceptional.
I would recommend the Dahi Nariyal Kebab : yogurt kebab with fresh coconut and sandalwood powder, cucumber salad, as a vegetarian appetiser. Perfect balance ; a little tangy, spicy and soft and creamy inside.
A must do !"
Fantastic Indian dinner,"We went to the Tiffin Room for my husband’s birthday and did not regret our choice. The food was spectacular with the right blend of flavors and (not too much!) spice. Honestly everything we ordered was outstanding, but the best dish in my opinion was the vegetable biryani with its subtle fragrance of cardamom. Try also the mixed appetizer (tiger prawn, lamb, chicken). We paired our meal with a delicious Riesling, and enjoyed the beauty of The Raffles. A perfect Singapore experience!"
Dining in Maharaja Style!,"Entering the Raffles Hotel in Singapore feels like stepping into the splendor of a bygone era. Tiffin Room is a fine dining North Indian restaurant which serves exquisitely prepared dishes suitable for all palates! Not for the intrepid diners who are looking for the extremely hot and spicy Indian cuisines. The Non-Veg Maharaja Kebab Tasting Platter consists of boneless chicken cooked in cream cheese, shredded lamb cooked in rum & chutney, and a king prawn grilled with cardamom and mango salsa. For veg main courses, we had roasted aubergine cooked with cumin & chickpeas and cauliflower & green peas cooked in yoghurt & masala gravy. The meat dish was lamb shank with Kashmiri spices. Desserts included carrot pudding and mango ice-cream. Total bill including a bottle of wine was S$387 (oof for 2 pp)."
A good dinner but a bad breakfast,"Visited Tiffin room twice during my stay at Raffles. First was for a birthday dinner at Tiffin Room and I must say, the food served during dinner was excellent and exceeded our expectations. The Palak Paneer and Butter Chicken was superb. The naan if I have to be frank, needs improvement. I've honestly had better back in Sydney... yes, Australia does better naan and it was so similar to what is served in India. Tiffin Room's naan was very underwhelming but the main dishes were excellent in my opinion.

Now to the bad part, breakfast at Tiffin Room was VERY underwhelming. Yes, our rate includes breakfast but I can't imagine paying $72++ for the selection of food. The menu is reduced drastically and quality of food was subpar. The only highlight was the delicious Mee Goreng. Other than that, the egg orders were sent wrong and service was alright. A drastic difference from dinner in my opinion.

My second breakfast, thankfully much better as I decided to have it in my suite and the food was excellent through room service. Overall, I would definitely recommend others to order breakfast to your suite instead.

Tiffin room is the place to have lunch/dinner.... but their breakfast selection leaves alot to be desired."
Limited Breakfast Choice,"There are limited breakfast on the menu and no changes to the menu on a daily basis. Service is inconsistent, but the food is good."
"Very average tea time, extremely disappointed....","I went yesterday to Tiffin room for a tea time and it was such a disappointment... I don't know where to start....
I went there full of excitement and with high expectation as this hotel tea time was the one I most anticipated in Singapore. I thought it would be similar to what I am used to in Paris with my top 3, le Meurice, piazza Athénée and the Ritz Carlon, what a disappointment... its lower than the Fullerton in food quality and service.
Let's start by the bright points, the building is magnificent and the Tiffin decoration is truly beautiful and comfy, the timeless chic decoration is really wonderful.
Now the not good part, this is supposed to be the best hotel in Singapore so I expected flawless service and quality and I ended up very frustrated :
- ordered the blue tea as it seemed the most original, tea quality was bad (tasted like a bad black tea) and hot water was never proposed to refill I had to ask for it - never happens in a good palace in Paris...
- the savoury part was just sandwiches with different filling, not bad but not creative at all...
- the sweet part was a mix of classics scones and small mignardises, the scones were almost cold and very stuffy, the mignardises over sweet except the pale tart that I really enjoyed- I didn't finish any of the mini pastries except for the apple tart
- last but not least the service - it wasn't rude but not attentive at all! I had to ask for a plate change between savoury and sweet, some waiters pass without looking at you or even avoiding looking at your table... I was with 2 girl friends and one of then inadvertently did spread pieces of her scone on the table, no one cleaned even when they came to bring water after we asked, this is really really shocking.
I have a reservation in the hotel for a staycation in October and I am feeling a bit nervous about being there for this tea time experience, definitely not what I expected from this historical hotel..."
Wonderful food and TOP notch service,"We’re staying at the hotel and for my birthday, the hotel staff recommended The Tiffin Room and I’m very glad that we listened to him because it was one of the best meals we’ve had. Obviously the food was wonderful and plated beautifully. But the staff were very considerate and made many helpful recommendations.

In terms of the dishes ordered, we had the Paneer Angara Tikka, Baigan Nu Barta, and the Tiffin Box of Kashmiri Lamb Roganjosh and Prawn Balchao. All were fantastic, especially the lamb and the prawn dish.

At the end of the dinner, the restaurant provided a surprise dessert (chocolate gulab jamun) as it was my birthday. The dessert was delicious as well but it was very kind of them to provide this.

Overall, we would love to come back here, even if we were not staying at the hotel. Thank you again to the staff for making my birthday dinner so memorable!"
Good for breakfast,Lots of cold items to choose from and hot dishes cooked to order.The usual excellent Raffles service.
"Excellent Indian food, impeccable service and great ambience!","Excellent Indian food, impeccable service, great ambience! Because of CovID19, the prices are also very reasonable!"
Servie & Ambience VS Food decision,"There is no doubt that Raffles Hotel is an iconic place. In that sense, Tiffin Room does not disappoint. And the staff is so well-trained! Interesting, though, that the staff on the day we dined for dinner were either from S.Korea or India. What does that say about local...
I give the the place an A+ for every employee and decor, serving, presentation... But I give the food a C. We were disappointed in the main courses. That a place of this calibre should resort to over cooking and relying on the standard ""gravy"" of garlic/ginger/onion/tomato/cream that over-shadows the dish is very sad. The Daal Makhani tasted more of over-cooked cream than the wonderful flavours of rajma and whole urid daal. The Paneer makhani, I am willing to bet, was simply cottage cheese cubes simmered in the same gravy as their butter chicken (we are vegetarian so I admit I am guessing). The description said it had fenugreek leaves in it but they were not to be found nor tasted. The benghan ka bharta could have been smoky and light but was instead a very heavy preparation. The rice was too dry to enjoy, instead of being fluffy and soft the way Basmati can be. I realize the place was very empty due to current Virus circumstances. I would have expected more attention to the cooking in that case.
The appetizers were decent - the paalak chaat could have used a bit more spice to contrast how sweet it was. The kebab platter was tasty."
Nice experience,We had a family lunch there today.. The kebabs were excellent - try the dahi and coconut kebab. The chicken tikka kabab was exceptional The biryani rice is strongly recommended. Excellent and unobtrusive service. Suggest they expand choice of beers - currently only Kingfisher is available
Breakfast was the highlight of our stay. Amazing service by Madan,"We looked forward to breakfast every day of our stay. Excellent quality of everything on buffet: fruits, salads, hot foods, soup from menu. We have had breakfast buffets at 5 star hotels around the world. This is one of the best. And we were deeply impressed by the hard-working and friendly service by Madan,""from the heart"". He never stopped. Out of everyone on staff at the hotel, he really made our stay memorable. We look forward to seeing him on our return."
Breakfast at Tiffin Room,"Lovely continental breakfast as a resident. Great selection of cereal, fruit and pastries - as well as a very decent coffee. Highly recommend when staying in the hotel."
Dinner for 2,"Delicious North Indian cuisine. Every time we have been for dinner the quality & the taste of the food is always the best. The spices used is so minimal it is not over powering the taste of the chicken, fish or vegetable. The best chicken Biryani Lucknowi. All the dishes are really tasty."
Good,The food and ambience was good. The chicken in the Briyani was soft and tasty. Don't forget to order rice.
Tiffin Room Raffles Hotel,"This used to be one of my favourite eating places in town. It recently reopened and has a new management. The old chef is gone and the choice is not really what it used to be. In addition,, eating you take the entire buffet or you eat only a little but pay for the lot. Recommended to have a separate price only for starters or desserts, or have a la carte choice too at lunch time for guests who do not want to eat a lot. The ambiance is still very nice but I feel that standards have gone down"
family lunch,We booked on fairly short notice for lunch. The food is fantastic with a wide variety of tasty Indian options. The home-made pistachio ice cream at the end was perfect. Service was great and will would happily visit again.
Wonderful experience,We were treated very special the moment we entered the hotel. We arrived early and were shown to the Writers bar off the lobby. When our table was ready we were escorted to our table. We ordered the Mera Daba (tiffin box). It was beautifully presented and very good. The service was exceptional. We were made to feel welcomed the minute we entered the hotel. Wonderful experience can’t wait to try the other restaurants.
Raffles Tiffin Room Buffet,"It was not as expected. If you opt for Buffet, please note that the waiter will not tell you that tea and Coffee is not part of the buffet. And later when you pay for your buffet, you have to pay for the tea and coffee as extra charges 12$ per cup. This happen to me. He should have informed that tea/coffee is extra. And Don't order Masala Tea. Tea was cold and not tasting like Masala Tea. Coffee was nice. Food was ok ok. The cauliflower curry given is not at all Indian Style. Deserts were nice."
Tiffin Room nice but overall experience unwelcoming,"We have enjoyed the Tiffin Room for many years. The renovated version is similar - food and service as good. Atmosphere is bit down market (table cloths missing). The problem is (i) access to the restaurant is via a lobby which bears a ""hotel resident guests only"" sign and (ii) there is nowhere to sit and wait if one is early or wants to do some reading etc after the meal. It was explained to me that the whole lobby area is for resident guests but there is an exception for diners while they are dining. So, why have such an exclusionary and unwelcoming attitude and signage? Why not make some space available for sitting (other than a few very publicly places chairs (not tables) at the hotel entrance."
Highlight of our Singapore holiday,"We booked a meal in advance from the UK
We were treated like royalty throughout the evening even though there was a large party of over 20 students as well as a few family tables
Special note to others tap water is free
We had the pleasure of being served by several different waiters who were so attentive
The meal was to die for
We had a mixed platter starter cooked to perfection which included a fabulous mid size prawn only available at the Tiffin Room from Vietnam-we were told
Our two main dishes of Lamb shank and Chicken Masala were so tasty
The chef even came out to ask what we thought
Thanks to everyone for a truly memorable evening"
Tiffin Room,Overpriced and Underwhelming. The Indian food is alright (not great / not bad) until you see the final invoice - 12 SGD for a chai tea and you have to pay for tap water. Definitely better Indian restaurants in Singapore.
extremely disappointing customer service,"I made a reservation for breakfast at 08:30 on 29-Jan-20 via e-mail. The first reply was a confirmation for dinner at 8:15pm!!! The second reply was that breakfast is only until 08:30!!! HOWEVER, their website is clearly stating: ""...Semi-Buffet Breakfast 6:30am to 10:30am..."". They called me and informed me that 8:30am to 10:30am is reserved for in-house guests only. What a joke!!! ANYWAY, I will spend my money somewhere else for my birthday breakfast"
Pleasant high tea,"We had high tea at the Tiffin Room in Raffles hotel which is iconic. The property is beautiful and kept clean. The high tea was very well serviced all through out the 1 1/2 time they give. We are vegetarians and requested this for our sandwiches and they had told us that they even made sure all our desserts were vegetarian as well. Note they use fish sauce for some of the desserts in place of lard since its halal so if your allergic or vegetarian please note it during the booking. The tea was nice the scones were ok could have been better. The main is the service, Hassan the manager came by our table many times and gave us scones and constanty refilled our teapots, told us about the fish sauce and even answered our questions he was very pleasant. Very enjoyable!"
Very disappointing,"The service was extremely poor. 5 waiting staffs attended us, out of which only one has some clue of serving etiquette (or at least did not pass plates and cutleries in front of us and turned around the table). We had to ask several times for someone to pour us the water (Bedoit bottle at $14). We waited almost 15 minutes after we finished the appetizers for someone to take the order of the main courses. The waiter was just insisting for ordering naan. Food just average and portion quite small. Frankly I had better naan in any Indian stalls in Little India (cheese almost inexistent and not uniformly well cooked, with raw dough in the edges). They forgot the rice that arrived almost when we finished the mains. We order a bottle of Champagne. We pointed out that the shape of the glasses didn't seems to be suitable for bubbles (that indeed disappeared soon) and the waiter insisted that it was the correct model. Surprisingly fitting well also red and white wines in the tables around us! We received the dessert and bill and the table was still cover by rice and crumples. 2 minutes later they announced the restaurant was about to close. It was just 10pm. Had higher expectation for a fine dinging restaurant at Raffles Hotel. Was quite embarrassing having invited guests there."
"Iconic Hotel, Good Restaurant, ZERO customer service from the Manager - Mr. Rohan","We stayed at the glorious Raffles Hotel in a fabulous suite over New Year's, and spent thousands of dollars at the property. Everything was great, until the time we booked The Tiffin Room for Dec 31st to celebrate New Year’s Eve and my brother’ 49th Birthday. We requested a few different tables in the lobby area for these special celebrations and even though some of the other Hotel Managers agreed, Mr. Rohan, The Tiffin Room Manager would not accommodate us. It wasn’t just that he wouldn’t agree to the request, but it was his utter nonchalance and seeming disdain that was appalling. We spent 34 min in this back and forth with the property, but Mr. Rohan did not care and would not budge.

When we returned for the celebratory evening, I introduced my family to Mr. Rohan as we took our table. Again, not a smile or even a greeting. He knew of the special birthday request and could not utter a “Happy Birthday” to my brother. Throughout the night, he circled and served other tables, but not once stopped by to simply say hello, ensure if we were doing okay or needed anything. With this horrible attitude, he ruined our evening and a special celebration. Not sure where Raffles’ customer excellence disappeared in this case!

We would have loved to return to The Raffles again this year, but now we are seriously considering staying at The Ritz Carlton in Dec 2020."
Iconic location. Average food.,"We visited TR for dinner in Christmas Day with family. While we love the restaurant ambience (it’s Raffles hotel after all) and the service was great, the food left is rather underwhelmed.
The prices are high, which one wouldn’t mind if the food was worth it. The portion sizes are rather tiny for the price you pay
and some of the items are not even tasty (eg, Gujrati dal Tadka).
The afternoon buffet might be a better choice and better value for money."
Return to Home,"The Raffles Hotel is iconic. It has history and splendour which is unmatched. After much time away from living in Singapore I returned to the Tiffin Room for a special birthday.

What a disappointment!

The setting is still beautiful and benefits from a recent upgrade.

The service was barely OK. Confused at times.

The food is decidedly average and has tainted my memories. I have had better food from Indian chains. Lots of average sauce and little content inside.

There is no point this establishment trading off its history. It needs to deliver excellent food as it always used too."
Bad service ruined my hotel experience,"I was so looking forward to seeing this hotel's updated look since it reopened a few months ago. My hotel, The Four Seasons Hotel on Orchard, was able to get me one of the last two slots that was available for Sunday Afternoon Tea. When we got there precisely for our reservation, our table wasn't ready. While we waited, we appreciated the complimentary tea given by our server. However, after being seated, we didn't see our server anymore. It was hard to get the attention of other servers. They weren't understaffed. It would have been nice if our server delegated us to someone else if he had to go or his shift had ended. There were tables around us that seemed to be getting all the attention. We asked for the bill in advance, aware that we had to be somewhere else soon. We had to call the hotel's attention there times until we finally got the bill. This is disappointing for a hotel that had/has such distinction and history. A reopening should come with improvements on all fronts."
Wish the food matched the ambience,"I was looking forward to my trip to the updated Tiffin Room as the last time I went before the refurbishment I enjoyed it both service and food. However, this time though the service and ambience were very good, the food was not. It is not the quality I would expect from the Raffles Hotel. In place where we have an abundant selection of great Indian restaurants this was sub optimal."
Family dinner,"We had a family dinner here on a Sunday, we had a reservation but surprisingly not many people in the restaurant.

We then started to order a few dishes Inc the signature tiffin box. Overall the food was above average and the service average only.

I reckon there's quite a lot to be improved in this restaurant, the ambiance is quite charming but I reckon with an improved service it would bring much to the expected standards from diners."
Unhappy with Tiffin Room,"Hello, we had gone to Tiffin Room to celebrate my husband's 36th birthday. We were not happy with the food or the service. The food was very okay and they did not have the flexibility to curate the menu inspite of having very limited items. We were keen to have a gravy based paneer curry but were told that it cannot be made. Normally a 5 star is very flexible in whipping up options but this sadly was not. We felt that we were rushed into finishing our dinner - there was a waiter who constantly came and urged us to move on with our meal - this left a very unpleasant impression in our minds. I had put in a special request to help make my husband's birthday special by doing a complimentary celebration (many restaurants and hotels do) but they had forgotten and I had to go remind them - made us feel as if we are begging for it. Lastly, we found the waiter quite odd as even though he knew I am paying for the dinner since it was my treat to my husband - he never handed the bill to me even when I asked and never handed the card back to me once payment was done. He was clearly only interacting with my husband - a very chauvinistic attitude to have in this day and age. Overall, even though it has a royal and colonial feel - we were not happy with our experience at Tiffin Room and would not recommend this to anyone. Pretty disappointing to ruin your special day like this."
Great Ambience. Smiling And Attentive Staff.,"I had booked this place for my Wife's birthday dinner with few friends. The Hotel seemed dull in energy considering weekday evening. It's a long walk from North Bridge drop-off to Tiffin Room. We arrived nearly on time and were welcomed with a smile. We were seated exactly in the middle. The hall gave a feel of British era.

The starters (vegetarian and non-vegetarian) were yummiest I ever had. specially 'Khyber chicken tikka' and 'Jhinga Tiger Prawns'. The quantity was too meagre and we had to repeat every dish again. Specially vegetarian starter platter was a joke. 3 pieces of paneer,potato served in a smallest possible dish literally. But that was kinda expected. We had range of wines and finished 3 bottles.
We requested to shift to sofa in the middle of the dinner as my kid was sleepy and were promptly entertained by staff. They setup everything on the new table and were served main course there. We were too full to enjoy main course and did not really ordered much.
Biggest disappointment was desserts. we ordered 5 different Indian desserts and each one of them were disappointing. Probably because they want to maintain sugar level to minimum considering health aspects. A warning for people with sweet tooth.

They could have probably given a special attention to Birthday girl but none of that sort happened.
Altogether we had a nice and memorable evening with attentive staff and yummiest starters.

Cost - $800 for 6 pax."
One of the best place to dine in.,"I brought my parents to Tiffin Room on 3rd Dec 2019 for Dinner. It was an appreciation dinner for them. I love how the way the Staffs greated us from the door till Tiffin Room. The moment we entered Tiffin Room, my parents felt so welcomed by the cheerful staffs. My parents are abit chosy about the food. It's a miracle, they loved every dishes of it. A special shoutout to Tiffin Room Team. They showered us with extra care and love. Thank you.

If you ever drop by Raffles Hotel, Tiffin Room is well recommended."
Beautiful place to share a celebration meal,"We pre booked dinning in the Tiffin room on our first night in Singapore & loved the food & experience of this grand hotel.
Fabulous selection of North Indian cuisine dishes that can be shared together. Staff very attentive as we booked at 6.30pm with not many other diners present. Be aware of drink prices, especially water as staff continually refill your glass that increases your costs. Well worth the visit as the hotel dates back to 1892 & renovated to its glory in August 19."
Sadly Average,"I was so looking forward to lunch in the Iconic Raffles Tiffin Room. We chose it as a birthday celebration treat. I was surprised how small the room was - tucked into a corner of the lobby. I loved the collection of different tiffin containers but was not sure what the blue and white Chinese plates were doing there? The buffet spread for lunch was quite small and uninspired. It was all a bit boring. The waiters seemed in a rush to get us through lunch - it certainly wasn't a leisurely exercise. We were asked if we would like coffee and ordered a latte each. A small, average coffee arrived in a cappucino cup for which we were charged $14 each. I know that Singapore coffee is expensive - but that is ridiculous! Overall, it was nice to visit but I wouldn't go again."
"Iconic location, good food","Booked in for dinner with friends post the renovation of Raffles, partly to check out the new decor and partly to try expensive Indian food. The venue and decor didn’t disappoint - despite the sign at the front advising residents only, you do get to go through the front door to get to the restaurant. The foyer and chandelier is magnificent!! The tiffin room is off to the left and no less grand. Beautiful display of tiffin boxes and staff are subtle, respectful and efficient. Food wise, we stuck to all vegetarian options, presentation was flawless and flavours excellent. The snacks and entrees won over dinner and being a chocolate fan, I never find Indian desserts to be too appealing, there were approx 4-5 to choose from, we shared 2 the mango and a berry one. Wines were great with a fabulous rose on offer. Loved that the naans were complimentary."
Overpriced and subpar quality Indian food,"Celebrated a family birthday/anniversary here on 10th November 2019. I was honestly flabbergasted by our poor experience. (1) The food was of worse than average quality. The ingredients were not fresh, the portions were minuscule, and there was little imaginative about the dishes. (2) The prices were consistently twice or three times as much as the value of the food. (3) The service was inattentive--water bottles were not refilled, nobody checked in on us during the meal, and it wasn't even a particularly busy evening. There is so much high quality Indian food in Singapore--don't ever go to the Tiffin Room."
The Tiffin Room in the Revamped Raffles Hotel is Superb,"Raffles is one of our favourite hotels so we were excited to visit again after it's most recent facelift. The Tiffin Room is an institution at Raffles so we were delighted to see this latest incarnation done with so much flair and style. I adored the interior - a moody feel with a decor that celebrates the Tiffin boxes of India. Everything about our visit here was fabulous - to the welcome at the hotel itself, to experiencing the grand lobby on our way to the Tiffin Room. They have a lovely old fashioned drinks trolley full of by the glass wine options which was a lovely idea. We started with a glass of Rose Billecart-Salmon champagne, a fantastic Chardonay/Sauvignon Blanc blend from India (a perfect match to our entree) and then a wonderful French syrah blend. The sommelier, Krishna, was just lovely and we really enjoyed his enthusiasm and the wonderful wine selections for our dinner. I am gluten free and so I was delighted that the Chef prepared some gluten-free Naan for me!

What I love about the interior of this restaurant is there is plenty of space - a luxury in modern restaurants of today. And every seat is fabulous because of the wonderful decor with something of interest on every wall - without being busy.

Just loved this restaurant and it was a real treat to visit."
Incredible experience,"The Tiffin Room is an institution - and rightly so. The food is great but really the main reason to go is the whole experience of Raffles Hotel history, grandeur and decadence. Arriving at Raffles and being greeted by the liveried Sikh Doormen is a tradition, being escorted into the Tiffin Room and simply being overwhelmed by the beautiful decore is a wonderful start. The sommeliers are very knowledgeable and have a great range of wines by the glass to match with your choice of Indian dishes done as single serves or multi-course in ""tiffins"". It's expensive - but worth it!"
Pure elegance!!!,"My husband and I enjoyed the pleasure of the most wonderful evening at the Tiffin Room when visiting Singapore last month. The food was outstanding!!! I am not big on Indian food as it is nearly always too spicy for me...Even when I request they go easy. But this time, they did not dissapoint. The space is elegant and relaxed and the service and staff were beyond lovely and accommodating, which made for a very special experience. :)"
Rude staff in need of hospitality training,"Just left this horrible establishment after a most disagreeable experience. I had come to dine in the hotel's BBR restaurant, but was told that owing to an event I could have the option of dining in Tiffin. I gladly agreed, but was then met by a member of the staff who proceeded to interrogate me as if I was a suspect in a crime in order to determine if I was up to their standards before allowing me the honor of paying them for dinner. Another staffer joined in, but the damage was done. This was an incredibly insulting 10 minutes of being questioned in order to eat. Rather than continue to submit to this level of insult, I chose to leave and ended up a nearby hotel restaurant which was happy for my business. This hotel needs to teach its staff some manners. In a word, Raffles is a great museum, but a badly run hotel. Stay away."
Stunning room,"Stunning room definitely worth going to see. We had dinner here which is North Indian food served in tiffin boxes, lovely authentic food goodatteyservice"
Afternoon tea,Afternoon tea - the food was good.. loads of sweet cakes .. staff attentive.. however my visit was booked through Kuoni before I left the UK.. this was definitely a negative.. several references were made by staff that we were Prepaid customers and the choice of actual tea was limited and poor..we were made to feel we were not good enough to have afternoon tea with others patrons .. due to being prepaid ..
First Class Service and Food,We had breakfast in the Tiffin Room and found that the staff could not have been more helpful. The choice of buffet items was everything we wanted and the only slight issue was that there was no Cranberry juice which for a hotel of this reputation was a surprise.
Lunch buffet i Tiffin room,"After the extensive renovation of Raffles Hotel it was with high expectation I revisited the Indian lunch buffet in Tiffin room.
The staff was very stringent on opening hours so to arrive 5 minutes before booking time at 12.00 hrs resulted in one of the hosts sending us to wait standing in the lobby of the hotel - as there were several hosts I expected to be advised when we would be welcome but this did not happen so I had to try another time to get our table and the hostess looked surprised we were still here and showed us the booked table.
The staff were disappointingly self centered and although plenty of staff the service was slow and it required several requests to be able to settle the bill.
The buffet which I before considered the best Indian meal in SEA have been drastically reduced to 3 small tables cold / hot and a small dessert table.
The smaller buffet is now supplemented with some of the staff serving dishes at tables as well as Naan bread - this is not working very well as the staff not have feeling for when each tables has started their meal. I love the previous freshly prepared Naan bread w/wo garlic but this is now served only and it appeared greasy and not as delicious as before.
The curries and condiments I also found less delicious as previously and the visit turned therefore into a disappointment."
Excellent Food & Service,We celebrated our 24th wedding anniversary in the Tiffin Room. Raffles Hotel has just opened after a complete renovation & we found the hotel beautiful and awesome. The food was delicious & the staff were very attentive and courteous. Will definitely come again.
Fantastic dinner in the Tiffin Room,"My wife and I had dinner there last night.

Raffles Hotel is a beautiful place, steeped in history. We spent some time wandering through the hotel. All of the staff were helpful and pleasant. We took pictures with the guards at the front. It was great.

The restaurant itself feels quite formal. As another reviewer commented, there is a sign that says hotel patrons only. This made us feel like we were part of on exclusive club. The staff soon make you feel at ease. They are very chatty and welcoming.

The dishes were very good. I wouldn’t say outstanding, but the food scored 8 or 9 out of 10. My wife liked the lamb rogan josh the best; dal makhani for me. All of the details, including the tiffin themselves are exquisite.

Lastly, we thought the price was very reasonable. Our bill was less than S$140 for two. This place could charge 2 or 3 times that price and still be plenty busy.

100% recommended."
Sunday Lunch Buffet at the Tiffin Room,"Average overall, owing to a few service lapses.

Issue 1: Booked a table 3 weeks in advance. Called the day before to request for an additional person to be added to the reservation (one of my friends had a guest to bring along). Had to call twice since no one was answering the phone. Staff answered and told me that they would get back to us if they could accommodate an additional person. Didnt get a call back either confirming/not confirming. Expected better from Raffles.

Issue 2: Food: Flavours were dialled down and was catering to a western palette. Thankfully there was a good range of achars to add if one needed more heat.

Issue 3: Took a while before the breads were brought out. We weren't asked specifically what breads we would like. Got regular and garlic naan (which tasted good) but it would be nice to be asked what we'd like.

Overall, average experience."
Great Ambience and good food,"In the third week of September ie soon after it had reopened since the renovation visited with a few friends. Overall feel of Raffles hotel is preserved. Tiffin room is now to be accessed through the main lobby(in the if I remember correctly, it used to be side entrance). However, the entrance to the main lobby carries a board saying only for residents- so a bit misleading there. So you have to tell the security that you are there for dining at Tiffin room and he will let you in.

Ambience looks grander than before. They have done away with their dinner buffets- now it is just alacarte. The menu options are good, though not many to choose from. The two appetizers and three mains we got were quite nice. The service was prompt and polite as before. We were just a bit disturbed by one of their guys trying to dictate what we should order inspite of us being quite clear with what we wanted-he was a bit unusually hard selling for certain stuff.That apart the experience was good.
Besides tasting good, the servings were reasonable in volume- 2 mains adequate for 3 persons. The food items were reasonably priced for a restaurant in its league(cost around 300 for 4 persons - excluding drinks) while drinks could be considered on the pricier side.
Overall a good experience."
Charming Raffles experiences,"Coming to the Raffles hotel is an experience in itself. This was our first visit after the renovation, and we simply loved just admiring the architecture, the gleaming white walls, grand chandeliers and marble floors, and the feeling of being surrounded by history. We visited for our anniversary dinner, and arrived a bit early, so popped over to the Writer’s bar for a drink. Small, cosy and very aesthetically pleasing. Completely loved the menu presented as a travel journal (remember your reading glasses though, I didn’t!) Prices were steep, but I guess that’s expected. Service was excellent.
Now on to the Tiffin room itself. Again, beautiful ambience, excellent service, yummy food, good portion sizes and overall fab experience. The Tiffin carrier is a good deal, and the appetiser platters were superb, both the veg and meat versions. The only disappointment was not being acknowledged at all for our anniversary, though I had mentioned it on the booking (done directly over the phone with the restaurant itself).
Overall a great experience, and we will definitely go again."
