"Decent, but other mid-priced Indian restaurants still better",pros: - good service - great naan and butter chicken - ambience was ok; probably seating inside is better - portions were big cons: - expensive - rice was $8 - bombay frankie was too salty
Another great find by daughter,"Daughter loves Indian food. We loved it too! Reservation was made. We sat inside on high chairs. The staffs were friendly. Great food and taste good too! Will
Definitely visit again."
Two excellent Indian meals.,We dined twice at this restaurant outside our hotel. The food and service were excellent on both occasions. Make sure you have a parata..
Terrible food and overpriced,"Dabbawalla should revisit their menu and change their chef. Food was really tasteless and overpriced. Order lamb vindaloo, zaffarini broccoli and saffron rice. We could only taste the chili and lamb had no flavour. the broccoli was soggy and bland as well. the worst was they charged $34 for lamb vindaloo and $22 for broccoli.

We have eaten at hawker stalls which had more flavour and soul than this restaurant. Don't trust the high reviews like we did. it doesn't match up. Adviced to give this place a miss."
No value for money,"Visited recently, the food quality detoriated over last 2years. Last visited the restaurant during 2019, food quality was very good.

Ordered tandoori pamphlet, they gave golden pamphlet at the cost of silver one. Ordered Chilly chicken in starter, I got chilly chicken gravy one. Lamb chop was not tasty at all.

Service quality is still intact but overall no value for money…"
Favorite place for Indian Cuisine.,"Definitely the favorite place for Indian cuisine. A warm welcome from the staff as we arrived. We don’t need to wait to decide for the dish that we liked as we have been to this place a couple of times. We highly recommended their mixed meat platter, perfect for your appetizer and their butter chicken along with saffron rice and garlic naan. If you’re just a couple, those foods mentioned are good enough for sharing and still have space for awesome desserts.

Loved their wine selection as well. Their wine of the month is another must try. Actually if you're not sure just ask the brilliant staff. They know and will recommend the best stuff that suits your taste.

Overall, it is always a great experience to dine here. So, if you’re wondering where is the good place for a casual date or family dinner, you must include this on your list."
Underwhelming!!,"Underwhelming !! Pav bhaji contains peanuts, boondi and sev !!
Definitely not Mumbai style !!
Maybe I had high expectations but definitely underwhelmed after the experience.
Also wish they improve the quantity !!"
My favorite Indian in Singapore,"This place is a must for anyone who is a fan of Indian food. The Dabba Gosht is particularly excellent.
It is not the cheapest Indian food in Singapore, but for those on a budget, there is plenty of street venders in Little India or local Hawker centers. This is a proper restaurant in a classy location, which I could not recommend highly enough.
The staff and management are also super friendly, always willing to try and fit you in, even when its busy."
Fun restaurant. Friendly service,"Fun restaurant. Friendly service and upbeat environment. The food is very very good. We enjoyed the Samosa, Dahl and garlic naan. Yum."
Overpriced and mediocre quality,"Food too expensive, drinks hilariously overpriced. Food quality not good! Butter chiicken smokey, Fish Curry with battered fish, Samosas only potato, onion baji had no onion on there, old and refried... Cucumber drink for 18$, Food nothing below 23$... There are much better places in SG!"
"Rude staff, not ever coming back","Incredibly rude staff, arrived and when requested to use entertainer, was rudely told that they don’t usually accept entertainer during the weekends. Note that this was not listed on the app and when asked if it was on the app they just said, ‘we don’t accept entertainer during the weekends’ with no explanation, the restaurant was basically empty and they were not apologetic at all. Walked straight out and will never bother visiting again. What a disappointment and failure of service!"
Good Indian Restaurant,Good service and good Indian food. My go to place for Indian food in Robertson Quay. Responsive waiters and food continues to be a strong suit given the price.
Dinner for two,"The host seated us just outside the kitchen. As we were choking on the smoke coming from the kitchen we asked to be seated at the different table (inside the restaurant was empty) the host then said outside seating is full.
We asked again to change table and clarified that we don’t mind being inside, just anywhere we’re we aren’t being smoked. (It was incredibly smokey) The host then rudely waved his arms around stating we can go anywhere.
The host is the first impression your restaurant is giving your guest. I’m sorry to say that it has been a terrible experience where we don’t feel welcomed at all."
OCC Review of Dabbawalla - Curry & Cocktails,"The Oakham Curry Club (OCC) is a well-respected Institution with multiple international franchises. This review of ‘Dabbawalla - Curry & Cocktails’ being the (sort of) latest by our Singapore branch. The OCC takes pride in searching out the finest Indian restaurants and providing impartial reviews of Curry Houses all over the world.

Members vote anonymously without being influenced by other members (we call this “no swaying”) on 5 categories, and an average score out of a maximum 10 is given to each restaurant we review.

On Thursday 20th Feb 2020 – The OCC visited Dabbawalla - Curry & Cocktails; Robertson Quay.

For full transparency, see below scores (out of 10). The voting is based on the votes from OCC members. Restaurants must score an average of 7/10 or above to receive the OCC sticker of recommendation. All OCC members have been through a rigorous selection process to gain entry into the Club. In short, we all know our curries.

Quality: 8.41
Customer Care: 9.1
Value: 6.21
Service: 8.56
Atmosphere: 7.82
Overall: 8.02

Dabbawalla IS AWARDED the OCC badge of recommendation and achieves the highest score to date. Value is slightly below par but they smashed everything else, especially customer care.

Hip yet traditional, modern yet authentic – Dabbawalla, our Mumbai inspired restaurant is a high on energy and the bold flavours that typify the food of Mumbai. Located next to the Singapore River, in Robertson Quay, the Dabbawalla, with it’s distinct Mumbai inspired ambience, specially concocted cocktail and street food menu is a foodie’s experience like no other in Singapore. Dabbawalla means ‘one who carries a box’. Dabba means box, usually a tiffin, and walla is a holder. Therefore the English meaning is ‘One who gives food’

If you’ve ever found yourself propped up at the bar waiting for your Guinness to settle, you’ll be reminded that good things come to those who wait. Full disclosure: I’ve had two pints of Guinness in my entire life, and hated both of them, however I am a true believer in procrastination. The act of pondering over something long enough that when it comes to execution you are quite sure that the result is the ultimate best you can give. And so it is with this that I am proud to present the review for Dabbawalla Curry & Cocktails in Robertson Quay. An establishment visited by the OCC in February, and resulting review perfected a mere seven months later.

Let us take you back in time to one month BCE (Before Coronavirus Era). A time before curry consumption was changed the world over. You will find the OCC trickling into Robertson Quay on a quiet Thursday evening to form the congregation that will accept the curry and cocktails being prepared. Many good vibes were ahead. This part of Singapore is heavy on tourist and expat trade, and so full of surrounding bars and pubs. The aforementioned trickle of attendees was so slow that one member had saddled up to the bar opposite the restaurant and in frustration began to consume several early beverages plus some unauthorised snacks that would not form part of the evening’s meal deliberations. But the team assembled in time for proceedings to start promptly as we crossed the not-quite-as-bustling-as-usual footpath to Dabbawalla.

The vibes from the Dabbawalla team were warm. We were shown to our table promptly, even though we could see from a distance that an OCC logo had been placed on the pillar next to it. They had researched their guests and had concluded that the 5-star treatment was to be rolled out. Although pleasantly received by the OCC, this was not going to work as a sway mechanic.

The table was outside (yet undercover) and we were handed menus and offered refreshments in good time. Comfortable seating arrangements, vibrant in colour and lots of scatter cushions. I remember many cushion vibes. With a strong emphasis on the ‘cocktails’ in the restaurant name, and with a large contingent of members having taken in pre-beers, a middle ground was agreed on where half of the team would experiment with prosecco to the meal and the other half remain on beers for consistency. The beers were solid Kingfishers, and the OCC is yet to find a restaurant serving the elusive Cobra.

On to the food. And all we can collectively say is….yes! The food was wonderful. Flavours and spice vibes were cracking across the board. We would have ordered everything again, with maybe the exception of the tandoori mushrooms (unless you were veggie...or potentially vegan). We could go into the specifics of certain dishes, but on this occasion the review takes a much more holistic approach with the passing of time, one remembers that the whole experience is one that will be revisited with gusto. Good food vibes.

One thing to note on the price. Given the skew towards cocktails and bubbles, and given the location of the establishment, it is not totally surprising that the final bill came in towards the top end of previous OCC expeditions, hence the drop in scoring regarding value. But when looking for a trip to a curry house which will deliver on food, service and vibes (at a price) we couldn’t recommend Dabbawalla enough. You, your other half, or your visiting in-laws will appreciate it.

Vibes."
Good food but no social distancing,"Good food. Service was also friendly. However, they seated diners in close proximity to each other and not in line with the governments social distancing guidelines. I warned them when they seated two diners immediately next to us, they took no action, so eventually we had to move to an inside corner to avoid fines. Restaurant risks the ire of Ministry of Health if they continue to disobey social distancing guidelines. Go at your own risk."
Amazing Prawn Biryani.,"Went to Dabbawala as a part of our date night.
Ordered the Tandoori platter for appetizer, Prawn Biryani for main course and the brownies with ice cream for dessert.
The food was super tasty and flavorful, the staff was also super helpful and friendly.
The prawn Biryani was to die for, definitely the best I have eaten in Singapore as it is made spicy and the North Indian way.
Enjoyed all the meats on the platter as well.
Would definitely be back."
Quality Indian Fare @ Robertson Quay,"Overall good. Not cheap but the Indian Food quality is good. For the Robertson Quay area, I would say the best Indian food in the hood. I would go again."
Fab food,"A great find. Felt like Indian food after a couple of nights of Chinese/Singaporean. Amazing food, atmosphere and service. Give it a go."
Very good food/service!,"Came for dinner after craving good Indian food - Loved every bite.

Started with drinks - which were fantastic and refreshing - had some snacks and then finished with two curries.

Everything was very good - flavours were rich and had levels - every meal that came out for other tables had us looking over to see what they had got as it smelt so good."
Go to Indian,"Three years later and we still go back week after week. The food is fantastic but the staff make it special! I would dare anyone say it’s not worth the time, it is worth it!

Staff sent me a video (so wish I could attach) singing birthday wishes! Where on earth would you get that? Made my year!

Staff are special, very special, and the food is great without the expense."
Top Notch,"We chose Dabbawalla after walking past earlier in the day. Mostly under cover outside seating, the food was amazing with s selection of dishes that I've never seen before. The staff were helpful and friendly and everything was clean and tidy. Loved it, wish we were staying longer because we'd definitely go back. Great evening."
Good quality food,Very nice food and very accommodating to us. Some of my family wanted non menu dishes and they sorted it no problem
Not the best place of vegetarians,"Ambience: This restaurant has pretty good ambience. 3.5/5
Location: Not far from ClarkQuay and For canning , surrounded by many other dinning places. 4.5 / 5
Food taste: Taste was good and will not dissatisfy your cravings , yeah but bit hot, they use lot of green chilies, we ordered chana masala was kind of average taste. I liked the cheese naan, which was kind of pizza :) never tried alike before. Kashmiri pulao was good. 3.5 / 5
Value for money : slightly overpriced for the taste of food offered. 3 / 5
Menu : Best suited for non vegetarians and boozers, vegetarians will find limited choice, my wife wasn't happy with me choosing this venue as we are vegetarians.
Service: Service is good , staff is gentle and polite. veg : 2.5 / 5 , non veg 4 / 5.

Recommendations: Will recommend to give yourself a try not a bad choice either if you like non veg. Vegetarians who like limited choices can visit, but not the best place for vegetarians."
Good but expensive,"Good Indian food, some dishes extreme spicy. Nice location and good service, prices are pretty expensive."
Expensive and Average,"Visited the restaurant for my husbands birthday.
Food was average and expensive for the ambiance. The place is an open restaurant.
We ordered chicken main course and that tasted below average. Chicken was not cooked properly and had a very pungent frozen smell. Keema matar tasted nice and daal makhni was ok too.
However, service is great and staff is super sweet."
Excellent introduction to good curry!,"I've had limited exposure to Indian food - although I've loved the few times that I've had curry dishes. Consequently decided to venture forth and give this place a try. Besides, with a name like Dabbawalla, how can you go wrong?
The host (I've forgotten his name) was awesome! What a great personality - it was fun to interact and talk with him! He served as my guide and set me up with some excellent food. I really enjoyed this place - the atmosphere and food was relaxing and appropriate. Will eat here again."
Always Live Up To My Expectation,"I used to frequent Curry Culture in Cuppage some time back and they always serve up good spicy vindaloos according to my taste buds. This time Dabbawalla, which is also managed by Curry Culture retains the same standard. We were very amazed that some stuffs who were from Curry Culture still remembered us after all those years & what amazed me more is his question of 'so which level of vindaloo today?' That impressed me immensely at the thought of attentiveness. So we ordered level 12 of the lamb vindaloo and did some for takeaway too. I must say this team of people never disappoint me and the taste is just superb. It satisfied my curry cravings. Ambience at the Quayside is really nice. The area have been revamped to something chic & hip. Nice place to hangout. Kudos once again to Sandeep and team!"
Authentic Indian food that leaves you satiated for your Indian food cravings,"Authentic Indian food that reminds me a really tasty Bombay Street food. Went here on a recommendation from an Indian Food loving Caucasian Foodie. I trust foodies on good food options and he was a good judge on this one. closely situated to the Intercontinental Clarke Quay and a short walk to Robertson walk, it’s authentic Chicken Tikka Masala ordered spicy was fire and just what I hoped for and the garlic naan reminded me of the first time I had it where it was the perfect level of crispy and pillowy. I’ll definitely hit this place up again."
Sunday night,Sunday night curry at this relaxed curry place on the waterfront. Great Assam fish curry and mutton Railway curry. Chick pea side dish was a revelation!
The kitchenwallas at Dabbawalla are masters at dabbling with flavours,"One might be tempted to think that restaurants in this area are more bars with food rather than serious gastronomic destinations. Pleasant surprise at Dabbawalla. Although the friendly staff do make it a fun place, the food is also quite scrumptious, especially the curries and the yummy naan. It may not be as refined as Rang Mahal, but prices aren’t the same either! If you have Entertainer, it’s great value."
Decent place to have Indian food.,This place is nice to have Indian food in Robertson Quay. Although the taste of the food is not very mind blowing to recall you for next visit. Service was good with smile.
Hygiene compromised,Variety of food available and good. Issue only about hygiene - table was cleaned using the used left over tissues.
Poor service let the place down,"We booked the place for 7pm. We hadn’t finished our dinner and were asked to vacate our table or move to a small table at 8:40pm as they had a bigger party of 12 apparently. Of course we were not told we had limited time when we made the reservation. At close to 400$ bill for 4 adults and 4 very young kids this type of service is not expected. Never going to this place again.

The food was ok but given the service and experience I would not recommend this place.

After vacating the table for them I spoke to the owner and expressed my disappointment. He was quick to offer free dessert which was a nice gesture but our evening was ruined by then."
Awesome food!,"One of best indian restaurant in Singapore, great food and great service. Thanks to Mr Chobe for great service. Would love to visit again"
Disappointing,Went with great expectations after reading good reviews. But found the food to be quite average and certainly not worth the price. Service was also rather poor! Overall a disappointing experience!
Bruch,"I just don’t have the heart to even give these guys even 1 star. We went have lunch with friends. Even with reservations they gave us bar chairs to sit for lunch but with repeated request our seats were changed. They have waiter or customer care provider Mr Chubey. He is brash ill mannered and pushy. He tries very hard to be friendly but come out as pushy person. The food was below average. The cuisines are mixed up . I am Bong who has connections with Assam to me he told me food in Assam is cook in coconut oil. When I said let me talk to the Chef he tried to evade the question. They were closing down kitchen by 2 pm understandable but there is away to request you customers to proceed and place order. He was like ordering can you place order now. When we asked to change the menu a bit he was not happy. When my friend asked for extra dal he busted snapped by saying I can an only serve you rice now.
This restaurant is not cheap but it has no value for money . One of the worst restaurant experience."
Hearty Indian fare,Curries here never disappoint and the naan breads are generous and fluffy. Service is prompt and friendly. Will continue to visit as long as I have Entertainer vouchers!
Absolutely wonderful,"A fabulous meal, with a fabulous atmosphere. Travelling alone, and the team here made me feel incredibly welcome. Had the best butter chicken I’ve ever tasted. Shame it’s my last night otherwise I’d be back for more."
Excellent Food,"We had a lovely evening eating at this restaurant! The guy out front was very nice and welcoming! We were offered poppadoms as we sat down and ordered quickly after! We order chicken tikka and butter chicken and we weren’t disappointed! The food was just excellent, as was the service! We we recommend a visit to this restaurant if ever you are in Singapore!"
Big Disappointment!,"The only Indian restaurant at Robertson quay is just not worth a visit. Ambience is nice but very poor service. We had requested for a table change, till 15-20 mins there was no response. Servers kept ignoring our table call (which was quite irritating) even after walking past us a few times. Drinks and Dinner were served very late post ordering, reorder of a basket of bread took 20 mins to come and by then we had finished eating the curries. In the end we had a big fat bill and extremely unsatisfactory meal!"
Visited on back to back days!,We thoroughly enjoyed both trips to this restaurant when we were in Singapore recently. The service and food were both incredible - the best butter chicken I’ve eaten!! I have already recommended Dabbawalla to friends who are visiting the country soon.
"Fantastic place, very tasty and reasonably priced!","Me and my partner visited here twice during our week stay in Singapore, just to give you an idea of how much we enjoyed it there. Could not recommend this place more, We had the Madras, Butter Chicken and Tikka Masala which we couldn't fault. Staff were very friendly and helpful

When I next visit Singapore I will 100% be taking a trip back here!"
Yummy Indian restaurant,"We were craving for Indian food. We found this and just loved the food. The fish was so delicious. The chicken kabobs just melted in our mouths. Oh my gosh the service was so good that we went back next day too. Prabha looked after us so well from the time we entered to the time we left.
I will give it 5 stars."
good food,Simply great. the service was amazing and lovely.did take great care of us. All food was stunning.Atmosphere could be a bit more warm and genuine
Amazing Amazing Amazing,"We visited this restaurant twice whilst in Singapore this month.
Absolutely well prepared foods, came piping hot and these people know how to cook and please! Manager lovely , we have seen him before, he always finds time to have a chat.
Can reccomend the butter chicken superb !
Sat outside had a wonderful evening, staff just lovely and helpful and made our evening very enjoyable.
Dont miss this experience ! whilst on Robertson Quay"
RAILWAY MUTTON,"Had another great takeaway from Dabbawalla, Being from UK You know we are curry aficionado's, In fact it's our National dish! Enjoyed the Railway Mutton combined with the romantic black dhall (cooked for 24 hours over a lazy fire) mushroom pulao and Parathas. All very good. Recommended by My Indian Friends also, so you know it's good and authentic. Great treat."
Evening meal,"Researched Trip Advisor to locate this restaurant as the provided gluten free options. I contacted the restaurant through trip advisor to ask about their gluten free options a we were promptly contacted with answers to our query.
We arrived to a warm welcome and we ordered our meals, the food was great tasting and reasonably priced. Would we visit again? Definitely"
"Contemporary Indian food, nice vibe","We came across Dabbawalla while walking in the area. The menu looked good and so did the restaurant feeling and decor.

We decided to give it a shot and it did not disappoint. One of the best Indian meals we had in a very long time. The chilli cheese naan was great and so was the yellow dahl dish. The chicken tikka masala was also very tasty.

Prices wise while it is not on the cheap side, in my opinion it is worth every cent of it. Great place to have a good Indian meal in a nice contemporary atmosphere and location."
Very Average Food ; awesome Service,"The service in this restaurant was really awesome. I love the open air setting near Clarke Quay and the many food options around ..

But we were grossly disappointed with the food. The Mumbai sheet food signs outside was a major pull factor. But all the appetisers we ordered fell flat and was way below par in taste. The peanuts had so much masala and no balance taste to it. The onion pakoras has too much gram flour and was really bad. The samosa chat was tasteless too and I couldn’t understand how one could be wrong in all three.

The main course was very average and oily too. All in all, I would not recommend a visit to this restaurant unless it’s for the ambience or a drink."
Lovely Authentic dinner,Dabbawalla was the perfect end to a great day in Singapore. Tasty Makhani Dahl and lamb dishes along with Raika and garlic naan. Yum. Friendly people and authentic home style Indian cooking.
Very small portions and a total rip off !,"The interiors are good and food taste is not bad. However portions are very small for the price. See some of the pics. We ordered a lassi which was served in a baby glass. In starter we ordered onion Bhajis, which were served 5 in numbers. The portion of vegetables was also extremely small. We were a couple, ordered lassi, couple of beers, one starter, two vegetarian dishes and chapatis. The bill was about SGD 110 !"
Good service but average food,"I visited Dabbawalla with three colleagues from India. We all agreed the staff were freindly and helpful but the food was average. We all ordered different dishes but the sauces were quite similar inlcuding the vegeatarian dishes.

Like many Indian restaurants outside of India and UK the food is disappointing.

Bullet beer is a great accompaniment."
Overpriced but ok,I find this joint highly overpriced for what you are getting. You are basically paying for the premium (?) location. Dishes were tasty but paying 6$ for Naan or 25$ for Butter Chicken is insane.
"Very good Indian food, perfect service, high recommended","The food was great, vindaloo was great, level 7 with lamb, and I was surprised by the fact that they claim that can tune down spicy level, I asked to tune down my vindaloo to 4 and they did it, it was less spicy, well done."
"The staff is friendly, the service ok, the food is disappointing","The chicken tandori was mushy, was it a hybrid chicken in a tube?
The fish was unidentifiable.
The kebab was ok. The lamb was meuh.
The cheese nan was delicious.
The mango lassi ok, but really tiny."
Good place for Indian cuisine,Authentic Indian taste. Varieties of dishes to choose from. However being a sort of street food corner the ambience is not well set.During peak times difficult to get a table without pri reservation.
Good place,"I found it to be a good place for Indians to have food. Not regular tough. The options may be limited as compared to India but the food overall is good. I liked the drink Walla's Wife which had mango, coconut and fresh mint. The place does charge service charge of 10% but waits to be tipped as well. This was a bit odd."
Fantastic,"Great Tasting food, great staff, a must visit while in Singapore. The naan were fresh and fabulous and the onion Bhaji the best ever."
Tasty Indian food in Clarkson Quay,"This is a nice spot to eat Indian in Clarkson quay.

The broccoli appetizer and Chaag were very good.

We tried prawn Biryani, chicken Korma, an eggplant vegetarian dish and lamb vindaloo for mains...All very good taste.

The pistachio ice cream was very delicious as a dessert.

Restaurant a bit on the expensive side. Cost around 65$S per person, and we only had two local beers.

If you are in the quay and feel like Indian, it is a good place to go. The atmosphere and music are fun too!"
Not a right place for Vegetarians,"I have been to many places around Quays in Singapore, and didnt find Dabbawala too great in terms of location and food. The choice for vegetarians esp starters is very limited. we had to order both starters of Paneer. Suggest the restaurant to add veg kababs and something of potato etc.
the location is ok amidst lot of there restaurants and not by the river.
the service is good and staff is friendly. Must try there cocktails, they are really good."
"Quick Evening Meal, Great Spot","3rd time here, found myself wanting to go back so that says something with all the choice around. Friendly staff, food good and drink prices not too expensive. Its a balance of Quick Eats and Fine Dining, casual and friendly. Worth a Visit."
"Excellent Food, good atmosphere","Didn't book but had a drink and a table was made ready quickly. Friendly waiters, didn't rush us and gave advice. My husband had a Railwaymans curry which he liked but it was considerably hotter than the one he is used to. I am not really into spicy food so had a Korma which was actually the tastiest I have ever had. We both really enjoyed a side dish of chickpeas dish called Channa chat which was more like a salad served cold. Different but very tasty."
Great Place,"Had Dinner with my wife, the atmosphere was really great. The food was tasty, not too spicy. Good selections for Vegetarian as well. The service was excellent. Nice causal and relaxing place."
Flavor all around!,"We arrived around 7pm and the restaurant was buzzing with energy! We sat outside (which is recommended). We were greeted by the manager who gave us just enough attention throughout the night. My fiancé and I ordered:
> Kingfisher Beers.
>Palak Paneer
>House black Dal (loved how this dish was served)
>Garlic nan
>Tandori style chicken
>Saffron rice
Our service was just right given it was a full house. I've been to India twice, the food here is authentic enough for me! We walked away satisfied and stuffed, I will absolutely come back again!!"
Good indian food,"If you r looking for some good indian food, you can visit this place. Foods are at reasonable rate, ambience is good and staffs are coopertive. It is at river bank which adds to ambience."
"Good food, great location",Went to Dabbbawalla at Robertson Quay with a couple of friends. It was a great experience. On weekends they have a live chat (Indian snack) counter. It is pricey but I guess worth it because of the lovely location.
Delightful slice of India in Singapore,"I loved the food and service at Dabbawalla. Started with an ice cold Kingfisher, crispy bread and chutnies and polite overview of the menu. Began my feast with a lamb Bombay Frankie, followed by the Lamb Korma. The Bombay Frankie is roti like bread; light and flaky surrounding a lively set of fresh vegetables and lovely marinated lamb. The creamy lamb korma absolutely melted.
Both were delicious; not too spicy and really fresh flavours. Staff were great; fun, polite and prompt."
Great Indian food and excellent staff,"I went yesterday at the Dewali celebration. The place is very nice, near the river, and the food it was perfect. I used to order ""butter chicken"" at Indian restaurants, but besides the butter chicken, the waiter recommended us the ""chicken korma"" and I really appreciated it."
Great curry - very tasty,"We arrived as a family and were accommodated inside the restaurant. The staff were very friendly and served drinks and food promptly and efficiently.
The food was delicious."
Amazing Indian food,"One of the most authentic Indian restaurants I found in Singapore. Good selection of vegetarian options. To top it off, they also offer creative cocktails. Staff was very friendly. Don't miss taking a picture in the Rickshaw parked close to the restaurant."
"Friendly staff, Good food!","Friendly staff, good food = great combination.
We had been just declined by restaurant few steps away because it was 9.40 p.m. saying too late for a big order. We had 10 in the group. Dabbawalla-Clark Quay attracted us because we mistook it for a Sri Lankan restaurant. But nevertheless we felt like home the moment we walked in. The staff welcomed us with open arms and said the last order is at 10 p.m. but we can take our time and decide. Even order later if we run short. We had an amazing dinner. went by their recommendation for quantity and ordered biriyani. We ordered Veg and non Veg. Both were equally good.
Atmosphere was lively and jolly. Staff was very warm and impressed us with their update on the 'Dabbawalla' name.
Perhaps a little expensive due to the Clark Quay area pricing, But it is comparative with other restaurants in the area. We were planning to return the next day. But due to our hectic schedule it didn't materialize."
Noisy expensive but Average food,"we were greeted with so loud a music that we thought of ordering aspirins , request to reduce music was met with partial deaf ears . The owners have no concern that there families with young kids.
Regarding food My suggestion is take the train from CLARK Quay to Little India for some value for money food

The food at best was very average not worth the premium you are paying"
Fantastic Indian food,During a week long holiday we chose to eat at Dubbawalla twice. The standard of food would be difficult to match. They were willing to slightly seek curry for personal taste.
Tasty food in a lively atmosphere,"Four of us went for dinner recently at Dabbawalla on Clarke Quay.
Very friendly staff and delicious food served quickly and piping hot.

Their signature Butter Chicken dish was superb, although my keema naan was disappointingly small.

That aside the rest of the food was very tasty, plus the vibrant Saturday night atmosphere made for a very enjoyable meal.

We would definitely return if in the vicinity."
Dinner at clarke dabbawala,"Went for a family dinner to dabbawala at clarke . Good food abd best part was that they were constantly playing punjabi music. So good fun it was. There were more eating places around the area. Initially we were sitting inside and then we came outside.
The sitting places are quite comfy, some sofas with cushions and the remaining ones were wooden chairs.
A good evening spent."
Awesome North Indian food in a lovely location,"We have been fans of Curry Culture for many years. And we’re excited when it underwent an update and emerged as Dabbawalla. The restaurant has a great vibe and friendly staff. We go there for the small bites and appetizers (mostly Indian street food). The curries are excellent too, though sometimes a tad spicy for me. But the restaurant is happy to make food per our spice preference. I recently stopped by for a paneer Frankie and chaas. Most satisfying meal!"
Amazing Indian Food and Drinks,"My family and I went to Dabbawala recently. Really good food. Everything was served hot and within 10-15 minutes of the order.
The Black Lentil with Tandoori was one of the best I have had. The lassis were the right consistent and not to sweet. Their ginger lassi is worth trying. In desserts we tried Pista Kulfi, which was again delicious.

Highly recommend this place if you are craving good Indian food."
Good food!,"Used TripAdvisor to find an Indian restaurant near our hotel and found Dabbawalla. We had great food, staff was very nice. Would definitely go again when I’m in Singapore!"
A must visit or Try the food,Amazing thing happened when i was in Singapore for the firsttime. I read this Dabbawala and i make the memories of Mumbai's dabbawalla. Amazing food with nice price. Specially if even it is pricy we Indians generally don't see it.Thanks kumar for the reference.
Great eating place for delicious Fusion Indian food,Dabbawala is a great place for Indian fusion food. Offers variety of Indian street food served with a twist in serving style. Has both indoor & outside seating options with live street food stall as well.
Usual catch-up,"This is the place to go for Indian cuisine. We’re here for a catch-up just before our friend flew for his holiday. Great lamb, chicken briyani, naan and desserts and not forgetting the outstanding hospitality. Will be back again and recommend to friends!"
Average food,I thought it was very expensive and not at all value for money. The chicken biryani was really orange in colour hope it was saffron and no artificial colouring was used. The black dal also had orange colour . All in all did not meet my expectations and the money I paid.
Best Indian in Singapore,My Husband and I went here when we were craving Indian . True authentic North Indian food. Super yummy. Meat was so tender. Service was brilliant. Staff are very attentive and friendly. Highly recommended.
"Great food, excellent service","Great and tasty Indian food. Rich and spicy curries. Very Good and friendly service.
Don’t expect an Indian atmosphere."
High quality curry,"Travelling in Singapore for 10 days with colleagues from Bangalore. Decided to try Dabbawalla as it was close to the hotel we stayed. Glad we did as it was a very enjoyable meal. Tried the chicken tikka masala which is usually served mild spicy in the UK, this one more was more medium spicy but still fine for me and went down well with the naan, rice and Kingfisher.
My Indian colleagues had good things to say about the meal and we returned at a later date to try more. Recommended."
Lamb curry was awesome,The lamb was phenomenal. They have chaat on the menu but that was below par. Highlight was that they serve Kingfisher beer. Staff was very pleasant. Service was timely. Overall good experience
Very good Indian food in Robertson Quay,I stumbled across this restaurant while walking through my favorite area of Robinson Quay the other evening. I noticed that the reviews weren't bad and decided to try it out with a friend of mine. We were pleasantly surprised as the food was very good and the service was even better. The music was a little bit loud for us but overall the food quality and the environment and the attitude of the staff really want us over and we had a wonderful evening. I strongly recommend this restaurant for those that have not been there. It's newer and you might not have heard of it but it is definitely worth a try.
Good Good Noisy... Super Staff,The restaurant is on Robertson Quay and a walk from the Millennium hotels. The ambience is nice with outdoor seating arrangement too. The choice of food is good. Portions are also good. The service was quick and courteous. All in all good. Washrooms need to be clean too.
Indian food near havelock road,I was just roaming around to get good Indian joint near by my hotel and saw this place. Place looks typical Indian restaurant style furniture and decor. I was greeted by mr rajeshwar he was very friendly and helpful. Food taste was good if in singapore u can’t expect to much oily and spice but chicken biryani and tandoori chicken which ordered was meeting the Indian taste buds.)
Go for the vindaloo... stay for the Naan,"I stumbled across Dabbawalla in TripAdvisor when seeking Indian in the Robertson / Clarke Quay area. The vindaloo was quite good and ability to adjust spiciness makes this friendly to more people. I had the chance to get vindaloo in Goa, and it almost blew my head off. I went with a modest 5 of 10 here and was well satisfied with the level. Going back, I would try a little higher.
What pleasantly surprised me was the naan. They were freshly baked and delivered quickly to the table. Their specialty black daal was also a good choice to balance the heat of the vindaloo. Add in a few Kingfishers and this was a really good meal."
Awesome food,"I am in Singapore currently for the last 4 days and have visited dabbawala restaurant daily for dinner, it is indeed a very wonderful place to have delicious food along with a express service"
Father's Day Eve Celebration,"Great setting for celebrating Father's Day Eve at Dabbawalla. The place has a good decor as it is filled with paintings of Mumbai and Dabbawallas inside the restaurant including Bollywood. It also has good decoration of drinks on the other side. The food was very good right from their vegetable platter to main course. They have a good variety of drinks as well. Try the popular Merlot wine from Australia (its not on the menu, but you can still ask for it) or have the Old Monk rum. The desserts were also tasty especially the chocolate brownie with ice-cream and the gulab jamun as well. Although I felt the place is expensive. Overall a great experience and celebration."
Amazing vibe and service!,"I wanted Indian and something new, so here I was on my way to Dabbawala! My first impression was how laid back the vibe of the place was and how simple the menu was. I hate over complicated menus. All clean and crisp like the font it was printed in. Within minutes though I was afraid there wasn't anything in the appetizers that was both vegan and gluten free. But our server Chobey made sure I realized we were going to be well looked after, and we absolutely were - with the delicious customized food and his jokes the entire evening! I'd give staff 11/10 because Chobey is such a star, food 9/10, the casual chilled vibe 9/10 and the service 10/10 and my entire experience 10/10! Do not miss out on the cocktails here because it most definitely was a little burst of India in my mouth. Thank you Dabbawalla for the amazing experience we had and Chobey for being such a brilliant hands-on host."
"Good taste, great ambience and setup!","Went for dinner on a Saturday with friends and family.

The ambience is upbeat and appealing, retro yet modern. We loved each and every song played there!

We ordered Vegetable platter in starters. Paneer was fresh. Broccoli had flavours but what stood out were the mushrooms. It had great taste. Though for a platter I felt the quantity was bit less. Peanut was spicy, loved it. Green Chutney was refreshing.
Chana masala, Paneer gravy, Dal in the bucket were delicious. We also had brownie with ice cream and that made the overall outting great.

Service was fast and attentive. Butter rotis were served without butter, which was quickly fixed upon highlighting.

Price - Is decent for the food and ambience offered, comparable to any good Indian restaurant in Singapore.

Location is amazing and after dinner you can have a nice walk around the quay area.

PS: We did not feel heavy after having stomach full dinner which reflects good quality cooking!"
Pricy and close early on Sunday afternoon,"I and my friend went to this restaurant for lunch on Sunday. Restaurant is located in the middle of Robertson Walk and next to Japanese restaurant. We ordered vegetarian dishes (including curry), plain naan bread, mango lassi and chai tea which costs nearly $80 including service charge.
Food was okay but not good as other Indian restaurants in Little India. Mango lassi came with metal cup and did not taste mango much.
This restaurant was trying to close around 2pm on Sunday so, do not recommend for weekend late lunch."
Great Indian in interesting quay location,As can be expected there are a lot of Indian cuisine choices in Singapore. Curry culture was recommended by the concierge at the 4 seasons. The quality of food and extra special attention to service made for a lovely evening..
Expensive but very good,"Visited Dabbawalla for dinner. Service was attentive. A good menu with choices for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Food was tasty, freshly prepared to order. I really enjoyed the Hyderabadi baingan and aloo parantha."
"Average Indian food, expensive but decent amvience","Food quality is below par, ambience and seating is great but overall expensive for the quality and taste"
Energetic Indian bistro,Great location and upbeat energetic ambience without it being overbearing. Service was very friendly and efficient. Food was very good but just short of being great and somewhat overpriced. Overall though a very enjoyable experience and highly recommended.
Dabble in the masala cola at Dabbawalla,"Energetic Bollywood music and friendly staff welcome you to this place. Very good curries. You can adjust the excellent Vindaloo to your preferred level of spiciness; I am grateful the charming Michelle (with the nose ring) convinced me to order 4 (out of 10) instead of 8, otherwise it would have been a case of whateverwalla revenge. Portions tend to be small, so parties of 2-4 can order lots of dishes without risk of food coma."
