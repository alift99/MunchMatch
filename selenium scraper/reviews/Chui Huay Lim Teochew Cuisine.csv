"Ratings of food, services etc","The overall service was excellent, staff was very helpful and food quality is exceptionally superb. Will definitely recommend friends to go there for meals especially for special occasion."
Family Dinner at Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine,"The food menu is comprehensive, and the food are of course fresh and yummy.

But there is a slight roam for improvement for example we order a fish which is about 700g as informed by the waiter then when we order lobester he recommend about 1.2 kg which I think in my opinion for a family of 4 is overkill.

The waiter can consider recommending a balance of both for example if you want a large portion of fish then you have a smaller portion of lobester or vice versa and let the customer to decide

But overall is a good dining experience for me and my family

Thank you"
PRICE IS ON A HIGER SIDE,"The restaurant is clean. However, we were 'shock' to find out the kailan we ordered was SGD32? Overall the menu price is on the higher side."
Great Teochew Food,"Did not realize that menu has been changed, last time I went (before covid), crabs were available, now have to pre-order. Which was a bummer as it was my birthday celebration and I really wanted to eat crabs. So left feeling unsatisfied. Food was ok, decent enough, but still wanted the crabs."
Dishes sold out by second seating,"I was with my family for their second seating at 7.45pm. We wanted to order their cold crab and goose web, but they were all sold out. We were so disappointed and the explanation we received was because we are at the second seating hence the items are sold out. How is that explanation valid when all these are classic dishes when you go to a Teochew restaurant? Food was mediocre, nothing came out that made us wow. Lastly, as this was a birthday occasion celebration, I have asked to place my cake in the fridge, but it seems that it was not done so as the cake did not have any condensation after we asked to take home to eat as we were full after the meal."
Food review,"Overrated restaurant with small portions , not worth value. Environment is not comfortable and food is disappointing"
Service below expectation,"This is supposed to be one of the best Teochew food restaurants in Singapore but sadly, the service is below par. IN the first place, there were 4 of us but the amount of food that was ordered was way too much. We had to pack 2 dishes home. The captain should have alerted us that we could have ordered too much as being too full makes the food less enjoyable. With the cold crab signature dish, the only way to eat this with with hands. Previously, bowls of water with lemon would be provided to wash the hands before drying with the towel. Apparently, this practice has ceased. Finally, when asked for a small plate for chilli sauce, the waiter asked one of the guests to use the cradle of the spoon for it. It is time for the management to wake up and spruce up on the service!"
Good Food,Friendly service staff especially Yan Han. However place is a little crowded. Food is served piping hot
Good as usual,"Food was good & very authentic. Service was great. Love it that there was tea before & after meal. Tea cup was unique & pretty. Made the customer felt important which is true for service industry. Since I am at it, could Jpot be brought back? Miss it so so much."
Superb Teochew cuisine,Tasty authentic Teochew food not always come by....Chui Huay Lim certainly shines in Teochew cuisine and the best I had with my family.....very delicious and a satisfying one...so glad to find it....and the good customer service certainly adds to the wonderful experience.
Decent food with decent service,"Booked a private room with my clients last Thurs 21 Jul 22.

Booking: Very smooth, I called earlier to confirm a room. No deposit needed, which is great as my company does not allow claiming of deposits, which unfortunately more restaurants are doing so since COVID period. Was also allowed to do a tour in private room, and I was glad that the room was equipped with projector, white screen and even a karaoke set.

Food: Ordered the 6 pax set meal B6 at $583++, which contains Teochew Classic Platter, Braised Shark's Fin Soup with Conpoy and Crab Meat, 5-Head Abalone Braised with Spinach in Oyster Sauce, Teochew Steamed Promfret, Braised Duck with Beancurd, Wok Fried 'Kway Teow' with Diced 'Kai Lan' and Preserved Radish and Teochew Glutinous Rice Balls as desserts. Food was not overly complicated, with great taste for each dish. Portions were more than sufficient for us.

Service: Service was prompt, when I asked the servers to bring the food out, it was done in 5mins. Grateful for your staff for the flexibility, as I had a last min addition (to 7 pax), and you guys allowed the same set meal but with food enough for 7 pax (Of course price adjusted for 7 pax). The servers also attended to our needs (e.g. helped us portion to 7 bowls for certain dishes) and continuously poured tea for my clients. Just one small thing, please debone the fish as you split into 7 portions, my client had a plate that was half full of bones. Overall satisfied with the service.

Ambience: Thank god there was no music played in the private room, so we could talk without raising our voices. AV equipment was also working, when my colleague was doing a presentation.

Location: Unfortunately place is out of the way of MRTs and buses, thus we drove there. Another unfortunate thing is that there is no complimentary parking for private room guests (Dare say we spent alot more money than those at main dining hall). Parking all right at $3.50 at 3hrs.

Will be back with different clients in the future!"
Will never visit again,"Despite price hike, food quantity and quantity left much to be desired. Inflation plus shrinkflation, double whammy. Service even worse, ordered cold crabs & was the first dish served. We needed time to savour the crabs, but restaurant continued to serve other dishes. Told staff to put a hold first, allow us to finish the crabs, clean our messy hands before we continue with other dishes & staff agreed. However, the ‘put on hold’ was not to stop cooking the rest of the dishes, but simply to leave those dishes aside allowing them to turn cold. We ordered shark’s fins, the soup had already evaporated quite a bit because of the candle fire beneath the bowl keeping it hot. And when we told the staff this shouldn’t be the way the serve, she shrugged off saying “it is not my responsibility & I will get my manager to talk to you”. No manager came as expected. We were supposed to be served a pre-meal & post-meal Chinese tea, ended up only having the pre-meal one, no post-meal tea served. Getting attention from staff also huge challenge. The service button on the table was simply a prop, u pressed few times still no staff in sight. Why are we paying 10% service charge ? Not getting any service. Throughout the meal we helped ourselves to the tea, no staff poured the tea for us. Anyway, so much said, that would be the last dining at this restaurant, will never visit again."
First time to this highly rated restaurant,"Excellent food overall. Service was below average, and slow. The tables layout was not conducive for family gathering; too close to other tables. The seafood mee sua, Ngoh Hiang to me were very good. The salted egg yolk Boston Loster was a little too dry for my liking. The steam white pomfret was a little too big for table of 3. Overall good experience."
Saturday Meal,"Had a Lovely meal at this Teochew restaurant near Newton. The ngoh hiang was very nice as well as the boiled prawns. Today the mee sua was also good. However as the restaurant was crowded, we had to wait a while for our food."
Restaurant is noisy,"The moment I was brought to my table, I find the restaurant too noisy. My table of 2 pax was situated next to 2 big tables of 10 pax. These 20 pax were already seated when I reached my table and they talked throughout their meal. Until I left, both tables were still there and still talking. It would be good if groups of 10 pax can be put in VIP rooms especially if they intend to talk a lot.
Another point is the restaurant has ONLY 3 tables for 2 pax!
A 3rd point is service was slow. I usually finish my lunch in less than 1 hour there, but that day I waited very long for my only two dishes, causing me to pay $5 for parking. Right, parking at this club is EXPENSIVE! The club refuses to reduce the parking charge despite providing feedbackany times. The carpark was not even always full, so don't understand why the management refuses to lower the parking rate."
"Poor service, forgot our food",Forgot one of our dishes and kept telling us it was being cooked / almost ready. Very bad service. We waited 30 mins (after finishing the second last dish). No apology from staff either.
Unhygienic,"Crockery not washed well lipstick Stains on teacups, service staff lacking and waited almost 1hour before our order was served"
Good service,Very attentive and pleasant staff. Great dining experience except the suckling pig was not up to my husband’s expectation .
Standard of food is consistently good,"This is a place I regularly return to for different reasons.
1. The food is good.
2. Weekdays are good as less of a crowd.
3. This was one of my late parents favourite eateries and so many happy memories are associated with this place.

Actually when reviewing any eatery, you only need the first reason."
birthday celebration,"We went there to celebrate my father's 75th birthday. It was a lovely evening filled with excellent food and fellowship. The service was impeccable, everyone was attentive and very friendly. Great evening spent at Chui Huay Lim!"
Teochew Food Good !,Food is good and we are happy with their services ! Good place with Teochew Food ! Price is reasonable too !
Great Teochew Cuisine,"It was a birthday treat. Had my fill of lovely, Teochew sharks fin, steamed HK style Soon Hock, oyster omelets and bird's nest. Service was great too!"
My mum’s 80th birthday celebration,"1. Despite bringing my own birthday cake and letting the staff/captain know in advance before dinner, nobody wished my mum happy birthday when serving which typically a restaurant like that would in other places, especially when I ordered the longevity buns as well.
2. I asked how many of the classic platter contains prawn as my sister is allergic, a waitress told us only 1 when 3 of the 4 items on the platter have prawns in it."
CNY Dinner,Overall satisfied with the service and foods. Can improve on the fries rice as abit oily and dessert Abit sweet
Must try,"Best suckling pig!the fried kwetiaw also delicious,friendly service,need to book in advance,good place visit with family"
Consistent,"The main restaurant is under renovation and a pop up restaurant is relocated to the second floor ball room. The restaurant was full and understaffed when we got there for dinner. The service was lacking attention and normal servicing! The food taste is still good. We ordered their 4 treasures appetiser, salted egg prawns, a whole roasted piglet, poached kailan and ornee (yam) for dessert. Price is mid and high range. The restaurant has been consistent and popular with locals."
No carpark coupons,"It’s surprisingly the staff did not give carpark coupon after requested.

The vege was very expensive, small amount of gailan cost 30 dollars, there’s little oyster in fried oyster omelette. The oyster not fresh at all.

I genera, the food not so satisfying and the price was over! Not worthy at all."
staff service,"Below expectation this time, started lunch very slow and suddenly catching up too fast before we finished our foods, next dish appear and table so small to handle the over crowded table. For the promotion dish listed on discount of 20% for cold crabs but was not informed that our order doesn’t entitle to. For the fairest for customer they should highlight to us ( we actually preferred the ginger vision) that enjoy the discount. Disappointed , we need to call for service all the times…. actually we like this resturant . Hopefully they would improve their service."
Food Sharing Experience,"The dishes we selected all taste well. Very happy with their quality consistency. We will come back to try other dishes again in the next few months. Keep up with the good work, guys!"
Good food as always at my favourite Teochew cuisine restaurant,"The food is good and value for money through the use of a $100 birthday voucher. The only bugbear is the long intervals between dishes served and according to one of the serving staff, is due to manpower shortage."
"Good Teochew Food, but quite expensive","Generally good quality food with fresh ingredients. However, there are other restaurants where I can get equivalent for lower prices."
Great Teochew food,This is one of the very few consistently good teochew food joint. Great food quality and excellent taste. Very commendable is the excellent service from Miss Chen Hai Yen who took our order and served us well throughout. Prices are a little pricey but who can complain if it comes with quality and great taste.
Dinner at Chui Huay Lim,"First time visiting this restaurant. Sumptuous dinner, with fresh seafood. Definitely will return back to try other dishes."
Average Restaurant,First time dining here. Crabs not available due to no demand. Need to preorder but was not told when making reservation. quite a few missing items not available on that night. But overall food still not bad.
The best authentic Teochew restaurant in Singapore,"We celebrated Mothers' Day for 3 mummies and Birthday of my grandma at Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine. Dinner started with kung fu tea served in beautifully crafted Koi teacups. Food served is hot and fresh, plated fantastically on unique chinesewares. Their teochew steam pomfret brings your memories back to the 80s where this is dish is usually served during wedding dinners.

Overall we had a fantastic experience, the staff were friendly and chatty. If only the price could be 15% - 20% lower I would make this a frequent place to visit."
Fellowship Dinner,Yummy delicious dishes. Service Staff very friendly & knowledgeable - giving good recommendations 👍🤩😋👏👏👏 Prices reasonable 🙋‍♀️
Pleasant Dinner,"Had birthday dinner with family.
What we tried -
1. Drunken chilled prawns - refreshingly good. Not marinated in the more common Hua Diao Jiu alone. Recommended.
2. Braised duck was deboned and plated with tofu. Does not come with head, neck, wings or feet. Seasoning is a bit on the light and healthy side this time round, but ok.
3.Braised shark's fin soup with canopy and crab was the weakest. It was the starchy type of soup. The consistency of the soup broke down if left on the table for some time. Started starchy, ended watery. Perhaps due to the high cost of shark's fins, there was not much ingredients in the soup, which did not lend to a positive mouth field and experience.
4. Beancurd braised with seafood in claypot was well-done. Importantly, ingredients were generously sized which reflected the fact that this was a restaurant and not a tze char stall in a food court.
5. Teochew Oyster Omelette Gooey. A good attempt at a crispy crust, which worked when we ate it hot immediately on service. However, at $14 a serving, more than twice that of the average hawker stall, this won't beat many of the seasoned hawkers.
6.Teochew Crystal Dumplings (Yam paste). Very well done desert. Fine yam paste. Not too sweet. Discernable thin crystal skin of the perfect texture and chewiness.
7.Yam Paste with pumpkin and gingko nuts. The 73 year old Teochew at my table failed to taste the presence of pumpkin. Can do with marginally more yam paste and a stronger shallot taste in the oil.
They charged me for an extra pax for tea. 4 Tea, 3 Rice. Should this not be obvious to the service staff?

Overall, decent."
Simply great!,Fantastic service and food! Had a family dinner and everybody was happy including my picky little eaters. Just go and eat there and you will understand.
Great Teochew food...from,"Great Teochew food...from their cold crab, baby suckling pig, appetiser plate, to their lobster Teochew porridge, braised duck, scallops with broccoli. End with their nien gao and onne (yam) paste. Price on the high end. Has a room to ourselves for 7 of us, thus service was a dedicated server. Price is on a higher plain!"
Very Poor Service,"We are long time customers of this restaurant. The service today has deteriorated tremendously.

I gave 3 star is for the food. The quality and variety of the food are very good despite the poor customer service.

Please improve your service standards to keep customer happy.

Sandy"
Good Teochew food,"Good Teochew food at this restaurant. The cold crab, baby suckling pig, the Teochew style goose (duck) and 4 dish appetiser are all excellent dishes to have. Celebrating a birthday must go with their prosperity bun. Service is kind of slow and after many apologies all the food finally came. Nice presentation, good tasting and a popular restaurant with the locals. Price is on the higher end."
Early reunion dinner,"Superb service, great food, happy faces around the table. I was so pleased that I am going to make another reservation for the 15th day of CNY"
One of the finest Teochew restaurants in town!,"One of the finest Teochew restaurants in town. The food is tasty and authentic. The appetiser that comes with prawn balls, prawn roll, braised duck meat with tofu and frozen pork trotter were great except the duck meat kind of too hard to chew.. need to braised longer but the braised tofu is fantastic! The usual steamed pomfret is awesome..quite balance taste of the broth! The fish maw soup is kind of average. The one you shouldn’t miss is the fried oyster omelette.. it is is really good and so so yummy! Crispiness with slightly charred while oyster is still not overly cooked. The traditional fried preserve radish Kway Teow with asparagus kind of too bland but with good wok hei. Service is attentive and have a great ambience!"
Birthday dinner,The service was good and the food was fantastic! Must try conrad rispy fried sea cucumber is very nice and crispy
Great food and services.,"Food standard is still great and services is even better. Love the crispy oyster omelette and platters. If you love a authentic Teochew premium food, this is definitely the place. All thumbs up!"
Unexpectedly long wait between dishes,"Food quality superb and pricing very reasonable, however my last visit is marred by unexpectedly long wait between dishes, even the staff handled the protocol for entrance formalities in a chaotic manner with queue-cutting rampant"
Great food and excellent service,Great food and excellent service. Great food and excellent service. Great food and excellent service.
Excellent dinner experiences at Chui Huay Lim,"I chose to dine here on both 28 and 30 November.,with my friends and my sisters respectively. Turned out to be excellent choice. The month specials of Yellow roe crab meat wrapped in TianJin cabbage & Spinach Sauce and theTeohew style Yam & Salted Eg Yok Mochi(latter for dessert) were super. We had our usual steamed Threadfin tail, braised duck, Oyser omellette and Fried Mee Pok. On the second night, we had Half a roast suckling pig and Fish Maw with cabbage soup, and our usual favourites of Ngoh Hiang, Liver roll, Chui Jia Pau. Manager Teng LiChing (yes, that's her real name) was super friendly and efficient. HIghly recommended. Note: Due to Covid restrictions atmosphere was a little serious, hence the ""very Good"" rating only. on this section."
Great Quality Teochew Food!,Enjoyed a good quality Teochew meal at the Chui Huay Lim Club. Portions were good and the food very tasty. Only minus point is the speed of delivery which was very slow between each dish. We were served one at a time. But overall a good experience.
Good Food and Service,It has been an enjoyable experience. Food was great. Ambience was great. Service was great. Would recommend!
Terrible service,"Server was bad - spill tea but did not notice n candle was extinguished . Food served must be chef preference, cannot be flexible."
Enjoyable meal.,Enjoyable meal. Good quality food n good service. Will try out other dishes next time. More value set menu will be good
Authentic Teochew food,the food was good. atmosphere is nice and cosy. location is not convenient if you are not driving and will have to grab there.
Good experience,The food was nice and serving of food was very fast. Service is good as well. Captain was good in gauging the good ordered.
Authentic Teochew cuisine in an old fashioned setting away from the city crowd,Authentic & refined Teochew cuisine showcasing fresh ingredients and traditional cooking methods. Lunch porridge (Teochew “muay”) menu is highly recommended!
"Good Food, Good Ambiance, Good Service","The ""check-in"" is simple and my friends are I sat at a table in a corner. Its cosy and we were able to talk without much chatters from the other tables. Food is delicious as usual. The staff were also attentive."
Overall experiences is avaerage,"Food & environment is good. Captain serving us is professional. However, our welcoming can be better. My 3rd times there & services have never improved. Should I visit them the 4th time? TBD"
Catchup Lunch,Haven't been here for quite sometime so it was a good catchup with friends and family. Food is still great and service is impeccably good.
A Meal After a long Lockdown,"Quiet and fuss-free meal. Menu shrunked but quality still intact. Service is efficent. Would rather have a physical menu but I guess during such times, an electronic one will do."
Superb Food and Service,Brought family for Father’s Day Dinner and we were very impressed by the service rendered. There’s a guy in black coat who has been very attentive to our table but I did not manage to get his name and also Ms Then Li Chin. Thank you for the service given to us. Food is really good and portion is great. We left with a happy stomach.
Had a lovely lunch today ordering,Had a lovely lunch today ordering the popular dishes and more. I felt the prawn with chives and asparagus with scallops were a bit overpriced at $32 for the small portion. Overall food and service were good. Only disappointment was the deep fried yam sticks dessert not being available on weekend.
below average,A little disappointed with the teochew food. Service was average though the restaurant was barely half full.
Authentic Teo chew restaurant.,Authentic Teo chew restaurant. Food are all good. Minus one star for service and price. Would expect a little better service for the price pay.
Lovely family dinner,"Happy that this restaurant did not adopt the pushy tactic and as we had dinner during the Lunar New Year, did not have the mandatory time-limit or the compulsory Chinese New Year set-menu. Food, service was very nice although the stir fry broccoli with scallop tasted quite ordinary."
Lunch at Chui Huay Lim,"Have heard a lot about this restaurant that specialized in Teochew cuisine. Taking an opportunity in attending a calligraphy exhibition at the club (by the way, the club support many such art exhibitions), I invited my friend for a lunch at the restaurant on a Saturday. The external and internal look of the club house, where the restaurant is located is excellent and it gives an ""exclusive"" feeling of the restaurant even though it is open to the public. The setting and ambiance of the restaurant matches the club house so it is not out of place. Surprisingly not too crowded on a Saturday afternoon and we were given a table immediately. Staff are friendly and know the menu very well and able to give us recommendation and the amount of food we ordered. Most importantly the food is great, our main dish was the crab with vermicelli in a claypot and it was cooked to perfection. Price is a little on the high side, but fully justifiable if taking the overall experience of ambiance, service and food quality into consideration."
Lunch on 4 Jan 2020,Half of the dishes we ordered took a long time to be served. We were kept waiting for the other half of the dishes and the lunch stretched over our expectation. It was only after we enquired a couple of times about the unserved dishes that it was looked into. It appeared the unserved dishes weren't even prepared. The rice and porridge which we were eating and keeping so they cld accompany the unserved dishes had turned too cold by the time the long awaited dishes were served. It marred the experience and we were disappointed.
Must try,We had the set lunch for 10 pax. Was very good especially the fish maw soup and braised duck. Very packed on weekends. The fried oyster omelette though is an authentic teochew cuisine but it was not great.
Best Teochew Chinese Cuisine in Singapore,"Housed in Chui Huay Lim club, this restaurant is open to public. There is so much parking space inside and its Teochew Food is fresh and superb. We started with steam crab that was chilled, and it was so fresh. Our steam fish were so yummy. The yam paste dessert was so tasty. Service was excellent."
Always my parents’ favourite,Not many Teochew restaurants left in Singapore. This is one of my parents’ favourite restaurants. Always packed but service always good.
No more my favourite Teochew restaurant,"When CHL opened its doors some years ago, it was my go to restaurant for a year. The restaurant is within walking distance from my residence,the food and service were good plus the promotion keep me going back. A few years later, both management and kitchen staff changed. The food was still good but the prices went up. I just had lunch with 3 friends after not patronising the restaurant for a few years.
We ordered the basic items including the cold platter,goey oyster omelette and kuay teow. The popular oyster omelette was a let down but the others were up to standard. Scanning the menu,the prices were indeed high for the top end items. It looks unlikely l will return in the immediate future as there are many good restaurants offering high end Teochew cuisine"
Slightly above average quality food but pricey,"Nice ambience, great and attentive service, also speedy. However, food quality has declined somewhat over the years, still above average but some dishes are clearly average at best. For instance, the vermicelli crab, crab was tasty but the vermicelli was bland. Cabbage soup also overly ex, at $16.80/pax before taxes, the serving size is only a rice bowl quantity, and 3 out of 5 servings did not have scallop! Overall, it was worth a try if you haven't tried decent teochew food before, but be prepared to accept a few holes in your wallet."
Celebration,"This Teochew restaurant has been our to-go venue whenever on family's celebration and chinese new year reunion dinner/lunch. Being a teochew family, we only patronise places that serves authentic teochew dishes."
Birthday Dinner with family at Chui Huay Lim,"The food was good, especially the cold crab. We were recommended the Teochew tea by the captain and it was a good recommendation: the tea was fragrant and very pleasant, went well with the food. Service standard was high. Overall the price was very reasonable."
Good quality but pricey,"We’ve been to this restaurant many times because the Teochew food is refined and consistent, and service is good. The service staff are attentive. It is a favourite with my mother-in-law and eldest daughter. My gripe is the price."
A Chill and Nice Sunday Lunch,Service was prompt and attentive yet not intrusive. Food was well prepared with good quantity and quality
"Awesome food, good service.",One of the best oyster omelette n crispy sea cucumber! Ambience was nice with good friendly service.
Great food,Great food and excellent service. This is the second time we come back within a week. It was a surprise that this place is so crowded on a weekday evening.
Good Service Good Food,The aunties serving us were friendly. Dishes are well presented and taste is great. RecommendIng to others
Still One of the Best Teochew Cuisine,Have not been back for about a year and was happy to return. Everything is still great. The braised duck with toufu is done very nicely and our favorite dish here. We also had a small bowl of fishball and fish maw - totally fresh and homemade. Tried the Sri Lankan crab for the first time here and was not disappointed. We topped it off with seafood fried mee suah. What a nice lunch! Service was great and reservation system all worked as expected.
Best sea cucumber,Wonderful service and authentic TEOCHEW food. My guests were super impressed but the crispy sea cucumber!
Great food,Ordered the $448 ++ set for 4 . Love the shatksfin soup very flavourful. The food are not salty but yet fragrant n fresh
Experience was good.,Overall the experience was good. Food and service was good. Price wise is not really value for money. A bit pricey. Atmosphere is a bit nosy when the crowd starts coming in for lunch.
Teochew so-so,Price wise is average but Taste also average nothing special. Some of the waitress no speak english. I still found paradise teochew better than this. But their seafood have lots of variety compare to other restaurants as their are under jumbo a well known seafood restaurant in Singapore.
Good quality food as always,"Delicious Teochew food. Restaurant is a family favourite. We love the duck, the fried Kway Teow and the Hei Cho. Daughter had cold crab this time. Crab was small but the roe was fairly generous. Must try for quality Teochew cuisine."
Great Teochew food,The suckling pig is a stand out. extremely well done. The only hiccup was he trio egg with Chinese spinach - it only came with 2 kinds of egg.
Overpriced sub-par food,"Live prawns were mushy, not fresh at all! Kailan cost $40!! More expensive than all my meat ( duck/chicken /prawn/ pork) dishes! It’s ridiculous!! 8pax $508!!"
One disgruntled customer,"Beware a male manager there; he was not unpleasant, just unfriendly. I was looking forward to having oyster omelette and cold crabs, the must-haves there. The Teochew restaurant’s food had always been tasty and nicely varied and the service efficient and friendly. On a recent Sunday dinner booked for first seating at 6.20 pm, we were told by the male manager we couldn’t order the oyster omelette as there were already too many orders and they couldn’t cope. A short while later we decided to try again to ask for the oyster omelette and this time a lady captain readily took our order. Responding to my feedback, their customer service the following day said that as they had experienced an overwhelming request for the oyster omelette, they were hesitant to take on additional order (mine?) to save customers waiting. I am still pondering why for a renowned restaurant its manager did not bother to monitor the kitchen process and get back to us that they could actually accommodate our order. We had also ordered cold crabs, but were eventually told they were not serving cold crabs that night as the supply was not up to standard. Not their fault then, but that added to a dissatisfying dinner experience at CHL."
Great food and service,"Great food and service! the classic dishes (goose stew and ngor hiang) were excellent, as expected. Fantastic service. The iberico pork was a great fusion dish."
Good food,"Signature dishes to go for when recommended by staffs: FriedNgoh Hiang, Braised Duck, Oyster Omelette, Fermented Bean Chicken, Seafood Fried Mee Sua really different to Cantonese food which is usually oily and salty."
A hidden gem for great Teochew food!,"One of the best (and few) restaurants serving authentic Teochew fare. Great braised goose, steamed pomfret, oyster omelette and kway teow with kai lan and preserved radish. Service is friendly. Located in the old Teochew clan association building, it has a different vibe from most restaurants."
2nd Back Time Back But...,"Came here on Father's Day for 6pm slot.

Had little hiccup during ordering as can't confirm availability of food items after a few times.

Upset when we knew Pork Ribs sold out and Oyster Omelette unable to order due to huge crowd.

Out of my orders, Spinach Skin Beancurd Braised with Crab Meat and Wok Fried ‘Mee Sua’ with Seafood are nice."
great service,"Was pleased to find that service improved with this visit. Wait staff were attentive, friendly, knowledgeable in recommending dishes."
you can not miss CHUI HUAY LIM,"the service is really good, they change plates quite often, and always efficient in delivering ordered food. the seafood is so fresh and at very reasonable price. can't wait to go there again."
Service is always excellent but ...,"The service personnel probably had sales target and tried to sell us lobster the moment we sat down. Chiu Chow food can be simple and nice. I go to this restaurant in high frequency, with very limited (max. 1 hour) ... to enjoy simple good Chiu chow food."
"Most dishes excellent to great, EXCEPT Braise Duck - terrible..","My Teochew family of 7 had lunch - we had 8 dishes, all rated delicious to excellent EXCEPT braised duck.
The duck Had strong “refrigerated” taste.. we ate most of the Tau foo but left the duck.. gave feedback but nothing was done.. no apologies or whatsoever..
Disappointed..."
Good food but pricey,Private rooms come with karaoke and service was pretty good for a Saturday night. Food was reasonably good but the price was a little too high for this club setting. Most club eateries are known for wallet-friendly restaurants.
Satisfying,"We had a satisfying and good dinner with the must order cold crab, shark fin, goose and bean IRD then vegetables. Nice"
Great occasion with family,"The food was great, oyster omelette was perfect, worth the wait.

The prawn with chive was also very nice, a-bit disappointment was the steam pomfret, over cooked and the dishes are on the salty side

Overall great experience, my family loves the foods

Do not order the caipo kuayteow, just plain noodle and yet costs $27, not worth, the Mee Sua taste better and cost $22"
Good food with good ambience!,"The service is fast and the staff is attentive. Also, the food is very quality and delicious! Will definitely come back again!"
Authentic and good Teochew Cuisine,"Restaurant serves Authentic and Good Teochew Food and good service. Prices is abit steep, but understandable as it is a restaurant. Good place for events."
