Lunch@Straits Kitchen,"there was wide selection of food; spread from Indian, Chinese & Malay cuisines. Love the cosy ambience and super friendly staffs"
well done,"food variety & freshness, overall quality, availability of local cuisines, the atmospheric and ambiance are really fine. Unique and great for bigger gatherings. The price is high and therefore makes this a place that is more suitable for business outings .

I think it is true that you can easily find the individual types of food served here at all corners of Singapore. But the fact that you can simply walk around and pick and choose what you’d like to eat and enjoy the most, helps increase the joy of coming to this place."
Lunchtime,"There are varieties of foods, we are spoiled with many juices including teh tarik, which not all restaurants provide it.We love the foods and ambiance.. we’ll definitely be back again ❤️"
Mix Feeling This Time Round,"It has nothing to do with the service nor the food. However, we were saddened to learnt that Shril Nie, who was one of the gem of Straits Kitchen, has left!

Nevertheless, our visit this time, too, were enjoyable! As usual, Ivy was at her best serving us with her usual flair, anticipating our needs such as our preferred way of grilled satay, drinks (calamansi/orange mix) as well as herbal tea! This time around, we were delighted to know of another staff i.e. Nelson Wong from the kitchen who made and delivered the herbal tea! Excellent!

Really, we are going to miss Straits Kitchen since we were told that it will close for renovation in September 2022. We will come back again in August for the last time before it close the door!

Thank you Straits Kitchen!"
Decent but have lost its sparkles,"Went there to bring my family for a long weekend celebration, our past memories of this place was thar of great local cuisines in a 5 star establishment. This time, satay were still great, chicken rice was probably 1 notch below Chatterbox's std, as well as most dishes. But rojak was overpowering and the crab and chilled prawns were not fresh. 3.5 stars for the food and additional 0.5 star for the place."
Local Delights in a fantastic setting,"Come with your appetite for great local foods. You can choose to start with satay or chendol but you will not be disappointed. India, Chinese, Malay, Laksa and more. Check in advance on which cards have offers here to increase your satisfaction."
Great Staff,The food is generally very good. Good job by all the chefs. Place is nice and the service staff is fantastic!
Good Local food.,Went for hi-tea with a group of friends.Good selection of foods but timing of one and a half hour a bit too short to eat the food variations.
"excellent food quality, nice ambience",first time here. happy to report food variety and quality was excellent! even for an afternoon tea the spread was great and i got myself stuffed. visited on a weekday hence it was not too crowded. will visit again! Sahri (hope i spelt his name correctly) was very accommodative to requests by my family. Staff at the payment/reception counter was patient and courteous. Straits kitchen has a great team!
Wife’s birthday celebrations,"Visited Straits Kitchen last evening for my wife’s birthday celebrations. Food was great as usual, but service from the staff was awesome. Especially that of Shahri Buhari. He was engaging every customer on the dining floor and also often going the extra mile to make every diner comfortable. It was a memorable experience and celebrations for us. Strongly recommend Straits Kitchen to everyone."
"GREAT RAMADAN BUFFET, pricey but same as other hotel…","Great ramadan buffet with everything you want from MEDJOUL dates to Indian to Malaysian to Chinese to seafood…
The experience to be served by someone at the counter isn’t the best, with good safe distancing management
All the juices were served fast and in good quality, try the TEA TARIK, not to sweet for once, loved it
Two thing we didn’t like : the low level maintenance of the carpets and they dirty…for a 5 stars, not a good sign. And the price…"
Excellent!! As usual!,"Came back to Straits Kitchen again on 24th March 2022. Service, as usual, is excellent! Ivy, obviously she knew, have our satay burnt to perfection, without even us ordering!! Thank you Ivy!!

AND, another surprise!!! We were so touched with Vina!!1 We asked him if Straits Kitchen served herbal tea but we were informed that it was not the day where herbal tea is served. Nevertheless, he came back with two full glasses of herbal tea, freshly brew!!! Incredible!!! Though we knew that he is the manager but we never expect such committed-to-excellence manager!!! Kudos to Vina and Grand Hyatt Singapore!!

Not to say the least, Shirl Nie was full of smile at the reception counter and the excellent PR skilled Shahri!! Thank you so much for the attention and courtesy."
Awesome service,"My husband and i had our lunch on 24th of March , Thursday as to celebrate our 16th Wedding anniversary together. We reached at 12pm.Get seated by the host and start to 'recce' ouf food
while deciding, we were approached by the manager name Shahri.By saying Hi and talk about random topic about the pandemic

Overall We had Unexpectedly amazing service from the him.He was so friendly & joyful.He offered us a delicious chocolate cake for our anniversary and took a photo of us.. it was an amazing experienced that we could never forget on our special day!
Will visit again next time;)"
Great atmosphere with good food,"Straits Kitchen is a buffet setting with many good options of India, Chinese, Malay and Indonesian cuisines to choose from. The ambience and the food taste great. The staffs were helpful, courteous, friendly and attentive. recommended!"
Unfriendly and rude reception,The quality of the staff (I think the Supervisor - a fair-skinned woman) at the reception remains to be desired. She was utterly rude when I asked whether a complimentary parking ticket could be spared. I have dined many times in the past and have always encountered polite and helpful staff the recent visit was an exception. Bad experience.
Delicious buffet!,"Straits Kitchen is a buffet setting with many varieties of Asian dishes to choose from. Love the ambience and the food taste great. The staffs were helpful, courteous, friendly and attentive. Halal certified and Highly recommended!"
Review,"restaurant atmosphere was nice, food is pretty nice but it could be better. service is topnotch and the value is that bad"
Average local food with limited selection,"Average local food served in a hotel. Can get better cooking at the local restaurants / cafe. Was disappointed when I saw that the cakes they served for dessert is from a local bakery (taken straight out from the bakery box to the buffet table!) and not baked by the hotel's baker. Was crowded but the staff did a good job trying their best to clear the dishes etc.

Visited to utilize the Hyatt points I have before they expire."
StraightsKitchen,"Generally food was hard and and some were even cold. The spread was not a lot, and there wasn't even sashimi and not to mention oysters. The selection for desserts also quite limited. Overall quite disappointed."
Excellent meal and service @ Straits Kitchen,"Straits Kitchen at the Grand Hyatt, Singapore is our regular and favourite dining spot when we just don't know what we want and want to have the best of everything local. On our first visit long ago, it may not seems much at first glance, compared to huge international buffet spread in many hotels, however, all the different food stations offers selected Malay, Chinese, Indian and Local cuisine at their best. We couldn't even sample all the dishes in one visit. I must say that the satay, along with the roti prata, laksa and Ondeh Ondel is the best that we have had. This is the only buffet in Singapore that includes freshly squeezed orange juice. However, we really miss the steam barramundi very much from long time ago; since the outbreak of Covid-19, the buffet resumed with the fried barramundi instead.

I have to specially commend 2 excellent staffs who never fail to give us very personalised attention, they are Ms. Ivy and Ms. Shirl Nie. We always make advance bookings and we will almost always get to dine at our favourite table. Ivy and Shirl Nie will always welcome us with very warm smile, and they know exactly what our favourite drinks and dishes are and how they are done, especially satay :) Even though this is a self-service buffet, we will get our favourite dishes served first while we are settling down for a nice and relaxed meal.

I hope things don't change after a proposed renovation this year. Keep it up, Straits Kitchen!"
Excellent Service and Tasty Food!!,"Always dine at Straits Kitchen, without fail every month! What made it so special is the attention given to us! We love Shirl Nie, Ivy and even their Manager, Shahri! Excellent PR skills, pleasant personality and great attention to details staff. Grand Hyatt's Management, too, accommodated our request of having herbal tea in their drinks selection !! Kudos to the team! Keep it up! Thank you !"
Food experience,-too pricey -no western selection -food selection average -fruits choice only 3 types -service above average
Overpriced,"To my opinion, the buffet dinner is overpriced with very minimum food selections. I was expecting more selection from the cold seafood area. Most of the food is just okay, nothing wow! My only favourite was the Northen Indian Cuisine. Service staffs were very competent and friendly. Thumbs up for that! Overall, I don’t think I will visit again.
Thank you!"
Not attentive or forgot or just busy.,"I visited Straits Kitchen on 28 Aug 2021 for afternoon tea to celebrate my both twin sisters birthday.

Although the front service staff was polite enough to show us to our table, that is all.

We understand that the period for afternoon tea was 3pm-4.30pm * 1 and half hour, which a bit rush, thus while we made our way to service counter for our food. So we order of warm glasses of water which came only an hour later, after several attempts telling some of the service staff of our request. The food counter staff are not friendly, for a 5*star establishment.

Although the beverages that we order came earlier, all the service staff who came to our table, is for only to clear the plates. So each time they cleared, we reminded them again, and again. I think the restaurant are not short of service staff, there are enough staff to serve for not so full house capacity. I am sure of that, cos when the time comes for the afternoon tea session to end, several service staff came to our table to remind us few times that the buffet is ending soon, meaning they need to clear the tables or telling us to 'bugger off' as they need to prepare the tables for Dinner. Not only that, halfway through our food, they came to give us for the bill!

The service staff including the food counter service are disappointing. Not friendly nor smiles like any other establishments in the hotel. And the food counters are not even busy!

My husband is Club at Hyatt member for a very long time. Thus we frequent Mezza9 , Pool Bar & Pete's Place all the time. Food is always great and service are fantastic at these 3 restaurants but I can't say so for Straits Kitchen. So does that means, Straits Kitchen customers who came to eat for buffet (it seemed to me) are treated differently from other establishments for the same hotel? Or the service staff assigned are less experience or do not require to have any interaction with diners since there were no table service? Or the manager, at the very least to ensure that drinks / beverages (only that) ordered by customers, to be sent as soon as they can.

Verdict:
1. The staff rushed us to our table;
2. Customer rushed for our food, *and drinks, (1.5hrs period)
3. Counter staff (nothing to rush) most food are already prepared
4. Service staff rushed to clear the plates
5. Service staff rushed the customers to settle the bill
6. Service staff rushed us to clear the tables for next session

So if 1.5hrs afternoon tea is too short and rushing for everyone, why have the session? Just have lunch buffet & early Dinner buffets (so no rush) hence better service (hopefully) when the staff have enough rest.

Hope the positive feedbacks helps."
Rip-off?,"As I understand that during these troubled times nothing can compared with previous days, I still believe that value for money should be respected. Now, we paid S$ 72.- per Head for a buffet which is probably worth half. The selection is limited and q uality wise it’s simply average.
Some of the dishes had a rather strange taste or flavour.
Don’t want to spend too many words for the dishes, but considering that this Restaurant is in a 5 Star Hotel (Grand Hyatt) it is simply not worth to try. Sorry."
Inconsistent Service,"Staffs who cleared plates are really fast and efficient. Luna and Hafiz is amazing. The malay manager wearing the blazer was nice too. However, the other servers who served our food is undeniably not as fast.

Last order was 9pm, but from 8.30pm, all of them including the chefs are busy clearing and cleaning their stations that our orders are left ignored. I had to verbally inform of my drinks order then they went back to their station to get it done. Which took a longer time yet again. It was confusing cause the tea is from a dispenser and the restaurant was not even crowded. You can see it from the photo.

Diners are always standing near the food counter waiting to be served but chefs are nowhere to be found.

Also, we had to use the prayer room at 8.15pm but doors were locked. I asked help from the female staff that was sitting at the safe entry table and she was really unpleasant and rude. Not even a smile when she talks. It’s like she’s there physically but not mentally at all.

I hope the service could be improved cause Grand Hyatt isn’t a 1-star hotel brand."
Disappointed With the Food,"I have given three stars SOLELY for Mr Sahri or Shari (I hope I got his name right) and his hospitality. Thank you for taking great care of us throughout our time there.

My experience at StraitsKitchen made me compare between other 5-star hotels, given its poor food quality. The Indian fare and teh tarik combo was not too bad actually.

The food paired with the cold attitude of the staff behind the counter was a downright disappointment for a 5-star establishment. Not to mention the hostess at the host stand who goes by the name of Ghitha. I was turned off by her rudeness and curt replies. She made us feel less than welcome.

I had higher hopes for desserts but only to be greatly disappointed. The pulut hitam, ondeh-ondeh, banana fritters... they have it better at local food stalls. The soft serve was interesting. But may I make a humble suggestion? Serve it in a smaller cup to avoid wastage. I had observed a lot of diners left more than half of it.

The pandemic shouldn't be a reason for the lapse in food and service quality. It has nothing to do with it.
What is the point in being 'spoilt for choices' when almost none of it was good enough? Was hoping for more at Straits Ktchen. But it was meh. Will I come back? Perhaps not."
1 hr for High Tea time is aint enough.,"1 hr for High Tea wasnt enough. We rushing to eat. I dont enjoy despite the food are delicious.
We have problem bcos Chope email did not indicate the Voucher No. I gave them the Confirmed ID but the Straits Kitchen staff didnt want to accept. Finally we paid the full price. Very disappointed indeed."
Many of the food here are,"Many of the food here are either too salty or too sweet. Those with high blood pressure or diabetic should avoid coming to dine in this restaurant. Mee goreng, char kway teow and prata are so salty.... Bircher muesli is so sweet ....."
Excellent food and service,"We came here to celebrate a family member's birthday and felt really well taken care of throughout the meal. They even prepared a small birthday cake for us! Food was of high quality and served promptly. It's an alacarte buffet, but there's still quite a variety to try. A special shoutout to Mr Othman who was very personable and tried to make the dinner experience a good one for my parents especially."
My favourite halal Singaporean meal,"My all time favourite when we feel like having all Singaporean feast in one location, conducive ambience, and good service. Pepper crab, otah, satay, double boil soup, Laksa, garlic nan & northern Indian dishes."
Honeymoon Dinner,"We were spoilt for choices for our dinner on 13 January 2021 and came across Straits Kitchen at the Grand Hyatt. The moment we stepped in to the restaurant, the female host greeted us with a warm smile and bubbly personality. We were seated down to our table by the waiters. There were many cuisines for the buffet and we decided to try it all out individually. We highly recommend trying the tiger prawns and satay from the Malay Cuisine, butter chicken and garlic Naan, popiah and Hainanese chicken rice. We would like to commend the exceptional service and warm hospitality from Vasu, Thiruna and Anarul. Anarul even surprised us with a delicious chocolate cake for our honeymoon at the end of our dinner. He was very polite, courteous and always smiling. Thank you for making our honeymoon a memorable experience for us both."
Christmas Dinner,"We booked Straits Kitchen after reading the reviews and it's was a disappointment to us. We were there to celebrate Christmas and my son's birthday 25/12/2020. Up front we paid $400+ for 4 person. We understand as the current situation it's not possible to have a speard of buffet, but the food that was served to our table was not worth the amount we paid. On top of that some of the dishes was not to the standard. A few siting around our table was disappointed with serving of food and waiting time as well. We had to keep requesting for clean plates and to clear the table. We had a long waiting time in between our orders. So we were not able to enjoy ourselves. I'm very sorry to say we could have a better meal in a normal sea food restaurant or any other local restaurants. Our Christmas Dinner and the birthday celebrations was ruined. ** Thumb up to the young servers as they keep coming to the table to check if we're waiting for our food after our second course of meal."
High Tea at Grand Hyatt,"Very happy with the food and the service. This is the widest range of high tea I have ever experienced. We were serviced by Anarul and he is a very pleasant personality. Anarul helped us by accepting late orders as we reached very close to the closing time and looked after us although it was quite a busy day.

We would definitely like to come back again."
Great food!,"Fast service, efficient and attentive staff and delicious food. Our server, Anarul was very helpful and attentive to our needs."
"Food quality is not bad..However, staff charged additional amount to my account which is unacceptable","Service for crew can be improved. Not all customers can accept “sorry, your card was charged additional $243,34 due to xx distraction and your card was mixed up with the other table.”.

What if there are more tables who asked for bill at the same time during peak period?"
Average experience on quality and service,"The food variety was not much and the taste was average. Out of the dishes I ordered, it was only the black pepper crab and satay were nice."
Excellent flavours and service,Kudos to Mr Sahri whose service/ hospitality made us feel as if we came to his home for fine dining. Flavours of Indian foods were particularly excellent! Variety limited.
Family friendly buffet restaurant,"I have been there plenty of times on business dinner. But only the last 2 time where i had first brought my family to it then i truly appreciate the ambiance, the food and the service rendered.. Due to covid, it was a sit down buffet style. They have food served to us promptly and with a smile and warmth every single time. No matter how busy, i was never made to feel like i was 'burdening' them with my frequent request of food. The space is good to move about with a stroller and the menu is just nice. Would definitely go there again and recommend for choice of buffet restaurant."
First time and definitely not the last,"First ever time here. And i had a great dinner.
With the new norm, u actually have your buffet on table wait. Service are good and the food are yummy. Its even better this way cos u actually hav your food really fresh n warm.
But sitting too long cud actually get u quite stuffed compared to a lil walk to look at the buffet spread and sorts. Im not complaining cos the service supercedes my expectations.

I listened to my frens abt trying their laksa and yes it was really gd. The rendang made me stuff my alrdy full self after jus a test bite from my partner and it was jus so ive to hav it myself

Dont expect much of a selection here but every food are really good.
The banana fritters was amazing cos it came freshly cook. Try it with their soft serve coconut icecream. So sedappppp!!

Sadly id like to give a shoutout to the staff that attend to most of our food orders but i forgot his name. Nice chap and very attentive to each and everyone of us. He’s an Indian, tall and handsomely bald. Nice guy!
He’s awesome and we’re very happy to hav him serving us.
Thank u for the surprise bday cake
It was a pleasure to meet u!

Thank u SK for the great spread. Ill come back again for sure. Ure in my list of fav buffet now. Good food comes w a price and im happy to come back again.

Sorry i hav no pic of food for my time with my family was all that i wanted but u still deserve this review. Thank u n stay amazing!"
My go to place for any Celebration!!,"What can i say. Even with the COVID measure, Straits Kitchen has never failed to impress. Not needing to queue for food allows diners to spend more time catching up. Ordering in easy and the food is served in measured portions which minimises wastage. We celebrated a birthday and having informed included that in when making a reservation online, we were served with cake. A nice touch. Keeps me coming back for more."
Birthday celebration,"It was a friend's birthday and we decided to have it at straits kitchen to sample all the local dishes at one go! We started with the appetisers - popiah, royal, followed by fried kway teow, fried carrot cake, hainanese chicken, roast duck, chilly crab. Good selection of dessert, juices too."
Top quality local fare in buffet setting,"Let's get one thing straight. There are many buffets in Singapore that offer local hawker fare. But if you are looking for one with top notch quality, service and ambience, then there's none other than Straits Kitchen. There really is a big difference in quality. The typical menu consists of food from different Asian cultures: Chinese, Malay, Indian, Peranakan, and local hawker food."
Thank you Amy!,The food there is delicious! and the staff there are really friendly especially Amy! She keep helping me to take crab and asking me how’s the food!
Friends gathering:),"It’s a good place for us to hv a dinner here. We enjoy the food, drinks, service etc...all good. Will be beck for our next gathering 😁😁😁"
Encourage the staffs,"Amy, Aimee and Belle was serving with high quality. And the food is all the best and local.Must try it and enjoy it with friends or family."
food variety was ok but service was slow. staff not attentive. Air con not strong. food layout was not user friendly,Food names were not easily visible. I had no idea they served coffee or tea. Staff did not introduce proactively.
Maybe because of COVID-19 Straitskitchen did not offer what they usually do,"I understand that the time was not very convenient to dine in a restaurant in Singapore. The place was nearly empty, which is not necessarily bad, but the food was not prepared as it used to be, i.e., in abundance. You could barely get Satay. Many things that used to be popular there were inexistent!"
Great smorgasbord of Singaporean food in upmarket surroundings,"This has been around for decades but still stays true to its original aim of serving a huge smorgasbord of Singaporean style dishes from the three or four major racial groups here ( Chinese, Indian, Malay, Eurasian and Peranakan, etc.). Always very crowded despite its relatively high per person all-you-can-eat price, but seems like it is mainly foreign tourists who come to dine here, and likely upmarket ones at that ....which is what this restaurant is really all about : an upmarket display of famous Singapore staples served buffet style from multiple counters/areas of this very stylish restaurant. Expect dishes like chicken rice, satay, briyani, popiah, etc etc. some cooked or prepared freshly a la minute on the spot. All the dishes here are done to a very high standard admittedly. But while dining here is a fantastic (and even exotic) food experience for most first time visitors to Singapore (and they get to conveniently try all our famous but diverse foods in one place at the same time), it can be a bit of a boring and expensive food destination for most Singaporeans who are very used to eating this kind of food on an everyday basis and at much cheaper prices. Most locals probably won’t find anything too interesting in the offerings here, excellent though they may be. But it is enormously successful nonetheless as a commercial restaurant as it feeds the huge tourist hordes that come here every day of the week. And it is a Halal certified restaurant to boot, so Muslim guests would have no problems eating here at all. I came with a group of foreign conference guests from the US, UK , Europe, India and other parts of Asia, many of whom were in Singapore for the first time, and it was smiles all around and a universal thumbs up from all of them. So it remains a very successful showcase of classic Singapore cuisine, which is a melange of all our major ethnic groups living here. Looks like it will live on here in this guise for many many more years to come....."
Excellent Service,"Excellent service by Malou, Janet & Ivy. We had our company CNY celebration and we were well attended by the staff. Food was a good selection of perenakan cuisine."
A very pleasant evening with,"A very pleasant evening with my alum so well served by katsuri, belle and malou. Big shout out to the team!"
Baby friendly buffet place!,Went to celebrate my hubby's birthday with our 7 month baby during week day buffet lunch. Service staff are very friendly and service-oriented. Great variety of high quality cooked food and desserts!
Great Asian Buffet.. Probably the best!,"Company lunch on eve of xmas. I am impressed. Dishes cook to perfection. They use fresh ingredients. Fresh prawns. Big fat made to order chinese popiah. The best laksa I’ve ever had, tasty gravy with fresh dried prawns. Fried carrot cake not too oily. Perfectly grilled satay. Chendol with fresh Durian paste. And not to mention, the chicken rice is superb. Steamed chicken is OMG juicy. And many more. What i like is that the buffet has got a selection of juices, cold and hot beverages. Freshly squeezed oranges is a plus. This is a very filling buffet compared to what we previously had at Carousel @ Royal Plaza on Scotts. Probably because its Asian dishes so we hit on more Carbo. Come with an empty stomach! Highly recommended!

We were seated at the end of the restaurant near the staff room. Management please look into the air conditioning at that area. Its hot down there. We are sweating profusely.

Will be back!!!"
Workshop at Grand Hyatt,"The function room was prepared seamlessly for our workshop. All the team members involved , Justina, Yuan Lee, mike we’re exceptional! Eye for detail and anticipated all our needs. Such a wonderful team and a great ambassador to the hotel!

Such a great lunch and everyone agreed how great the food was.
Special mention to Othman from Straits Kitchen, he really went all the way to engage everyone at the table! Polite, smiling all the way..
Special mention to Anarul too who is very attentive to all the guests. Quick at responding.

Definitely my first choice restaurant either for lunch or dinner!

Will be back for sure."
Amazing customer service,"Thank you to Kasthuri, Kevin and the part-timer, who were assigned to our area, for your professionalism and always accommodating to our needs. They are so friendly and polite. Our family had a great evening at the restaurant. Thumbs up!
And the teh tarik is really good."
Great service!,Went there to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday. It was her first time there & she definitely had a great experience! The food was delicious & service was fantastic! Definitely will be back...
Company Lunch,"Excellent food all around. Kudos to the chefs and especially those who were standing before a hot grill and constantly turning out well cooked food despite the heat. We were given a cosy area where everyone from our company was seated together. Seating arrangement allowed everyone to be able to move about without having to disturb others at the table.
Most importantly excellent service. In particular:-
(1) Kasthuri who was warm, friendly, attentive and had initiative.
(2) Yan Pheng who handled all our requests very professionally;
(3) Jhoana who was very professional in handling the group reservation and making all the arrangements for our lunch;
(4) Mr Vina who was very professional in addressing customer concerns and feedback.
Thank you everyone. We enjoyed ourselves and the food very much."
Was expecting better.,"Service was not up to standard. Went to find own table when arrived at the restaurant. Food was not readily available (not frequently topped up). The person that was supposed to attend to my bills took so long in getting back (handling 2 different customers at the same time).
All in all, will bot consider returning back to this restaurant."
Buffet lunch,"I was looking forward to having buffet lunch in the restaurant, it’s always booked even as a guest of the hotel you have to book in advance. Food was average and made for locals. There was no salad bar anywhere. When I asked them about it they told me that they don’t serve salad at lunch time. I was a bit shocked. So $70 later I left hungry and disappointed."
Yummy Buffet and great service,"Decided to go to Straits Kitchen after a change of plans and was not disappointed.

The food was great and there was an amazing variety- We had a great time sampling all the different stations! The service was amazing right from the start and they were so friendly! Went to another 5 star hotel in Marina Square and their service was absolutely atrocious- kudos to the team at Straits Kitchen! Fantastic job!"
Letter of Compliment,"I would love to thank Mr Thiruna from Straits’ Kitchen for his great hospitality and outstanding service! I’m a frequent diner in this establishment and Mr Thiruna has never failed to give me his salutation as well as recognition. I’m truly ‘wow-ed’ by his warmth, sincerity and passion in service! I am writing this letter on my own accord as I’ve been here many times and never once has he asked for a complimentary letter unlike many of the service staff at other restaurants out there. He is indeed a great addition to the restaurant! Congratulations!"
"UNWELCOMING CHEF AT grill station nov,19th.","The restaurants chef at the grill station was grilling the “room service” steak when asked in doubt, they brushed us off rudely saying the “steak” is not part of the menu for us to go away. My family and I have been visiting Straits Kitchen for the past 10 years and always have fond memories and good impressions with the place because of the ambience, quality of food etc. This one single act destroyed the night and it was my wife birthday. Sad but true. Please do something about this."
My visit,It was one of the most best ambience which I had visited. The staff were so helpful that they had assisted me in getting vegetarian options also. The food prepared is fresh and tasty.
Unbeatable Singaporean Buffet,"As a buffet lover, StraitsKitchen is always in my top three list worldwide. But one thing to bear in mind that this is a local Singaporean cuisine with Singapore, malay, chinese and indian dishes. So if you expect international options, this might not be the right place.

However, in terms of food option and quality, this restaurant has been very consistent over the last 6 years (I visit Singapore once or twice per year and I always come back for dinner everytime).

The recommended dishes include Singaporean stir fried crab, satay counter, Hainan Chicken rice which is very juicy and tender. Not to miss local dessert counters.

We enjoyed our dinner this time as usual. Waitresses clears up our plates promptly.

In conclusion, this is a great buffet restaurant with consistently top notch food quality and service."
Great tasting local food,"A good chance to try the local selections of delicacies if you're in town. The. Honestly prefer the Hawker stalls but the cooks at this restaurant a masters. At the same time some of them are quite arrogant, therefore not full marks."
"Top design, top local food",The design of the place is really the best and it has the best selection of local food. They fish curry was the best.
Decent Halal restaurant with nice ambience,"We ate here for dinner and breakfast as we are staying at the hotel.
The food is in general delicious but the variety of the food can be improved. They serve the same menu almost everyday especially for the breakfast buffet. We got bored with the food on our 3rd day having breakfast there.
The dinner buffet is nice especially the Chili crab and the Durian cendol (Dessert).
Other than that, I have to compliment the staff who are very friendly and provided great and fast services to make us and our kids very comfortable every time we come there to eat."
Expensive but good,Make sure you are hungry as it’s expensive so you need to eat a lot! Good food Indian/ Malay/Chinese
Awesome spread of local dishes,"An ideal place to take first-time visitors to Singapore, as it gives them a great overview of the main local dishes: chicken rice, prawn mee, laksa, beef rendang, carrot cake, black pepper crab, popish, durian chendol, ice kachang, etc. But no suckling pig, as StraitsKitchen is halal, and very popular with the Muslim community. Prices are reasonable for the quality and the extent of the spread."
Great Food & Affordable,"I like the ambience and the layout of each section which easy to access. The food are so tasty especially the Northern Indian curry, prata, Laksa is so rich, chilli crabs, and the Nyonya desserts. I cant eat much though! This restaurant located at Grand Hyatt Hotel. Service also excellent, I was there on 14th October, the crowd reasonably fair, thus you get much of attention. The restaurant manager ,a Malay sorry I could not get his name; very attentive."
Excellent buffet spread but...,"Been a number of years since I visited StraitsKitchen so I was really looking forward to coming back again.

It was unexpectedly busy during a Friday lunch time because there was some Teachers' Day celebration thing going on so the restaurant was super packed. Very crowded and very noisy like a market place. Definitely not the best ambience to enjoy a quiet, peaceful meal. Queues at most of the stations were long and food wasn't replenished fast enough. There were a few times when I headed towards specific stations, I had to return to my table empty-handed just to wait for the refills. Because of that, lunch was particularly long that day.

Therefore I suggest that if you're planning to have a meal there, you may want to check with them if they are expecting a huge influx of diners especially before/during special occasions/festivals.

Food wise, I must say the buffet spread was really sumptuous. There were chilled seafood and plenty of Asian/local delights such as chicken rice, roast duck, soy sauce chicken, nasi padang (lots of ingredient choices), Indian cuisine (assorted curry/spiced dishes, prata, naan, murtabak, etc), laksa, popiah, otah, BBQ chicken wings, freshly fried fritters, shaved ice station, kueh kueh and other desserts.

I highly recommend the Indian food station that serves a lovely array of piquant and flavoursome dishes. Everything was packed full of spices and was nicely balanced too so nothing was overly salty. Surprisingly, the naan, prata and murtabak were all good - probably the best I had in any hotel buffet. Gotta mop up those delicious gravies with these carbs.

Nasi padang was fantastic too. Every single dish that I tried was good. The fried chicken was particularly tasty. From the chilled seafood station, I enjoyed the huge-sized prawns that had lots of roe and brain juices as well as the fresh sweet clams. The mussels weren't worth eating because the flesh were all shrivelled and miserable-looking (not appetising at all).

Laksa was pretty good. Fragrant coconut milk and ample spices. Sambal was spicy enough to give that extra oomph too.

Fried sweet potato and banana fritters were very crispy. Taro was too dry though. I liked that the batter wasn't overly thick and heavy. Better than many goreng pisang stalls.

Soft serve ice cream (mango/coconut) was too saccharine and cloying. The assorted kueh was probably left out for too long and was really dry.

Overall, savouries scored for sure. Desserts - not worth the calories."
"Great food, great ambiance but can be doomed soon","A lot of good food choices with a very nice ambiance created by super potato. I love the satay, roasted duck and prata. Their laksa is really light and does not give you the ‘jelat - bloated kinda’ feeling which is rare to find in Singapore. It is too bad that all great things were ruined by the staffs that kept talking while preparing the dishes or even in front of the food. I hope the management can do something fast before it is too late."
Birthday dinner celebration at Straits Kitchen on 9 October 2019,"We had a blast and the service was impeccable! It was laughter all the way, especially for the birthday ‘boy’😊👌"
Great ambience good food,"It was a lovely evening and a great spread (except was a little disappointed not to see Char Kuay Teow). Ambience was good. Service was good except it was a tad hard to catch the waiter when you need one. But when he / she came, it was prompt and courteous service."
Huge breakfast,"Breakfast here is almost an excursion. The buffet choice of 4 Asian cuisines, plus al a carte, made for a difficult choice. I was not here long enough to try all, unfortunately."
Better if food was hot,"Food was tasty but as it was not hot, it was a lacklustre makan experience for us. Don’t think we will be back soon. Ambience was good."
Dinner,"Straits Kitchen provides an exquisite buffet . Their chefs have turned out a delightful spread blending Indonesian..Malaysian...Thai and Singaporean cuisine, plus many Indian delicacies. Straits Kitchen is a must visit for anyone wanting to savour the true flavours of Asian Cuisine. Their service is unmatched and their manager Sudarshan(Shan) is exceptional."
Larger groups & variety of local cusiens,"The variety, freshness, overall quality, availability of local cuisines, the atmospheric setup and ambiance are really fine. Unique and great for bigger gatherings and special occasions. The price is high and therefore makes this a place that is more suitable for business outings or one time visits for the general public.

I think it is true that you can easily find the individual types of food served here at all corners of Singapore. But the fact that you can simply walk around and pick and choose what you’d like to eat and enjoy the most, helps increase the joy of coming to this place.

The general service is very average at best and possibly slow as often dirty dishes pile up or you have to wait and look for someone to help you with refreshment refills."
Dinner,"Brought first timers to Singapore, showing and let them experience the different cuisine we have. They enjoyed all the food! It was a clash of flavours! They had Chinese, Indian, Malay, Nyonya all at once! So much to choose was their comment. The satay, Indian, Nyonya cakes including rojak and chendol are great choices. The guest enjoyed Popiah, Chinese burrito! The restaurant has been around for sometime. Food was great, albeit service was minimal. Perhaps a little short handed? Price is on the high end, but it’s great to entertain friends for the Singapore experience all in one location!"
Must try!!!,"Had a delightful lunch at Straits Kitchen. Food quality was excellent. Fantastic spread. The most important part was the service! Our server was Jojo & she was very attentive, nice and friendly. She made sure our drinks were always topped up and gave us some recommendations. Overall had an amazing time and great way to spend last day in the city. Highly recommended!"
Dinner with visitor guests,"Went to Straits Kitchen for team buffet dinner with company guests. Straits Kitchen offers a wide variety of Asian cuisine from Malay, Indian, Chinese, Peranakan with many old roadside cakes, desserts and sweets. Good ambience and food."
"AAA for Ambiance, Food and Services","If you are in Singapore, of course you must try the hawker centers and food courts. Miss them and you regret it. You would be impressed by the the spread of food. If you however want to have these in a better environment, services and ...., I would recommend a local food buffet in a good hotel. There are many, but among the top on my list is this place. Many of such buffets come and go, but this place has been around for a couple of decades - with a reason. It is ideal for families and friends, business dinners fine too if you want a less stiff environment to strike a deal."
Never fails to satisfy,"One of our regular must visits when in Singapore over the years and still satisfy all our cravings.
This visit, the highlights were the curry crab and Durian Ice Kachang.
Satay always good as well as authentic Nonya food. Fresh orange, mango and guava juice always nice, though it would be nice to have sugar cane juice included in the meal price. Always love the desserts but have to consciously leave room for them and not over eat on savoury food.
Only downside was a Peddler snuck in (reasonable well dressed and looked like a customer) and sat down at our table when I was gone and asked my wife for money before she told him to leave and chased out by staff. Manager and staff profusely apologised afterwards. (but no freebies or discounts)"
"Great food, greater service!","The wife had booked a table for two for my birthday treat, and I was happy to say the least upon discovering we were having dinner at Straits Kitchen.

I always start off with the soups, and they never let me down whether it’s Buddha Jumps Over the Wall or Wintermelon Soup. Only advice is to go easy as this is a buffet and the soup portions are huge so don’t fill yourself up too quickly!

Then there’s the chicken rice, specifically the steamed chicken which having been cooked to perfection is so tender and flavourful even without the chilli and rice accompaniment. For this visit I felt they had toned down the spiciness of the chilli perhaps to pander to those who have lower tolerance, but no love lost in any case!

Then there’s my (now no longer) secret dish which you have to order at the noodle section. It’s basically asking for wanton soup, but asking the chef to use the prawn noodle broth as the soup instead. This you won’t be able to get anywhere else in Singapore so please try and be surprised at how yummy this is!

Last but not least, excellent service was rendered by Nithya (sorry if i got the spelling wrong) as my wife had made a cheeky request to customise a mini putri salat birthday cake and he and the other staff made that happen complete with strawberries, blueberries, a candle and a birthday song!

So once again, thank you Straits Kitchen for making this a really memorable visit for me and the missus, and I look forward to many more to come!"
Impeccable Service + Food,"I am never one to write a review, what more on TripAdvisor. Created an account just so I could shout out to this amazing place. I came by last Friday to celebrate my birthday with my husband. Chose StraitsKitchen as I am currently 9 months pregnant and other buffets serve live seafood which I can't take. We were the first few to arrive hence we got to try almost everything without queuing or waiting for them to replenish the food. Not only did the food blow us away, but Kumar and Kok Siong who were serving us were also particularly attentive to us. They saw me struggling while eating my Naan, Kumar immediately offered a bowl of water to rinse my hands. Kok Siong on the other hand, was quick in clearing my plates away. Which made a lot of space for more food! Even though it was getting busier, they never neglected us! Then, there was Chef Nelson at the Rojak Station who initatied a conversation with me and ensured my rojak was prepared without the pineapple considering I was pregnant! Very much thoughtful! I am so coming back! All because of Kumar, Kok Siong and Chef Nelson! Kudos to you guys! Please relay my heartiest thanks to them!"
Solid Singapore Fare,"The food is tasty at StraitsKitchen. We found our way here after arriving late at the Hyatt. For the price, however, I would've expected better food or more of it. We ordered the chicken rice and hokkien prawn mee. The presentation of the food is excellent as is the service."
Favorite buffet in Singapore,"This is my favorite hotel buffet in Singapore. The food selection is decidedly simple: Indian, Chinese, Malay, traditional desserts and traditional appetizers. I've been coming here for decades and always stuff myself because everything is delicious.

Tip: join ""Club at the Hyatt"" membership. My wife and I get 50% off every time we come here."
Excellent buffet,"A great buffet display of many good dishes to choose from in many styles. The sea food was very fresh and tasted delicious. The wines were excellent, a bit pricy, but that is to be expected for this quality in Singapore. I highly recommend to combine the diner with a drink at the grand Hyatt bar one floor higher."
Excellent Indian Food. Best that we have tasted,Wish they had a separate buffet deal just for Vegetarians or vegans or just for someone keen to have only Indian buffet. Oh well. Its still good food.
Delicious Food And Ambiance,Satisfied and worth the money. Nice place to have gatherings and enjoy the food.Friendly and experienced staff.
A Return Visit,"The last time I was here was a few years ago, and I am happy to say nothing much has changed. The buffet restaurant was crowded, not only because it was a Saturday, but also because the food was good.

Having counters set up offering various cuisine was all the rage then and it still has not lost its novelty. Patrons will be overwhelmed by the sheer number of dishes they can feast.

The service could be improved though, as the server at our station did not seem very service-oriented. However, this is merely a minor point, for there is always a need for continuous improvement."
Wonderful international buffet in the Grand Hyatt,"A cousin of mine who lives in Singapore treated us to a wonderful lunch buffet where you can dine on Chinese, Malay, and Indian foods in one lovely location. We tried a little of everything, including desserts that looked like sushi! Great, especially if you have limited time in Singapore and want to sample a variety of local foods."
Birthday celebration dinner,"Nice fresh food to satisfy your taste buds. Love the crabs and satay and of course the fresh juices. Location wise is a plus, and the waiters friendly and welcoming services really make you feel warm at heart. Great birthday song sang by the waiters, my sister really impressed by their unique birthday song, which is not the usual tune. We have fyn there. Thank you guys."
Local food feast,"Very satisfying meal experience with friends Variety of delicious local food Chinese, Indian and Singaporean specialties. Seafood for dinner. dessert Kueh as you wish. Very nice"
Not a 5 Star Luxury Hotel Experience,"Service was non-existent, food was mediocre at best, and the ambience was no where near what we expected from a 5-star luxury hotel. After being seated at a table with too many chairs, we waited for about 5 minutes and no one came to our table. Waitstaff just passed by us without even looking. I eventually went back to the hostess stand and asked what was MEANT to happen. It was our first time here and there was NO introduction to the buffet, NO offer of drink service and NO one attending to the table. The same was true when it came time for the bill. Even though dozens of staff were just standing around, we couldn't flag one down to get us the check. Again, I had to go to the hostess stand. Then, the staff member who brought the bill started reading it out loud including the cost of things!!! Shocking. The whole table didn't need to know how much the champagne costs. For a F&B director who prides himself on options for vegetarians, the ones in my group were VERY disappointed. There was actually only one vegetable on the entire buffet and it was swimming in soy sauce. Our multi-cultural group included 1 Singaporean, 1 Indian, 1 Malaysian, and American and a Brit. No one was happy with any part of their meal."
Thank you!,"Excellent food that was surpassed only by excellent service. I would recommend anyone to go there. Make sure you get your reservations early as they are always crowded, and that’s for a reason"
Top quality buffet,"We enjoyed the Asian dinner buffet with friends and our children on 16 April. The food was amazing. Our friends are Singaporean and we are British, it was a perfect way to try a range of Asian dishes.

I originally thought this was quite pricey but when I arrived and saw the restaurant and the choice and quality of food on offer I felt this was reasonable. The staff are very friendly and were always on hand to explain the dishes or to assist our children with serving the food.

The fresh juices and desserts were also amazing. Will definitely return next time we are in Singapore."
A true taste of Singapore buffett,"Had a farewell dinner at the StraitsKitchen in the Grand Hyatt Hotel Sunday evening with my good Singaporean friends as I leave to fly back to the US this morning. They love bringing out-of-town guests here for the variety of food offered including Singaporean, Chinese, Malay, Indonesian and Indian dishes. The selection is amazing and the quality and taste sublime. The service is also very good with attentive waitstaff, not too intrusive, but always watching and knowing when to help. Also love the setting and atmosphere. All in all a great place to come for a true taste of Singapore!"
Great local food,"My family and I visit the straits kitchen at the Singapore Hyatt hotel at least once a week. Great spread of local food : Indian, Malay and Chinese . Buffet style . The only restaurant in the hotel that is Halal.
Servers are great and accommodating .
My Son is special needs and in a wheelchair , the staff never fail to cheerfully greet him.
This restaurant is a great place to introduce overseas visitors to local food
The desert counter offers a variety of Asian deserts and cakes . Teh Tarim is a must try"
Everything you can possible try at Straits Kitchen,"If you wish to try all the different local cuisines in air conditioned comfort, the Straits Kitchen buffet is your destination, an all in one location. Its not cheap, but you can try everything from Chinese, Indian, Singaporean, Malay, Indonesian, Peranakan, and they even have murtabah in the Indian corner, which is rare in any buffet. The desserts are also very colorful and delicious. Worth a visit whether for lunch or dinner. Everything is made fresh and replenished, the items do NOT sit around for a long time and the chefs stay very busy to ensure this!"
