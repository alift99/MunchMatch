Re : Great place for Omasake,"Fresh food, great service . The restaurant sent reminders and also give tips on where to park. The staff is very attentive. it was raining when we left the restaurant. They offered to shelter us to our car. The fish is fresh and yummy."
Great service and Food!,Very good service ! Chefs are friendly and the food is delicious. Location is also convenient since it is near to mrt station
Excellent food at reasonable price!!,Fantastic value for lunch set. Still good food and great taste. Repeated visits. Very easy to make reservations via Chope app. Shinzo's staff will call one day in advance of the appointment date to confirm.
"Unpretentious setting, amazing food","Highly recommend this place if you want a fuss-free omakase experience with the freshest, top notch ingredients crafted exquisitely into small plates of heavenly goodness. The chef and staff were super friendly and knowledgeable, really tended to all our requests and questions and make us feel really at ease as we enjoyed the great food. Thumbs up and will definitely come again!"
Good value omakase lunch.,The place is open concept where you can see the chefs working without any barriers. The chefs are friendly and interacts with the customers freely. The food is fresh and good. Well worth the $118 and $138 that we paid for the omakase lunch. We really enjoyed our lunch.
A fun and nice experience,"The chefs were all so nice and friendly, they made us feel welcome. I went with friends and everybody had a fun and relaxing time. The food was excellent."
"Cozy, friendly and Authentic Japanese Cuisine","Though the place is small, the staff are friendly and the sushi are marvelous. They even gave us a small piece of cake after knowing that it's 1 of the guest birthday."
Excellent food at reasonable price!!,"I am a long time regular, going there for lunch and dinner. Their lunch sets are unbeatable in terms of food quality, taste and pricing. Best in Town!!"
Excellent!,Excellent food & service! Our guests were so pleased. All of us enjoyed the delicious meal. The quality as well as the presentation of food is highly commendable! The restaurant wasn’t big but what we liked was its cleanliness & the warmth. The service staff were observant/attentive. Every dish was passionately prepared. There is ample parking space near Shinzo. Thank you.
Birthday lunch,Our lunch at shinzo was amazing. Compliments to chef Xiang. Would definitely come back again and try out a different menu. Love the whole experience!
Value lunch,"A sushi counter restaurant. They have a choice of lunch set or the lunch Omakase menu. My wife decide she wanted a Tempura lunch set at $38 which consisted of an appetiser ( pitan tofu), sashimi 5 pieces, soup, tempura basket, rice and sherbet while I chose their lunch take Omakase menu. 3 appetisers, 7 sashimi items, fish chicks in soya sauce, 7 good quality nigiri sushi, soup and dessert plate for $118. The meal was satisfying and all the nigiri was made one piece at a time. The chef are locals but has many experience serving sushi. Environment is a typical sushi bar restaurant, small and cosy. Overall, good taste and good value for lunch."
Absolute steal - early bird dinner,"The blue fin tuna sashimi tasted like butter, unlike any tuna sashimi we had. Every piece of nigiri was good and got better with the next; we usually don’t go for tuna and anago but we were wowed by the flavour and texture of the aburi otoro and anago. The starter had an interesting note that reminds me of century eggs. The hot food of mushroom tofu and foie gras chawanmushi were luscious."
Disappointed,"Not value for money. We didn't even eat anything substantial! It was just the usual sushi, sashimi, chawanmushi, tofu. I had a shock when they presented the sorbet and told us it was the last course! I remember my experience was much better in 2019. I walked out with a full and satisfied stomach."
Great atmosphere and food,Two of us had dinner here to celebrate birthday. This is an Omakase Japanese restaurant during dinner. We opted for the Shinzo Omakase Tokusen. set that cost $208++ per pax. We truly enjoyed our time here as the staffs are friendly and attentive. The food is also good while our chef Kevin Hoo and head chef Patrick Tan were also very chatty and explained in details about the food that were served. Would recommend people to try their Omakase set here and would definitely be back again
Stay away,I have been to almost every omakase restaurants in SG and the quality of this feels like a bento set. It was a waste of time.
Great Food and Experience,"2nd visit to Shinzo and we opted for their Sushi Omakase menu this time round. Fish was very fresh and was delicately prepared by Chef Kevin, who was skilful and professional! The service crew was also very attentive and helpful. Overall it was an excellent dining experience, and would definitely go back to try out other seasonal dishes!"
Good Value Omakase,"Ingredients were extremely fresh, taste is equisite. Chef specially arranged one more cooked dish to replace the item in the menu. Excellent Service. Value for money! Will come again."
Great Japanese omasake. Friendly,"Great Japanese omasake. Friendly staffs, supreme food, fresh sashimi and sushi. Reservation is required as it is very popular."
Excellent food and company,Food at Shinzo is very fresh and good quality. Chef Patrick and Kevin were also very friendly. Enjoyed my dinner.
Friendly Staff and Excellent Food,"Staff are friendly and the Chef was detailed in preparing the food, also give introduction on some ingredient which we are not so familiar with. Cozy Atmosphere. Good"
Wonderful experience,"Shinzo Chef Patrick and team went the extra mile in making sure my best friend birthday experience in their restaurant was fun, enjoyable and memorable. Food is fresh.. should try.."
"Good food, good ambience","It was a good experience with good quality food, friendly staff and good ambience. Will look forward to next visit again."
Reasonably priced omakase with amazing food,"This relative new kid on the block boasts not one but two chefs from what was Singapore's oldest sushi restaurant.

As one can reasonably expect, the standard of sushi is very decent, and the omakase do not come with astronomical price tags.

I would very much prefer it if there was a wider range of sake available at this cosy 10 seater restaurant though, which would certainly elevate the dining experience by a notch."
Exquisite Japanese food in great atmosphere,A great treat to dine at Shinzo. Excellent food and great atmosphere in cosy informal set up. Fantastic to see the chefs at work creating wonderful dishes from the freshest ingredients.
"food was bad, so rush, service was horrible","went for the early bird omakase, was shuffed to one small corner when arrived, shop was totally empty, was told was full so can only eat in corner... range of food was so poor...total i paid $160 for 2 pax, could have gotten much better elsewhere.... service was horrible, the moment i finished one dish, the waitress immediately clear my plate away...end up i finished the meal in 1 hr time...total only had about 5-6 dishes... definitely will not go back again"
"Great Service, Amazing Food (:","We went for an early bird special that the restaurant had and was pleasantly surprised by just how good it was! The place is unassuming, has excellent service, and the chefs were all very friendly too. The food, of course, was amazing ((:"
"Fantastic food, friendly chefs, great ambience, will definitely go back with friends for a good time","Fantastic food, great ambience, great friendly staff, love the new menu, superb!!! Definitely recommended."
Luncheon,Small but cosy. Chef Lawrence and team are simply outstanding. Food is always consistently well presented and tasteful. One of the best exclusive Japanese restaurant for me.
Food is okay for the expensive price.,"The omakase lunch set is about $68 per pax (Total $170 for 2 persons), the food is of good quality, but could be better to make the money worth."
Good value (chef’s lunch recommendation) but dishes aren’t very exciting to be honest.,"Strong fishy odour when I stepped into the restaurant, which is unheard of in any good Japanese restaurant. A bit of a turn off."
Poor service for an omakase,Chefs gave preferential treatment to some diners - we were conveniently ignored and given smaller portions
Hide away place with good food,Very nice quite place with quality food. Service was excellent. As there are a few chef catering to only a few sitting. Food are served promptly.
An early dinner with a date,"Generally , I’m happy with the food quality and services. Good timing on every dish and good pacing and waiting for us to finish each dish."
Won't be back,"I was swayed by the positive reviews and wanted to try the promo omakase and I must say it was the worst decision ever. The greeting when we first entered was lacklustre. Next we were banished to the far end of the restaurant away from the main chef's station which I term as Cold Palace. Yes, I know we were taking advantage of the promotion but surely you should treat your guests better than that? Music was non-Japanese and they were playing 80's music - really weird combination. Food was so-so and if this is the precursor for their main omakase highlights, let's just say we were not impressed, unwelcomed and that $80 could have been better spent in some random sushi chain restaurant. I think we'll stick to authentic Japanese-run omakase restaurants for now."
Average for the promo omasake,"Had the promo omasake, the hot food served was rather normal where one can make it at home. The sushi was not too bad. Will not recommend the promo omakase."
Superb,Simply the best place to bring your loved one and family to enjoy the best Japanese food in Singapore.
fastfood,"couldn't work out if the service was incredibly efficient or they just wanted me to leave as soon as possible - either way it was a super fast experience, food was good but I wont be going back"
Lunch,The food was super delicious and the service is good. All my friends enjoy the food and service. I will consider to go there again.
"Good service, delicious food, but we got sick!","So, first thing is: we made reservations pretty late and our seating was on a secondary bar area, away from the chefs and other diners. That was disappointing because we missed out on interacting with the chefs and watching them prepare the dishes, which is a big part of the experience we were hoping for. It would have been nice to be forewarned about that. Still, the service we received was decent. I would have preferred to have the servers tell us a little more about the dishes they were serving. But the timing was all perfect.The food was very good. The sashimi was the highlight, but the grilled yellowtail cheek and the oyster were also excellent. However, my wife and I both ended the day with some pretty gross stomach problems --- I don't want to get graphic, but it's exactly what you're thinking. After 4 weeks in Malaysian Borneo and Indonesia the only place that gave us any trouble at all was a 180 SGD per person meal in Singapore. And it was pretty bad. Always a risk with raw food, but didn't expect it from such a nice place."
GREAT TIME AT SHINZO,Fantastic time with Lawrence and his gang.after a 2-Year absence. Great food and warm atmosphere. Even my daughter was singing with Lawrence towards the end of our lunch. Will be back for dinner next month when I have saved enough..
Very authentic Japanese cuisine,It was like being in Japan. The restaurant offers a great selection of the most fresh sashimi grade fish and other authentic specialties. Early bird bookings can get a fix menu for a special price.
Ordinary and overpriced,"Below expectations for an omakase, food is ordinary and nothing special compared to other omakase restaurants."
Best place for a cosy omakase meal,"Other than serving creative top-notch omakase meals at reasonable prices, the lively atmosphere with friendly chefs (all non-Japanese!) and crew mingling with diners seated by the counter, allows this cosy little hidden restaurant to have a following.

Their regulars end up becoming good friends with chef and his team, introducing their families, friends and business associates to this fave haunt."
Complete entertainment,"Been to Shinzo several times but this time was a truly complete entertainment experience.
Chef Lawrence not only dazzled with his creative delights in his dishes but he even sang a few songs, albeit some oldies (Chines and English) songs to go with the sake pairing.
His food is exquisite and delightful , of the highest quality and freshness."
Lunch Bliss. All Quality,"Sushi in Singapore as it should be. Salad and three courses. Fresh sashimi.,,small tempura selection and 5 expertly prepares sushi treats. The Uni was as hood as it gets. Steaming mugs of green tea and green tea ice cream to top it off.
TY chef Lawrence and team."
Local’s place,"unique and small nice sushi place Very friendly service, highly recommended I will definitely revisit here"
Really nice sushis and so fresh,"I went there for lunch. What a fantastic discover. We have been warmly welcomed by Chef Lawrence. The restaurant is really cosy and you can feel being in Japan.
Sushis were so fresh and so yummy. Sake selection was really good.
A really nice place to go for sushis."
Value for money and no frills,We went for the early bird omakase which has a time limit on your meal. Sashimi slices were generous and the tempura is good. Very decent quality for the price point.
Always a treat!,"Being a regular at this sushi bar, assures us great service and the best food options. The chefs take care of all diners serving the most delicious cooked food and the freshest sushi. If something is not up to par, they will suggest a different fish for your sushi. To top it, their dishes are innovative and clever. The price is worth the experience."
Nice Food,I like the food there. And the service by the waiter and waitress are excellent. I will drop by again if given the chance to Singapore for business trip.
Cosy Japanese lunch,I ordered a wagyu beef set lunch which was about average. There is nothing outstanding and the quantity seems to have diminshed. I thought the food I had was much better when I visited this restaurant one month ago.
Omakase Lunch,"Fantastic food, great service, freshest of produce. Perfect! Decent portion meals and good attention to dietary constrains. Reservation is highly recomended!"
Great food in understated environment,Good food but was busy so chefs taking care of another party so we were at the entrance and saw little chef activity and zero food prep. Service a bit slow but good altogether and will go again. Pricey but somehow exclusive and food fresh and good
Not coming back again,"came here for my friend's birthday dinner.
We ordered the $68 omakase early dinner set.
Food served was very average, and doesnt seem value for money. No uni no hotate no ootoro.
Just cheap ingredients.
The chef did not bother to explain the dish, just kept talking among themselves."
Nice Omakase experience,"Food was good, not exceptional. Place was a little noisy and chef was drinking alcohol on the job. Not sure how to feel about that. Chefs and servers are chinese speaking, did not feel like an authentic japanese food experience. Would recommend if you're in the area and feel like splurging on some slightly above average japanese food."
Sushi that hits the Right spot,"Having tried a few different places I must say Shinzo hit the Right note with me.
Exec Chef Lawrence Chia was on hand to take care of us and he's recommendations were great and according to our preferences. U know how some places just serve u the most costly and worse part it's something u don't really fancy. Hahaha
Highly recommended for those who wants a cosy and yet not to loud environment. Just a pleasant evening with friends type."
One of best Japanese Food in town,Have come back to this place many times. It's a small place hard to get seat. By accident sawbcan use Chope to book. Very convenient. Set lunch are value for money. Come around 1.30pm if can't get reservations as they close 2.30 for lunch.
Excellent Jap cuisine,The food was good and the service was great. We had a pleasant dining experience. Keep up the good work and worth visiting another time soon.
Thanks for everything!,Thank you chef Lawence Chia and all staffs to make my wife’s birthday a memorable one! For sure we will come back again and again!
Japanese in Chinatown,"This is a favourite for excellent sashimi, sushi and cooked food. Good sake menu too. But best of all, is the excellent service from the chefs and waitstaff."
Overall good experience,"This was not my first and definitely not my last, given the great foodie and nice ambience. Although I was abit turned off in my last visit 3 days ago.

It was my wife bday, opted for the $188 omakase. While I understand omakase means 'leave it to the chef', I cannot comprehend why the others get the 'kokabu' for the same set but when I asked for it, I was being charged for it, where the rest got it as part of menu.

The other turn off was the long waiting time for items to be served, it was full house.. abt 18 -20 pax, but there was 4 chefs running ... well, I guess good thing must wait.

Nonetheless, the food was really good and fresh, nicely presented, and the waitress were prompt in service as usual, credit to the staffs."
Umami!,"My first omakase experience and it was amazing! Sashimi was fresh, sushi was very well done. I personally liked their special dish, the Chilled Thin Udon in Truffle Oil. Definitely worth a try :)"
Great lunch,"This place is just perfect. Excellent food, great chefs, top service. Small restaurant but the set up is just awesome. Probably need reservation, we were just lucky I guess getting a seat when we arrived."
Family Dinner,I like the casual atmosphere where you can see the chef prepare the food. A bit rowdy the night we were there as there was a hen party. Very one was quite high with too much sake. Chefs are really friendly and engaging.
Only regulars,Food was average. There are better value places. Not good to go with clients unless you are a regular as they get all the attention. Noisy and cramp. Wait staff is attentive.
Nice and fresh seafood,A hidden gem at the area. I won't get to know of this place everytime I passes by till my friend recommended. Omakase dinning! Every dish serve is fresh and good! Chef is very entertaining and I reckon most are regular customers. Need to make a reservation as the place is rather small. One downside is it can get rather rowdy when it fully packed due to the small area. But thumb up for the freshness of food
Wonderful Experience,"Place is small and cramped, just like a true blue eatery in Japan. The chefs are very friendly and take the trouble to ensure that all our similar dishes are served at the same time. Freshness is guaranteed; had the best time savouring every dish. Depending on other patrons, it can be very rowdy (which can be fun!) or private. Worthy visit indeed!"
Some Hits & Misses,"We went early to try the omakase meal that came up to $80ish per person. Had a total of 9 courses. Service and plating were mostly great. Food wise, there were hits and misses. Generally a tate salty for me. Lower price omakase meal average at best. Would need to go the the full price menu for the more ""refine"" dishes. 1) salad with Japanese vinegrette was refreshing. (2) cod fish with sweet and sour vinegar was great - a flavour I have not tasted before (3) sashimi was excellent - especially the yellow fish roe and slightly charred swordfish. Yum! (4) The salmon steak was overdone and rather salty so for me definitely a miss. (5) love the chawanmushi with a touch of truffle oil. (6) tempura was my least favourite - batter was flat. (7) miso soup had good flavour with very smooth tofu. (8) sushi was just above average. (9) dessert was kind of disappointing as it was just a scoop of yuzu sorbet in a small clay bowl. All in all, a meal that started very well and ended kind of flat."
Ok Food but Awful Ambience and Hosting,"We came here based on much of the positive comments on TA but this is a very bad experience of how not to run a Jap restaurant, so bad that we felt like just paying halfway and leaving.

The positives :
The chirashi zushi was really quite good. So was the inaniwa udon. Ebi tempura was so so. The omakase set was much touted but prob average in quality but took way too long esp as the main chef wad busy drinking and toasting his regular customers. Not once did he come over to say hello. Stuckup.

Anyway the negatives:
Though we had a reservation, it seems like regular and famous personalities can just drop by like flies and squeeze into already the limited space. At last count, there were more than 30 customers squeezed inside the restaurant. Am sure the fire safety limit have been breached but the mgt seemed nonchalant about it. Just busy getting adding more and more chairs to the chef's table. They shldnt take patrons safety for granted esp with open fires and grills in the open kitchen. If there was a fire,,,,long narrow restaurant with only one small door and 50 people trying to get out..

There were a few TV personalities and some Taiwanese regulars present and they turned the whole place into one big Ginza bar. Singing, boisterous shouting, loud cackling by half drunk customers...this is really not the right place to have an omakase dinner. Worse of all, the chef owner was going around pouring whiskey with this bunch of regular customers, who were all getting high and tipsy. Like a typical sleazy ktv lounge...papasan force-selling drinks...

And the boss was trying to impress his audience by boasting all the whos who who had dined here and who was coming to dinner later that evening. The last thing I want when I dine at a fancy restaurant is to hv an advance propanganda team broadcasting our coming and breaching our privacy.

Service was painfully slow. But who could help it when the boss is busy entertaining his friends and ignoring the bulk of us. Worse, for the same menu, his friends got 2 slices of the Jap melon whilst we only hv 1 slice like the rest of us. Pity the service staff who were trying their best to cope with this dysfunctional and poorly run restaurant. The noise was so loud no one coyld hear what we were saying and we couldnt even hear what the waitresses were trying to explain what was being served.

Perhaps mr lawrence chia shld take a philgramage to Japan and see how professional michellin starred Jap restaurants are run...professionally. He should remember all clients who walk thru the dinner paid good money and shld be treated fairly and to hv their deserved dining experience, not to feel like a 2nd class peasant who had barged into a private drinking party. They would never allow a few boisterous customers (no matter who) to spoil the experience of the majority of the patrons. But cant help it jn this case, it is the owner himsrlf who was keeping the party going. The other guests who were sitting alongside with us also sighed with the same sadness. Good evening wasted. No matter how good is the food, it never taste good in a loud bar environment. That is why to date, no bar ever won a michellin star. No one can eat well in a place like this.

Terrible experience. First and last time we would be here. Unless you are part of his regular party."
GOOD ATMOSPHERE AND FRESH DISHES,"A casual yet high quality omakase ingredients , min 200 per pax excluding drinks, hence if you feeling a little budget, go for the early omakase dinner or just order ala carte and enjoy the drinks. Try ask for counter seats."
Cozy Experience,Friendly staff who make customers feel at home every single visit. Omakase always surprises the taste buds!
Nice lunch set,A nice variety of set lunch to choose from. Small restaurant with authentic Japanese cuisine. Service is friendly and efficient. Sashimi were delicious. Must book during week day
Excellent food and atmosphere!,"I have been to Shinzo about 10 times in the past 6 months and this place is amazing!
The food is the finest I have found in Singapore (below 50++ per person). Everything is prepared in front of you when you order, with excellent products!
The salmon set lunch for 38++ is great with 6 dishes of great taste. The sashimi melts in your mouth... the staff is very caring and adorable!
I cannot say anything negative about this place !! Just try it for yourself ;)
Make sure you make a reservation, even for lunch!"
Must visit!,"The lunch sets are a steal at 38/45/68SGD++.The main dish (unagi/tempura/sashimi/chirashi/wagyu, kurobuta cats) come with delightful salad of greens, seaweed and kani, chawan sushi (easily one of the best in Singapore!), miso soup (the one served today used a savoury fish stock), slices of ripe watermelon and gala melon, and hot/cold roasted barley tea. The place is modestly appointed (generally a sushi counter) and seats are limited, so it is wise to secure reservations. Service is not the most brisk, but friendly. The early-bird omakase dinner (68SGD++) is something to try on the next visit! There are bento sets too. Highly recommendable."
Great!,"Been to Shinzo a couple of times. And they never fail to impress me with the quality of food. But this time, I felt rushed to finish my food and can't enjoy myself. But overall, still satisfied with the food."
A chance meeting with many friends,"A good friend invited me and my colleague to lunch at this place after I shared that I wanted to have light meal. Was expecting a simple cafe or salad place but it turned out to a Japanese restaurant along Carpenter St. As we stepped in, my colleague met his old classmates, I met my friend and his wife on a lunch date, after that my colleague met another old friend. This is really a great place for chance meeting. Back to the food, we tried the Shashimi set lunch which comprised: salad, shashimi (salmon, tuna, seared scallop, prawn, sword fish, squid - the seafood was very fresh), tempura (5 pcs assorted), tuna maki (6 pcs), bowl of noodles, green tea ice cream. I think the pricing was S$36. A very filling lunch, not so simple and light at the end as I could not finish the noodles and left one tuna maki untouched. Service was very friendly and the chef (guess he is also the boss) met us and passed us his name card. Thanked us for the visit and hope we could continue to support him again.

Will remember this place for the things that happened today. A meeting place of good friends over good food."
A Little Gem,"Returned to this little gem again. The food is authentic and the cosy atmosphere is great. Overall, superb value for money."
Friend's Birthday celebration,"1st time here, heard good reviews about the Omakase & decided to try it with friends. Never regretted my choice, the sashimi are fresh, all the dishes are tasty & yummy! The chefs & waitresses are all very friendly. If you are considering big group gathering here, bear in mind that the restaurant is set for Omakase cuisine,as such, conversations with friends can be tricky especially if the crowd is rowdy at times. Overall, great place for Omakase dining!"
Awesome,Great food at great prices. Will definitely be back again for more. Seared scallops with foie gras takes the cake!
An adventure of the 'heart',"Food is lovingly prepared, reflecting the friendly nature and warm embrace of the restaurant. Drawing out the best of the seasonal items, we were treated to a scenic culinary adventure... Absolutely great!"
Yummy lunch sets,"Had lunch here with my colleagues. We choose the set lunches (around $38), we had the fried pork and the chirashi ones. Both are delicious but the thing I loved the most is the sashimi that came with the sets. Super fresh and very nice texture. Highly recommended!
It's a small place so I would recommend booking. Service level is decent."
Great service friendly chefs. Non pretentious.,First time there and loved it. Will be returning with rest of family. Look for Cayden - friendly dude who served us.
Satisfactory,Shinzo is one of my favorite rastaurants. I recommend early bird omakase dinner menu due to its reasonable price.
Fantastic return to the restaurant,Food was delicious and service was great. Service was prompt and everyone was friendly. Would definitely return in the near future..
Food was superb. Ambience not so.,"Food was fantastic and preparation was fast. However there were screaming children playing in the corner, ,causing a huge disturbance to our conversation in such an enclosed space.

On top of that, halfway through the meal the music suddenly blared out causing a shock and making it close to impossible to talk. We had to ask the waitress to turn down the volume after awhile. This really soured our experience there."
Favourite Sushi Bar,Chef Lawrence & Daniel create a Tokyo experience in Singapore's Chinatown. Go before 7 for a cheaper alternative to their high-priced omakase dinners.
A cosy yet classy experience,"We had the early bird omakase special to celebrate our anniversary. There were a total of 9 courses including dessert, with each dish meticulously prepared and served with a smile and an explanation as to the ingredients of the dish. Our favourite dish was probably the cold silken tofu topped with century egg puree and egg roe - every mouthful was bursting with umami/sweet flavour! It was also an interesting experience dining while watching the chefs exhibiting their superb culinary skills in preparing the upcoming courses. The chefs were personable and looking around the place we could see that other diners were clearly regulars, as they seemed very comfortable in conversation with the chefs. All in all a cosy and classy experience - would definitely recommend shinzo to friends and family!"
SGD68++ omakase promo is value for money,"I think it is value for money. The ingredients cannot be that premium given it is priced much lower than the usual 168++ and up. I particularly like the shashimi, which was fresh, the fried pork cutlets, and the chawanmushi with the flavourful broth. Overall, good flavours. I will recommend it"
Good value omakase,"Great quality of food, value for money. Serving was attentive and friendly. Food was not rushed and one hour is just perfect"
Tasty food and good service,"Fun experience and definitely worth it for the early-bird price. Would have been nice to be seated in front of the chef though, so we could enjoy watching the prep."
Absolutely mouthwatering,Tried the Omakase & it is the most yummiest Japanese cuisine I ever tried. Food r fresh & tastefully prepared & presented. Chefs & servers there r polite & professional. Even diners there r friendly.
Food was excellent.,"We had the $68 early bird special. Very good value, the food was excellent!
Sashimi was fresh, especially love the grilled cod fish. The miso soup was excellent to end the meal. Toilet is also clean.
Although service was attentive it was perfunctory and service staffs drag their feet which is irritating.
The sliding door of the only entrance of the restaurant was hard to close, at such warm air rushes in as a discomfort of customer sitting at counter nearest to the entrance.
Hokkien seems to be the most comfortable language among themselves and the customers."
I will visit again!!!,Very friendly chefs. Food is very fresh and affordable!!! I feel more like their friend than a customer. Definitely recommending it to others!
Will definitely visit again,Enjoyed their set lunch and sushi a-la carte. Good food and great service. wish they would open on Sunday's too.
Awesome omakase,Omakase experience at Shinzo was certainly an unforgettable one! My personal favourite is the Uni Chawanmushi which is pure decadent goodness!
"Superb, Impressive and Friendly",Food and presentation was excellent. We enjoyed the warm and friendly atmosphere. And lots of Sake choices to enhance the experience!
amazing food,"the food was fresh and good. We had the lunch set, which was value for money. We went on a Saturday, the place was empty and we had the whole place for ourselves."
A Jewel in an unexpected location,"Had meals several time at Shinzo. The place is quite small as it can sit only about 20 odds guests at the counter. You need to have prior booking otherwise you can't get yourself a sea. It was a good experience as all of guests are facing an open kitchen and you can see 4 or 5 chefs cooking your food. 2 or 3 at the sushi counter as the counter is really long. One chef in charge of cooking the tempura and grill and another chef in charge of cooking, either steaming or boiling or nitsuke, etc.
All the food served are fresh and good quality and we really enjoy very much.

I enjoyed most are the sashimi and sushi, very fresh and good quality. All the chefs have very good rapport with the guests and you shall feel very enjoyable talking to the chefs. The chefs will also make sure to get any feedback on the food."
Will return for more,We tried the early bird Omakase menu for our first visit there. Everything was good and we are going back for the full course Omakase!
Great Experience,"First time visiting this restaurant and having Omakase dinner. Although we were seated at the smaller second counter, it afforded us more interaction with Chef Jack Chang. The experience with Jack was great as did cater the dinner to your liking and dislikes. Also, when he explains some of the dishes and the subtle flavours like the umi.

Each dish served was fairly unique and some were his own personal creations. The Shiga beef pieces just melted in your mouth. The sushi and sashimi were very fresh even with fishes that traditionally have some fishy smell.

Overall the atmosphere was great even with the main seating counter full of people booked for a major birthday celebration. Chef Lawrence even made the effort to come over and get to know everyone by name."
