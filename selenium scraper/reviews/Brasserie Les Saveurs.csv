Beautiful breakfast,excellent food and service. The servers were extremely helpful and everything was brought out fresh and quickly.
Best Breakfast Experience,"I feel like a VVIP the moment I stepped into this place . Every staff is so attentive, friendly and welcoming!

The food portion is huge, spread is good with lots of varieties. Everything is good with the exception of laksa which didn‚Äôt taste like the local laksa.

Special thanks to Saravanan, he‚Äôs a GEM of this place."
Indian Sous Chef - Kamal Hossen,"Excellent service, friendly, helpful, and warm. Very nice place and everyone is very helpful, great place to be."
Excellent service and ambience,Came here for my birthday dinner on 18 Jan and the service was top notch. Hucksen and Kartie both offered to take photos for us and it was very well done. Food and wine are good and very value for money with the Amex promotion. Highly recommend!
"Great food, ambience and service","The food was very delicious, I especially enjoyed the lobster bisque and the steak. The service staff Manesh was also very hospitable. Overall a very enjoyable meal here."
Very Noisy Ambience,We reserved a table of 6pp for dinner with friends at 8pm. There was a karaoke session above us that was very noisy & we could barely hear each other without speaking loudly. Timeliness of food was bad. Taste was just average. Very low value & all of us were very disappointed with the whole experience.
"Good to come for lunch - quiet, classic, delightful.","Came for lunch. I had French onion soup, pork loin and cr√®me br√ªl√©e while my friend had a lamb rack. All items were perfect, including the complimentary home made bread. Now, it‚Äôs not that common for everything to be perfect so this is really good. The soup was rich in onions and texture; the pork loin was splendidly matched with an apple sauce; the cr√®me br√ªl√©e was surprisingly a generous portion and its crispy caramelized sugar was heavenly (note: i have a sweet tooth). My friend loved her lamb too.

Ambience was classic and service was attentive. Quite quiet for lunch on a weekday so I guess we made the right choice of day to come.

Prices reasonable for a place like this."
Great breakfast and service!,Suman was such a great host and he toook care of us while there at the restaurant and checked in on us! Amazing rooms and beautiful interior
High tea,"Celebrated my 3 years old daughter birthday and indeed an excellent choice. A surprise cake and bear for the little one which shine her day.

Love the pastry and especially, the soup with soft boiled egg.

Special mention to the crew - Manish, Kartie and Bessie whom provide excellent services!

Strongly recommend and will definitely revisit"

Dinner at St Regis,Amazing food and service by Juvan! Definitely would come here again. Very genuine and excellent service.
Anniversary Meal.,"It was a Splendid Experience. Juvan our server, he was Impressive and Attentive to details. He was always checkin in on us ensuring we had enough water, and to ensure we were ready for next course meal, he also repeated our orders to ensure everything was well detailed including the cranberry sauce I wanted for my Main Course Turkey dish, sadly the kitchen ran out but it still tasted very delish. My husband ordered lamb rack, he wrote down exact details on how my husband would want the lamb to be done, juicy, soft and tender. Such Impeccable service. He deserves to be promoted as he was also very prompt whenever we called out to him. He made our Anniversary a Special one today. Thanks Juvan."
Sunday Afternoon Tea Festive Menu,"Manish was excellent! He was very friendly and approachable. As we have 3 young kids, Manish entertained them and gave in to their requests by giving free juices for the little ones and chocolate treats at the end of our afternoon tea. Thank you, Manish and team!

Food portion is very good as well."
Shout out to Sous Chef Kamal,"Breakfast being the most important meal of the day, is especially critical when on business schedule. Chef Kamal did an excellent job to make sure the dishes are up to the standard, if any issues he made sure he would personally address it immediately with his friendly and courteous hospitality. Really got a good start to the day because of it."
Excellent experience,We had the high tea set. The staff is very attentive. He offered to reheat the scone for us without us requesting for it. The tea was nice and refreshing. The pastries are delicious especially the Asparagus & Truffle Cream Cheese Tartlet.
Fantastic!,"Went for high tea with my group of friends and had a great time with great food! the staff were very accommodating and never failed in their excellent service. The scones were amazing, especially when warm. My favorite was the chocolate cake that they surprised me with for my birthday. 10/10 and would definitely come back again. Thanks to the staff who were amazing."
Great service,"Great going
Mr Kamal the chef did a fantastic job as with young children and traveling our breakfast everyday was sorted .
Thank you"
Best part of our stay at The St. Regis Singapore,"Hands down, the best part of our stay at The St.Regis Singapore. This was our regular breakfast stop. Kamal, the sous chef, and Yan, server, provided above and beyond service. Their positive attitude and desire to provide great service was very impressive. The array of food provided at the breakfast buffet was mouthwatering. I generally eat very clean but I couldn't help but indulge in all the delightful local treats and fresh food present. The selection ranged from local Singapore food to Western options. There was also an option that was included in the buffet where you could order off a menu.
I would highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast!"
Excellent service and great food,"Manish and Amy made our dining experience a memorable one. The service level was excellent and we were very well taken cared of despite this being our first time here.

Food quality and the new menu is living up to the hype. Wine selection is decent can see the effort being out in to curate. Had the t bone steak and apple pie. Both were very nicely done. Definitely will return"
Epic Birthday Celebration,"Kudos to Inna for the fantastic service at Brassiere Les Saveurs , St. Regis Hotel in Singapore! Inna and the staff took great care of me for an entire week as I was there to celebrate a milestone birthday! The buffet breakfast was wonderful and Sous Chef Kamal is just so wonderful and prepared the most delicious meals including a most delicious red lentil soup ! Yum ! yum ! I will definitely come back the next time I‚Äôm In Singapore!! Sincerely , Lisa aka Double Nickles"

"Great staff, Could do better with the food.","The staff were very helpful and attentive, especially to Amy and Christine. Thank you.

The food could really do better.
Eg1 Foie gras was shaved out, not in a nice charred piece with melon.
Eg2 Escargots was undercooked and still squishy/ slimy with no herb/ butter flavour.
Eg3 Cote de bouef had not enough salt or char."
Great staff,"Amy was our service staff. She was non native but immaculate in her attentiveness and kindness is every sense.

Perfect Ambience and Great Food!,"We had a lovely dinner with oysters, foie gras to start off. Pork loin and Hokkaido scallops for mains. Also enjoyed with a bottle of house wine - Sauvignon Blanc. Everything was delicious amd the service was great! Quite pricey but with AMEX love dining discounts, reasonable at average $130 per pax."
Birthday high tea with BFF. Served by friendly Amy!,"High tea strongly recommended.. The savory, i like best is the smoked salmon and truffle egg.
As for the sweet matcha bar, manjari cake, exotic tartlet are very good cos not too sweet. The ambience is elegant and lavish."
Food has too much salt and staff not really aware of what is going on,"The food at the buffet is average at best, salty and not very exciting. It took us a couple of days to find items we like to eat that did not contain all the salt. Asking for coffee is another nightmare since it takes half hour or more to get a cup and the servers really have no clue what you are asking about. Same for a glass of water. The sous chef is walking around the entire breakfast area and does not know much about what types of food they really serve. I have never seen a sous chef spending the entire mealtime walking around, and not be in the kitchen helping to cook the food. Also, when he stands at your table and sees dirty dishes you think he would pick it up and take it away. No, he does not do that, he lets the service staff do it when they get a chance which can be your entire meal. So, the so-called great buffet breakfast though plenty of options was not worth it. And the items are the same every day no change at all what you can choose other than what they have on the menu or at the buffet table and all those items are the same every day. Even a Hampton inn changes items daily. We were going to try to have dinner at the restaurant as well but after the breakfast experience, we decided to skip the potential experience."
Good Food and Service Provided,"Went for lunch with my 2 othrr colleagues and all of us ordered the 3 course set meal which comes one an appetiser, mains and dessert.

Had steak was slightly under seasoned and preferred to have more charring on it. Nonetheless the meal was great overall.

The staffs and servers there were very nice and patient with my table, servicing our requests promptly and positively with kindness and with a smile. Winty was our main server and she was very friendly that checks up on our table and asking us if we have any issues or request. She has great foresight as well, knowing what we were going to request after the first time. She also was very understanding and make us feel comfortable as some of our request might seem embarassing for us as the staffs were busy preparing for high tea time service but Winty was very patient and assuring us that it was no troubles at all.

Overall the food and ambience of the place was great and the service provided by all the staffs and Winty were very good. Keep it up and we will visit again in the future!"
Excellent service from Jessa,Excellent service from Jessa and team. My son had a most wonderful and memorable birthday celebration on the Sunday bunch. Thank you ! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Enjoyable evening made perfect by staff of Les Saveurs.,"My husband and I wanted to spend a quiet dinner with a little celebration between us.

Good Experience,"The food was delicious, definitely worth the price. Service Staff Joshua and Hucksen are friendly and they provide good service throughout the whole dining experience."
Lovely high tea,"Very lovely selection of high tea treats (mostly sweet but good spread of savoury), friendly and extremely helpful wait staff service as well. Very nice ambience with live piano music. Personally would not recommend having lunch before the tea, it‚Äôs very filling."
Splendeur!,"The atmosphere is nice, great to relax and eat. Afternoon tea service was tr√®s magnifique especially the staff service was prompt and attentive. Will come again in future!"
Enthusiastic Service and Great Food!,"The service was really good; the staff providing recommendations on the food to ensure we are not eating beyond our gastric limits. They have also made the experience enjoyable by their enthusiastic service throughout the 4-course meal.

The food is amazing as well! Will come back for another round! The only feedback I have will be that the soup in the 4-course meal (Soupe au Pistou) tasted great, but the odd smell did not complement well with the aromatic taste of the soup. It didn‚Äôt really affect the overall dining experience regardless."
Thoughtful Service,We had a lovely dinner at Brasserie Les Saveurs celebrating our anniversary and the team made sure they made the evening special. Thank you for your wonderful service . We will be back !
Good ambience and attentive staff,"My parents gave me a surprise dinner at this lovely restaurant.

Many thanks to Sophia who saw to my birthday arrangements with a lovely cocktail and cake, all complimentary!"
"Excellent Food , Nice Ambience & Great Service!!!","Excellent food , great service !!!

Was part of the supper club and Went there for my birthday on 8 Jul 2022 with husband and 2 kids aged 13 & 7 . Ordered the burrata tomato salad , lobster bisque , barramundi and sea bass mains and creme br√ªl√©e dessert for my husband and myself and the fish and chips for my kids. Must say very impressed - with the food quality , service , responsiveness of the booking and reservations for the dinner arrangements and that they paid attention to details - had kids menu etc . Special mention goes to Joshua , Amy and team who took very good care of us. impressed with Joshua and his service attitude - he paid attention to every detail and was very responsive - from replenishing our olive oil to drinks to offering us complimentary carpark coupons to offering a handbag placeholder plus handing over to me the cake that I had mistakenly left behind ! The supper club membership , restaurant food and service is commendable !! Would surely recommend to anyone looking for good quality food , nice ambience and great service !! Well done brassiere lee Saveur n St Regis !!!"
Parents Wedding Anniversary,"Was searching a place for my parent‚Äôs wedding anniversary dinner and chanced upon this restaurant from others‚Äô reviews. The choice of restaurant did not disappoint. Ambience was very intimate, relaxed and perfect for a nice evening with family. High ceiling and beautiful interior architecture with jazz background music brought us back to a classic era. We ordered the burrata cheese, French onion soup, lobster bisque, escargot, ribeye, lamb saddle, pork lion and the cr√®me br√ªl√©e and house wine for 4 people. The drop in a star would be attributed to some of the food served were slightly cold and might need a tad bit more salt. Empty table plates were not cleared and started to clutter as well as the night progressed. However, overall I would still recommend to give this a try for a nice evening with family. If I had to choose, mains were the best. Service was awesome, staff were nice and approachable. Car park redemption was provided as well. Thank you!"
Great place to celebrate!,"Great hospitality, food, ambience! Mains were juicy and tasty. Soup was hearty. Burrata was a little sour though. Warm cr√®me br√ªl√©e."
Breakfast,"Staying at the St Regis hotel for a week and this french restaurant doubles up as the breakfast restaurants. Like some other places, this is a hybrid system - some items like fruit, pastry and drinks are buffet style. Heavier items like noodles, omelette etc are ordered a la carte. Good selection, quality and service"
Excellent,"Went to st Regis hotel for staycay and I am SOOooo in loved with the breakfast buffet! Other than looking pretty, the pastries are so delicious! Service was great~ Upon arrival, the staff greeted us and asked us for the drinks first (I had st Regis blend tea and it‚Äôs great with the pastries, it has mild sweet aroma and not bitter) and also recommending us some food to try on. They have raw food, smoked salmon, salad, Siew Mai etc‚Ä¶ They also offered local dishes like laksa, char kway teow.. but I still like pastries the best! And there is fruits like watermelon and banana! I would definitely come back again just for the food even if I‚Äôm not staying at the hotel. But be early as the crowd appears after 830am and it will be full~"
Delicious Breakfast Buffet,"Went for breakfast buffet. There was a wide spread of selection, including buffet style and ala-carte style menu. Loved the epicurean eggs and pancakes from the ala-carte menu. The pastries selections were all extremely delicious. The service provided was top notch and ambience of the space was elegant and spacious."
Restaurant food and service was very good.,"We just celebrated our wedding anniversary at the restaurant and was served by wonderful service staff there, especially Manesh, whose service was impeccable."
"Great ambience, service and food",Very enjoyable and peaceful place to have a meal. The selection on the menu is a little limited but there are more unique options and combinations. I had the pork loin and enjoyed the combination of the puree and jus. The staff were very polite and professional.
"Good food, good ambience","Nice ambience, great service and great food! Enjoyed a peaceful dinner away from the hustle and bustle orchard road. Definitely worth a visit."
Lovely evening at Brasserie Les Saveurs with our family.,"Manish, Amy and Hucksen were a dream. They were so kind and gracious to our family, especially my little one, taking heed to her needs. They made lovely recommendations and they were all spot on. It was perfect dinner."
The Food and service are average,Afternoon tea are over prices. The food are just normal pastry and the drink is normal the coffee is not normal expect for the tea. The services are slow. Will not recommend to come again. As this is way too expensive and it is under the expectation.
