Classy place for a drink,"Very nice place to hang out after work for people working at the Marina area. The ambience is rather classy & service is not bad. The downside is the so called happy hour price is only a couple of bucks off the regular price. We were trying to use Entertainer voucher so we were not allowed to order drink under HH price. Then we decided to order drinks first while waiting for a friend. We were not allowed to settle the drinks using separate bill before ordering the food. In the end, we just walked out. This is rather inflexible. We went to another place for dinner in at the end which turned out to be very nice ."
"Casual, but they take their food and drinks seriously","The menu here is very literal, so if you order a rack of lamb or the green curry snapper, that is what you will get on the plate with no sides or garnishes.

That makes eating here a little more expensive than it first appears, because you will find that a $35 main dish should really be paired with a $15 side.

Our favourites from the night actually came from the Bar Snacks menu, and I would recommend looking in there for an interesting and reasonably priced selection.

The standard of food here is great. The kitchen is adept with sauces and marinades and that lifts up the entire experience with some fantastic ingredient and taste combinations.

It is equal parts bar for busy CBD executives and restaurant, so the drinks are on-point and their happy hour runs until 9pm. Staff are casual and friendly but know what they are doing.

It’s hard to go wrong with a good kitchen, good bar and good staff. We had a great meal and I’m sure you will too."
A gem in the Marina area,"One of the better eateries in the Marina area. Not for daily lunches as it’s not cheap and a bit out of the way. However, for the occasional special occasion, it’s highly recommended, as the food is quite innovative and very good, and prices are reasonable for the quality. The grilled octopus is top class. Friendly and efficient service staff."
Rare Gem in CBD,"One of the rare find in CBD, The Spot has one of the best octopus and Black
Cod in Singapore. As a pescatarian, I have been to many restaurants and The Spot is just Spot On! Coupled with great ambience and service, that’s a winning formulae. What a great find and I’ll certainly be coming back."
"Great food, great ambience, great service!",Main course and appetizers were great. Good recommendations by Sed and great service from Aravin! We enjoyed the drinks as well.
Billing tricks.,The cashier inserted two extra items in the bill that were not ordered or consumed. Have to be careful!
Great until payment,"Food was great and plated well. Service was decent with some slight hiccups until payment. Counter staff was rude and accused me of not informing staff earlier I was using a 1-1 Birthday Promo from Kris+. That is false. I reminded staff three times: Once in my reservations, upon arrival and upon ordering."
Great atmosphere and good food,"Wife was in town so we decided to pop by for dinner. Loved the novelty and selection of great wine bottles from the bottle shop attached to the restaurant.

Reservation was quick & easy via Chope. Waiting staff were attentive and the food is great. We selected a bottle of Bordeaux and the staff from the bottle shop quickly prepped the bottle and poured half of it into a decanter.

This is not a place where you expect a sommelier to make their recommendations to accompany your dishes, but more of a pick your own bottle & order your dishes or vice versa. I enjoyed the casual & no frills atmosphere and dining experience.

Definitely would be back to try other dishes here.

The kingfish ceviche, and the tenderloin with mole sauce are a must try!"
Wonderful dinner experience!,"It's my first visit to this place where I celebrated hubby's birthday. Would like to give thumbs up to staff crew who made it a pleasant dining experience for us tonight, especially Lyncy who has been very proactive in giving us recommendations and attentive to our dietary requirements. Additionally, the food here is creative and nicely executed. I especially love the iberico chorizo and the Panna cotta ended our meal with refreshing tastebuds. The dishes are also nicely presented like art. Love how the team here took pride in their work and overall attentive staff looking after us."
"Great food, overall positive experience","Food was good in variety and great taste. Service was a little peculiar, staff was proactive but did not talk in most junctures, lack of verbal cues. But other than that, was a smooth experience."
"Food Good, Wait Staff Not So Much","I thought the food was good. Some hits with the dessert (panna cotta) and the starters were excellent. But the lobster in the lobster capellini was a little overdone and hence rubbery. However what was really lacking was the wait staff's attitude. He was very impatient, didn't bother to greet us (let alone sound polite) and worst of all, walked away in the middle of taking our order. Pity, as I wasn't the only one who noticed, which made it all the more awkward with my guests. Whatever..."
A great lunch!,"As i was in the area, I decided to buy a friend his birthday meal for lunch. While we were perusing the menu, the 3 course lunch caught our eye. As my friend was not a dessert person, he asked if he could change the dessert for another appetiser. The very friendly wait staff told us it was possible. After a while, we were told that unfortunately, we could not request for an appetiser to replace the dessert. My friend then ordered the dessert to make it a 3 course meal. However, when the lunch was served, we were given the second appetiser which was confusing. When asked, we were told to continue with our lunch while they sorted it out. It was later revealed that there was a mistake in the order and that it was reinforced we could not have a second appetiser to replace the dessert.
How it was resolved was that were were charged one pax with a 3 course and the other pax with a 2 course with the second appetiser as an ala carte. While we acknowledge that it was a mistake on the part of the wait staff, frankly the service recovery was a little disappointing. Nonetheless, the food was excellent. The beef tartare was moorish while the tri tip with the buak keluak choclate mole was the star of the lunch. It was a god lunch to celebrate a friend's birthday."
Great ambience and good food,Enjoyed good food and great service by Vincent Khoo at Spot. He recommend the main course Red snapper and desserts which were good.
Happy,We had a wonderful time at The Spot. The Lamb loin Chef's special of the day was very delicious! They gave us a free dessert also for our Wedding Anniversary ❤️. We would like to say thank you to Francis who really gave his best in serving us and checking on us if we need something until the very end. Thank you so much! Thank you to Chope app also
Great place to celebrate birthday,"I came here for the lunch to celebrate my birthday.
Staff was very attentive and know the menu well when I asked him about the food. Food was tasty and great presentation.
Special thanks to Mr. Vincent Khoo who made our time a very pleasant one."
Great service and food,This is my return visit with my family. Still the great food and service. Never fail us. Keep it up!
The kind Vincent Khoo at The Spot,"We went to The Spot on Wed 15 Dec for lunch, we had such a great time! The food was awesome and Vincent Khoo has been very helpful, patient and kind with us. We were grateful to be served by him, we just loved his energy and positive attitude, and it was contagious to us!"
Saturday lunch,"Good food and service as always, our services Justin was extremely attentive and patient, highly recommend!"
5 course set lunch menu for 2,"Great food, great service. Server Lyncy was attentive and friendly. Good ambience tucked away in a corner Marina One."
"Restaurant Week - excellent food, attentive staff","We had the Restaurant Week set menu, and it did not disappoint! The food was delicious, well presented and the service was 5-star. We were served by Lyncy - her efficiency and cheefulness made our evening all the more pleasant! Happy to return, with more friends."
Great,"Great food, Great service. Friendly staff especially Lyncy who served us. We ordered the Angus Short rib pastrami. No regrets."
Great experience,"Excellent food, cocktails & service from Jannah. We enjoyed the appetisers, fish and delicious cocktails. We will be back again."
Top Spot,"Was here to try the food with my friend during restaurant week. Ambience is nice and quiet really comfortable and enjoyable, was told that pre-covid it will be packed and hard to get a table. A far cry on the day I visited, only 2 or 3 tables were taken. Took the chance to try the very interesting menu due to restaurant week. I must say I was thoroughly impressed with the surprise in store for each of the dish. The chef has put in a lot of effort to make sure each dish comes with a slight twist in a good way.

The bread kicked us off delightfully, there was a clever blend of fruits in some of the dishes, adding to palate of taste. Foie gras, scallop as appetiser was sumptuous. The steak and trout didn't disappoint either.. the desserts capped it off nicely.. would have been better if there is a cup of coffee to end off.. nonetheless, impressed enough to want to return someday to try the full menu.."
The Spot hits the right (dining) spot!,Lovely restaurant with cosy ambience. The food is delicious and the service is impeccable. Lyncy is friendly and attentive and saw to our every need and made us feel very comfortable. It was a lovely night out for a couple date. We enjoyed ourselves!
"The Spot, aptly named!","Intimate and quiet restaurant, perfect venue for the night. Not sure if it was due to the current restrictions.

Had great wine, great food, great service by Dwayne! He was earnest, cheery and friendly. It’s such service that we really appreciate.

Wonderfully surprised when they came out of the kitchen with a complimentary slice of cake and sung a birthday song. Thanks to Jannah for confirming the reservation prior to dinner!"
Great food and services,"The food are delicious, portion is just right with excellent services! Special thanks to Justin, he articulates the dishes very well and we had an enjoyable dining experience. Selection on the menu is limited but it's about quality over quantity!"
One of the top restaurants in Singapore,Extremely friendly staff. Great mix of Western and Asian kitchen. First class preparation of food. Attached win cellar with exquisite vines.
Great short rib,"Great short rib and Jannah was a great host! Great wine, great food, great service! What else can you ask for ?"
Great food and great service.,Really like the food and service and the staff took time to explain the dishes for us. Will be visiting again soon after the COVID situation ease.
My 2nd visit and still amazing,Fine dining standard and the set lunch is definitely value for the price. Service is also excellent and desert is also wonderful.
Exceeded expectations,"Great dinner experience at the Spot. Restaurant is nested in Marina One which is a quiet CBD corner. Ordered 2 mains (Duck breast, Snapper) and a side to share (Beef Tartare). Food quality is high, plating on point and service is excellent! Value for money even without the Entertainer discount."
Really my favorite!,If you are looking for a real satisfying experience you must visit this place. The food is amazing the staff absolutely adorable and the ambiente verx nice!
Best western restaurant in Singapore,"This has got to be the best fusion western restaurant in the whole of Singapore, even better than many far more expensive places like labyrinth etc. I've eaten here multiple times and have never been disappointed. Service is consistently excellent, food is incredible.

Just showing 2 pictures from my latest visit:
The lobster capellini comes with a generous amount of lobster and roe. Capellini is al dente with the right amount of sauce. The thinly sliced cucumber strips also add a refreshing taste and a nice variation to the texture.

The pastrami is very tender and juicy. The foie gras is pan seared to perfection, slightly crispy on the outside, and melt-in-your-mouth smooth on the inside. Accompanying veggies also help to balance out taste and texture for the meal.

Overall: just amazing. They change their menu all the time so you might not be able to find the same dishes if you visit in a few months. Though from my experience, everything (food, drinks) taste good."
Great service and food,"We have been introduced to this restaurant through some social media a few months back. Planned to go there to try but was derailed by the COVID-19 heighten alert restriction. Finally went down with my wife to grab a bite on a Sunday afternoon.

Being in the Central Business District, it is a wonderful place to avoid crowd, but it is bad for business. Besides us, there was a few other tables, all limited to 2 pax due to the restriction.

We were served by a very knowledgeable young man, Justin. We ordered food from the special Truffle menu as well as the regular menu. All the food were well presented with wonderful experience for the tastebuds.

- The Oysters were juicy and sweet, and the yuzu sauce made all the difference.
- Red snapper in green curry was a great paring with very fresh fish and mildly and perfectly spiced up green curry.
- The Licorice ice cream is unique, well presented, and gave you a lingering nice after taste.

Very attentive service by Justin, Jonnah and all the other staff in the restaurant.

Will be back with the family!"
Two fantastic visits!,"This is the second time I visited The Spot, returning with a friend this time after a fantastic dinner experience with my husband about a year ago, and both visits were wonderful, both in terms of the food and the service.

I was happy to see an almost entirely new menu of delicious items to try, with some favourites still available on the Bar Snacks menu. One of the things I enjoy about The Spot is being able to order from both the Bar Snacks and the main a la carte dining menu when seated in the restaurant, meaning there is a lot of choice and you can try lots of small plates as part of your meal. Though it was a struggle to choose between all of the tempting dishes, my friend and I finally managed to decide and were wowed with all of the food we tried. The cheese bread were warm, doughy balls of comfort, crispy outside and melty inside, and served with a delicious paprika butter, and the lobster and chorizo consisted of a generous mound of fresh and flavourful mayo-laced cold salad on a crispy pork skin, just delicious! The potato pave with truffle emulsion were a crispy delight, and an obvious labour of of love to stack and fry the dozens of layers of potato so perfectly; the perfect bite when dragged through the rich, creamy dip, but our favourite snack was the angus beef short rib bao, with pickled cucumber and chimichurri, a deliciously divine combination of textures and flavours. My friend enjoyed her main course of red snapper with curry emulsion, and my asian style beef short ribs were meltingly tender and beautifully cooked, complimented perfectly with the sweet sauce and creamy barley porridge. Desserts were small but packed a sweet punch, and my apple millefeuille with smoked calvados ice cream was the perfect end to a stunning meal.

The service was also fantastic. The hostess who checked us in and seated us was friendly and welcoming, and the gentleman who served us was attentive and warm, with a great sense of humour and a lot of personality, able to make recommendations and engage in conversation with us, adding to our enjoyment of the evening.

This is a 'spot' I will undoubtedly be returning to again. And they are offering takeaway at the moment too, so would be worth an order for sure!"
5* kitchen and service,"1st class service, nice fusion food with innovative extras. Highly qualified staff. Looks like working there is fun!"
Great opportunity to drink top quality wine with excellent food,"Eaten in this restaurant on numerous occasions and never disappoints. Great opportunity to buy a good bottle of wine from 1855 and then take it into the restaurant without being charged corkage (hence no restaurant premium). Furthermore food and service is excellent. Highly recommend the Wagyu grill, Local duck breast and the grilled Hamachi"
Weekend lunch with sister,Came with my sister to celebrate her bday. Fantastic food and ambiance. Service is attentive. Will definitely be back for more :)
Good food and nice ambience,Good food and nice ambience. Look out for super attentive staff Justin and Dwayne! Will definitely be back.
What a great lunch!,"Usually I would not expect too much from set lunches, or from fusion. But this really hit the mark. The red snapper in green curry emulsion was absolutely delicious, as was the fjord trout. The blend of east and west fit perfectly. Well done."
Great lady's night and good service,"We had a great one at the Spot, the Lady's night has a good deal and the service was super nice: Justin took super well care of us and we will definitely come back! Thanks for this good evening!"
Nice food & great service,The food served are nice & my favourite is the beef short ribs. Great service & thanks Lyncy for the warm welcome! Will be back again.
Birthday Celebration,The 5 course menu is so worth it! Raj assisted us and is very helpful. Great food and customer service!
Very good service,We had a very good birthday celebration for my wife amd had the 5-course menu. Raj was very helpful and attended to us very efficiently. Well worth the price. Food was superb and expertly cooked!
Splendid Birthday celebration,"Booked a table for eight to celebrate my wife's birthday. Ambience of the place was nice and not too noisy. Had a bottle of their house pour, Craggy Range Savignon Blanc and it was perfect. If you are into meat, must try their Wagyu petite tender beef and Kurobuta pork back, it's grilled just right and it's delicious. We ordered seconds. In fact, almost every dish we ordered was perfect, we had char grill octopus, foie gras de conard, roast NZ baby lamb chop and even the fried cauliflower was done in a special way that we have never tried before. As for dessert, must try their creme brulee. Overall it was an enjoyable evening for everybody and the service staff was excellent. Would hope to visit again sometime soon."
Good lunch with the family :),"The set lunch was good value for money and the food quality was great :) Loved the ambience too! We were served by Justin and he was very friendly and attentive throughout, overall we had a good experience and would definitely like to return to The Spot."
"Great ambience & food presentation/quality, albeit with arrogant servers (except for one)","I was the first diner to arrive at the restaurant. The server who showed me to the table kinda roll her eyes at me for arriving a few minutes earlier before the start of their shift at 1130hr. I am sorry but is this the way to welcome someone?

When my friend arrived, as it was our first visit, we needed more time to go through the menu. However the servers took turn to come and take our orders, which demostrated some attentiveness, however it created some pressure on us as well. The server who showed me to the table, did not make any eye contact when we communicated with her, which I felt wasn't very personalised.

A very petite and sweet server saved the day with a warm smile, while helping us to decide by recommending her favorite dishes. Thankfully she was also the one who attended to us for most of our time there.

As my expectations were quite low at the start, it gradually got better as we were served our appetizers, mains and desserts. I love the presentation of the dishes. The free flow mocktail is a good deal for non-alcohol drinkers like myself. Only $8++ what a steal!

Overall, I enjoyed the lunch. If the servers attitude can improve, it will be even better. If the management is reading this post, hopefully they can provide some customer service lessons for them.

I will recommend this place to my colleagues, friends and family!"
Great night with friends for drinks,Food was ok but drinks was fantastic because you can buy the wine from 1855 shop and drink at the restaurant. Sylvester was an amazing person and very friendly!
Disgusting service worst we have had in 3 years of living in Asia,"Service was poor , waiters were rude we strongly recommend to avoid this place. We have never been served bottle of sparkling water with no glasses and had to request glasses which took 15 minutes to arrive. Ordering drinks became a mission. I was asked to repeat my order 6 time to various staff and even then it they came out with the wrong drink. How hard is it to order a vodka and tonic!!
Was spoken to very rudely by a waiter. staff did not appear to have a clear view of what they should be doing.
With so many choices around the area this restaurant needs to “up there game”!!"
Perfect for celebrating a special occasion,"Came here to have dinner on my birthday with my fiance. The interior is quite romantic and casual, not too crowded, we were surprised by the level of service and quality of food!

We enjoyed the burpple 5 course tasting menu alot and were left super full at the end of it. My favourite dish has to be the truffle steak. Cooked to medium rare and the truffle flavours complemented the beef perfectly.

Plus the waiter was really sweet to have noticed that I was holding a bouquet, made it a point to find out what the occasion is, and then gifted us a slice of birthday cake :D"
Fantastic Set Lunch,Visited this restaurant based on a recommendation and was thoroughly impressed by the quality of food served. I had the 3 course set lunch and it was slightly pricey but the food quality was excellent. I started off with the Beef Tartare followed by the Sea Bass and ended the meal on a sweet note of the sea coconut creme brulee. I also had the free flow mocktail which was a first for me. The food was delicious and service provided by Raj was superb. Overall would recommend.
Superb Food and Service,Was really impressed with the food!! Service was impeccable!! Very reasonable price and will visit again for sure!
Impeccable service and delicious food,The Spot has always been one of my favourite restaurants to visit. Awesome service and the food is always delicious. Puts a smile on everyone’s face. A great place to celebrate a loved one’s birthday.
Don't be deceived into thinking you are getting bar food.,"Surprisingly the food was great. I expected bar food as the place looks more like a bar than restaurant. The welcome bread balls were delicious. The kingfish starter was good and my dining companion enjoyed the octopus. The barramundi was prepared well with a crispy skin but the broth was poured on top at the table which defeated the crispy skin. I would have preferred to pour the broth, myself. The menu did not mention any ham in this dish but I found ths out perchance whilst speaking to the waiter. Something as crucial as this needs to be mentioned on the menu.This was excluded from my dish.My partner loved her red duck curry and it was great that the rice was served as a side dish. The pannacotta was excellent. The sour plum on top made for a well balanced and delicious dessert. My partner loved her ""snickers"" bar but perhaps a kniife is a better option than a spoon. All in all a delicious meal. Will definitely visit again."
Birthday dinner,"Had a great dinner using Burpple, The five course dinner. the fish was really fresh and sweet, the steak was tender and flavourful! The cheese bread was also great to kickstart the dinner, if only it can be bigger.
They also remembered that we were celebrating both our birthday and gave us complimentary cake :)
Our server lyncy was also really attentive and always filled our water. She was also nice to share the lunch sets available which were really great value!

Will come back again! :)"
Amazing experience,"Great afternoon at the Spot, nice modern Asian influenced Menu, excellent wine and incredible service. Jannah provided us with an amazing recomendation of red snapper and apple dessert. Not our first time here and I am sure not the last one :)"
Wife’s Birthday Treat,"So, I work nearby and dined at Spot before. Always a pleasure to be here. And decided to bring my wife for a lunchtime birthday date. As expected, food was great and service exceptional (waitress attended to us was named Jannah).
Two thumbs up. Definitely recommended."
Wonderful AGAIN!,Our waiter Wen Jun was very helpful and added to our dining experience at Spot. We will be coming back again to sample Lee Boon Seng's wonderful cuisine
Great lunch Had nice lunch,Great lunch Had nice lunch with work team Great food at reasonable price Chardonnay was lovely Highly recommended
excellent meal and service,good array of appetisers and mains in the menu and excellent service. Thanks to Lyncy for a fantastic time
Good food and service,"We visited for an early dinner with the kids (1 and 3 years old).
Very good service and yummy food. We had the char siew and mozzarella sticks as appetizers and sea bass in green curry sauce and bomba rice with tiger prawns for mains. Everything was delicious.
Also the cocktails were nice.
Very child friendly servers too which was great, given that this is not their usual clientele."
First Biz Lunch of the year,"Had lunch with my boss at Spot to start the year. Our server Raj, made the experience an absolute delight. Helpful, attentive and super polite! Will def come again."
Never disappointed with their special set menus!,"I've been to The Spot 5 times now, I believe. Always for their special set menus such as X'mas or Restaurant Week menus, and always find the food to be really interesting and delicious and great value for money. Celebrated NYE here as well, and the food, amazing as always! Great service by our waiter Raj as well.

I've never been to The Spot for their regular a la carte though, as I find the menu items to be less interesting than what they offer on their special set menus, so hopefully, they will find a way to incorporate some of their more exciting dishes into their regular menus."
"Good vibes, great service","Unplanned night out for drinks and snacks. Decided on The Spot and was a great choice. Good food, and most importantly, great service from Dwyn! Good recommendation for food and drinks."
NICE ENVIRONMENT TO RELAX AND DINNER,"The environment is good, the waiters also nice and polite to serve us. The cuisines also very nice.We will visit again."
Brilliant,"Fantastic new year dinner. Loved it. Great service. Our server, Faraq Khan was really sweet. Recommended."
"Please , improve the service","Went here for Christmas Eve dinner 2020 with 2 kids (7 & 6 years old)

Nice decoration, cozy , clean restaurant, not at busy area which is i really recommended

But unfortunately the service was very bad . Need 1hr to serve truffle fries

There’s no explanation when server came to serve the food, (set menu) and need more than 60 mins from appetiser to main course.

More than 3x called the server to fill up water and we need to pouring wine by ourselves.

Overall good .. food delicious !!!!"
Good food good service,Was here for restaurant week. Portion was sufficient. Fusion food was good. Coffee tasted great. Service was good too.
Great Spot,The service was very attentive. The menu items were fresh and very creative. Like the fusion of Eastern and Western cuisine.
Just great,"Really creative menu, well-executed dishes, good service, good wine, reasonably priced. Will be back! Tip: buy a bottle at the adjoining 1855 Bottle Shop and drink it at the restaurant without corkage."
Hidden Gen at One Marina,Pleasantly surprised to discover this hidden gem. Great food and service. The short beef rib Bao was simply awesome. Try the lamb shoulder croquettes. Could not decide on the desserts but the chocolate tart was awesome.
Restaurant week,"Saw the advertisement for restaurant week. We decided to try. When reached restaurant, the server suggested us to try everything. We think it’s a good idea. The fish was not my favourite. The rest are good. Happy hour $10 for white and red wine."
Give this a try for good fusion food,"Had a good lunch with excellent service. We started with the cheese bread balls, which were quite nice, if a tad heavy and dense. The lime kingfish was tasty and done cerviche style in Thai coconut curry, while the charred octopus was delicious. We both had mains of duck with rice. The duck was nicely grilled, and slightly pink in the middle, but the thick cuts made some of the pieces rather chewy. The rice was also a little gummy.

Dessert was snickers eclair and panna cotta, both of which were good.

Parking was free, which was helpful."
"Cosy atmosphere, pretty good food selection & wines","Was there for ladies' night ($29++ free flow wine that comes with 3 free oysters; additional at $2 each) on a Wednesday. Selection of wine- prosecco, white chardonnay & red merlot- was decent for the price paid. The food selection complemented the wines well, ranging from sharing platters, bar bites to mains & desserts. Although it is not cheap, it was affordable for the portion.
Vanessa, the captain was also prompt in her email reply when I had queries about my reservation. The staff including the bartender, WJ, was friendly too. Nice place to chill out with good company, without being too intrusive or noisy."
Service Issues,"Went for a business lunch. Surprisingly poor service, staff was totally not interested in us - absent when they were needed and pushy when they needed to give space. Perhaps they have new staff because I have been there before and this wasn’t the case earlier."
Great place to chill with,"Great place to chill with friends , nice selection of wines. Bit pricy but justified for the location"
Feedback,The service was slow but restaurant not busy. When the food came it was cold or Luke warm. Every item came seperately even though there was two of us one of us waited 10 minutes until other meal came and vegetables a good 15 mins after. Wouldn’t eat there again.
Nice lunch venue that hits the Spot!,"Love the vibe from the get-go from the handsome bar, to the natural light streaming in and the generous dining space. Love the vibe from the get-go from the handsome bar, to the natural light streaming in and the generous dining space. Icing on the cake? Set lunch menu was reasonable and worth trying.

Ala carte pricing was reasonable considering that this was residing in the latest kid on the block within new downtown Marina Bay Financial District.

My partner had a refillable mocktail at $8, which wasn't just syrupy slushy drink. It was pretty tasty - Chamo Tea.

My barramundi fish in anchovy kombu broth was very yummy with its ultra crispy skin to boot."
Lovely Ambient with Contemporary Cuisine,Love everything about this place! The vibes are good & the foods are excellent. Enjoyed the lunch set of SG Restaurant Week! Service was courteous & speedy too! Will be back again!
One of the best restaurant I have visited.,"I went there with 4 friends and family members for our Sunday lunch. We had a wonderful experience. The ambience is cozy and comfortable and set us in a very relax mood. The food is value for money and is Super delicious. The bonus of our dining experience that afternoon was the superb service given to us by the staff, Iza and Dwayne and not forgetting Kelvin who is very friendly.

My wife is so impressed with this place that she has already made up her mind to celebrate her birthday here in Oct.

We will be back!!!! And if there is a 6 Star, I will gladly give this place a 6 star rating."
"Lovely Evening, Everything was on The Spot!","As we're discussing where to spend a special evening, we're recommended this place and glad we listened!

We're led to our table and I can only imagine the number of people who would have eating here. The place looks magnificent. As for the food, the servings were enough for 2, barely finished what we ordered.

Of course, all of these are not possible without the awesome staff who where so attentive to what we need yet gave us space so we could enjoy our dinner in private."
A special place for us,"I proposed to my fiancee at the spot, she had registered us for a Macallan food pairing event in November 2019, and to surprise her, I secretly called the staff to liaise, they were very accommodating to all my requests. The place has great ambience, nice to chill and relax, with live band, the chef is extremely creative with his food pairing, I recall having pan seared foiegras with ice cream and lobster with Tom yum sauce.

We went back for a 7-course Valentine’s Day menu in 2020 and the food was creative and tasty again. The dumping foiegras, dark malt charsiew wagyu and Spanish mackerel, along with the starters were so good and memorable.

The service staff are excellent, friendly and responsive as well."
Anniversary & V day dinner,Excellent service and great food! I enjoyed the dinner very much. This is the restaurant I will strongly recommend my friends to visit.
"Prices a little steep, but good food! Will be back!","The visit got off a little bumpy. Being located in the heart of several office buildings, the restaurant & bar was bustling with office workers TGIF-ing. As a result, all the service staff were busy and no one was at the counter receiving diners. We had to wait quite a while to get seated despite having a reservation. At this point, we were already lowering our expectations.

Thankfully, the service picked up after that. We were served by a friendly and enthusiastic waiter throughout the entire dinner (a rare phenomenon for a casual dining place considering some Michelin restaurants don’t do that as well) despite how busy the place was. He constantly checked on us to make sure the food as alright and even gave us tips on their Mon-Wed promotions on their drinks which honestly sounds quite attractive! Will be back to check them out together with their cocktails which also looked good.

For the budget-conscious, visiting on the days with promotions or for a weekday lunch if you work in the area (they don’t open on weekends) might be a good option as they offer set courses at much more affordable prices with your choice of appetizers, mains and desserts. You could also order as ala carte. Options for the set courses are pretty good as well, unlike some restaurants which have little variety for lunch sets.

Otherwise if you’re willing to splurge a little (the prices are a little steep), Most of the dishes impressed us with its flavors and unlikely blend of Asian and western styles, with exception of a couple that could be tweaked a little. The cheese bread was a little too salty on the outside and could be fluffier inside. The saltiness pretty much overwhelmed any taste of the accompanying butter. Interesting crust though. The bao slider tasted good but thought that the sauce overwhelmed the beef and foie gras terrine that was in it, which was a pity considering the potential of this dish. Iberico char siu was to die for with its caramelized glaze and tenderness. Snapper with green curry emulsion was also delicious. Also don’t miss the unique desserts!

There were more on the menu we would have liked to try but alas there were only two of us. But I guess this calls for a return visit!"
Amazing meal,"Went to celebrate my birthday & Xmas with my friend and tried out their Xmas menu, it was amazing!! When the first appetiser was served, it was king fish tartare, I don’t eat raw fish but I decided to try it anyway, but couldn’t take more than 2 mouths (it’s just my problem) my friend absolutely loved it and finished the entire plate. Realising that I barely touched the food, the restaurant manager - Sedfrey asked me about it and kindly change it to a grilled octopus (which is AMAZING) for me. The rest of the appetisers and main course were just perfect, and the chocolate tart was so great too!!! I can’t wait to bring more friends to try the food @ the spot :)

Thank you Sedfrey and team, everyone was so friendly and they explained the food with so much enthusiasm! Really made it a very pleasant dining experience."
Great Dining experience with family at the Spot,The King Fish appetizer was excellent and the main course Snapper Fillet in Green Curry Emulsion too was a firm favourite with crispy skin and moist firm flesh that soaked up all the flavours of the green curry!
So-so,Chose The Spot for a small birthday lunch from the good reviews. It was a nice venue but I didn’t feel it warranted the rave reviews it have received. The house wine was not as advertised and not very good. They were out of the short rib - despite our table being booked for 12:30 and the octopus starter (with surcharge) was very rubbery. Not cooked long enough. Had to ask the waiter to reduce the volume of piped music twice as we couldn’t even have a conversation at our table. Service was attentive and friendly. Food was reasonable but under seasoned. I was surprised by the size of the bill considering we were three people having only two courses and one glass of happy hour wine - but I guess that’s what it’s like in Singapore now
Ladies Night is awesome,"Went consecutively for two weeks with different groups of friends. Cheery and attentive staff, good vibes! Great work post-work hang outs."
The Spot at 1 Marina,Excellent service and delicious food!! This is my 2nd visit this month. The preparation of food is consistent and the ambience is just right for business lunch. Have been recommending The Spots to my colleagues and friends. The Angus beef dish is a must try!
Impromptu family lunch,"Hidden jewel, not so crowded, excellent set lunch menu, highly recommend the kingfish, beef tartare and baby squid starters. For mains, the red snapper is to die for. The duck breast is also very good. Staff are super friendly and nice and service great. Highly recommend, value for money!!"
Excellent Service and Food,Order anything on the menu and it will not go wrong. Highly recommended: Baby Squids or Octopus for the starter. Red Snapper or Pork Cheek for the main. Trio Rice or Sea coconut Creme Brulee for the dessert!
Chef's Dinner 2.0,"It was an interesting night for me and my better half. Both of us enjoyed the food prepared by Ms Petrina Loh and Mr Lee Boon Seng. It was delicious and a good mix of special ingredients, culinary skills and matching cocktails.

We loved the starters of burrata as well as razor clam in mango curry. The main course of barramundi and pigeon was fantastic and it ended well with the desserts of rock melon Assam granita and variations of cempedak.

The waiter and waitress were also very attentive and service is good.

Thank you for a wonderful evening."
Team Get Together,Feedback from the guests who attend the dinner on 16 May. The food is quite good but service is rather poor.
Amazing food and service!,"We went for mother’s day celebration. The array of food that was presented to us was fantastic! Each dish is made of high quality ingredients, and we can feel there is so much thought in putting the dish together in terms of flavor combination, and towards a better health. For example, we had the wagyu beef carpaccio which had bursts of olive oil caviar, and lentil sprouts. The quality would be very similar to what we get in a 1 Michelin star restaurant or even better! The service was warm, friendly, and is attentive to our needs. Thank you and we will come back for sure :)"
Oh Wow,"A friend recommended this place. I was thinking what a dodgy name and was not prepared to be impressed. But I was really happy with the place especially the service. The staff were friendly and professional, surpassing even some Michelin star places. A great place to hang out in CBD."
Dinner,"Food is awesome. Wine is great. Ambience n service are both attentive to the details. As the name suggest, you just need to at spot to experience it on the spot yourself!"
DEFINITELY A GREAT SPOT !!!,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!
New SPOT to chill, wine & dine and its truly IMPRESSIVE !! THE SPOT @ Marina One is a Medley of European & SEA cuisines, interesting concept that combines restaurant, spacious outdoor Terrace great for Happy Hour, Exclusive Cigar Bar, 1855 The Bottle Shop & Macallan Boutique all rolled into one. Beautiful chic decor especially the stunning Bar in the middle, MORE than GREAT service especially by JAJA, food is SO GOOD and so well presented, thumbs up to young Exec Chef Lee Boon Seng & team Thanks to Young Boss CR Lim and Exec Chef Selamat Susanto of Fat Chap for recommending me to this GREAT SPOT !!

Business lunches,"Friendly staff. Nice lunch set menu. Really enjoying the couscous salad, the beef tartare and the red snapper."
Everything awesome,"Went there during lunch earlier and had their lunch set $39+++ ( 1 appetizer, 1 main and 1 dessert).

The staffs there were very friendly and prompt, food was good as well. Love the environment, not too noisy for a good conversation.

Will be back again to try their dinner menu."
