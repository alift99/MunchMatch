"A great variety and spacious, comfortable seating arrangements","This place gets better each time we visit. Our 3rd trip to SIN in 6 months.
The food outlets are very clean, quick and love the authentic flavours they each bring.

Recommend the oyster and egg, carrot and egg, freshly smoked satay sticks with yummy peanut. sauce

The seating is comfortable and tables are large and spacious"
Weird changes…,"Food, drinks and service are great! But after renovation the cooling breeze from the sea is blocked by a hedge and it is terribly hot. The smoking area for this huge capacity of this Hawker is a ridiculous place of 2x2 m far outside the center. Real diversity is different, for sure."
Thai stall near ATM is terrible,Doesn't taste like Thai food at all. Unit is close to ATM area. Not authentic as the cook doesn't seem to be Thai.
Good food at decent price,"Located on the East Coast , a hawker Center in reality. Good local food at decent prices. It’s open air and there’s no aircon. As it’s by the beach , one hopes for a nice Breeze to go along with the food .

If dietary is not a restriction , try the pigs trotters prepare with ginger and vinegar and the ‘spare parts’ . Goes well with rice ! They open around noon . The sugar cane water stalls goes well with the food and the heat . Alternatively , the satay is good too and they open for business slightly later.

Overall , wide selection . Decent prices . Car Park is not quite an issue . Nice location by the beach . Worth to go . But do note - it’s soon to be closed for renovation. Do check it out before heading there ."
Good hawker center for satay,"Good hawker center with awesome satay and sugarcane juice! If you are in ECP, try satay at Rahim Ayam Penyet Satay Istemewa! Highly recommend. Delicious. Also try the sugarcane juice in the nearby stall. It's huge portion as well."
The food is amazing and delicious.,The food is amazing and delicious. The satay is amazing and the coconut juice is very fresh. Perfect spot to hang out
Big hawker centre by the beach,"There is a good variety of stores there to enjoy/try local hawker dishes.
Some of the local favorites that you must have there will be satay, sambal stringray, cockles and clams, fried oyster egg, grilled chicken wings and grilled crabs. Enjoy them with a coconut or beer. While the place is not air-conditioned, it is not that hot there because of the sea breeze.
The stores there mostly only accept cash so do bring enough. There are also ATM machines available.
Before you leave, remember to look out for the elderly couple who sell roasted chestnuts by the entrance. It is very yummy!"
Best place to have satay,"It was the best place to have satay in Singapore. The view was straight to the beach so it was very nice to chill there. You can order from different counters with different kind of food and their special dish - satay. I ordered scallops, beef satay and coconut water. Everything was so fresh and tasted really good. Sauce was very good and I thought spicy sauce fit satay so well. Coconut water was not sweet but it tasted fresh. It felt really like summer!"
Nice Location,"We caught a taxi here one evening for dinner but weren't off to a great start when the taxi driver had no idea what we meant. He took us to East Coast Park Apartments! While Singapore is an english speaking country there are many Singaporeans who do not speak good english so be aware when you are visiting! I was looking forward to eating here but have to say was a little disappointed. It was very busy but it was a public holiday, I imagine it does get busy at other times though as its a lovely spot by the coast for families to enjoy. You may have to share a table & once you have that there are many food choices amongst the many hawkers. We were hoping for cheaper chilli crab (cheaper than restaraunt prices anyway) but alas it was still pricey for hawker food. That said we did enjoy the food we ordered & the tiger beer always goes down well! BTW you will need cash here. Also its a bit tricky to get a cab when leaving, we asked a local & he ordered us a Grab (similar to uber), cost was S$12. Nice spot down by the water to watch all the planes coming in!"
Came back a couple times,We were staying in the East Coast and so this place was sort of local. But soooooo good and soooo cheap - so we decided to come back again for more. First - look for a table and then go choose your food! That’s the system. It’s cash only but ATM is also available in the area. Lovely atmosphere!
Delectable Food.,"An open food court besides the bay, it's a very popular place for Singaporean-Malaysian food. Satay is the main fare but there are seafood, vegetables, purely Singaporean dishes. Sitting is under the open sky or under canopies around tables. There are many stalls selling halal as well as non-halal food. Food was delicious, varied and served fast and sure. Hygiene may be a bit wanting, prices reasonable.
There are arrangements for cycling, skating, boarding. One can see the planes landing into Changi airport."
Expensive and nothing special,"As a Singaporean hawker centre / food centre, the food variety is not bad, but the food is pretty expensive. The place gets warm when crowded and the tables can get quite dirty because many customers still don't know how to eat cleanly or clear their own tables after eating, and the cleaning staff is often not fast enough to clear the tables. If you sit too near the satay stalls, you leave the place smelling like satay even if you don't eat it. If you have no choice, this is the cheapest place to eat at, at ECP. If you have a choice, there are cheaper places to eat at. If you're near to Parkway Parade, the food at the food court there is about the same price, but you eat at air-conditioned comfort."
Store 44 - Good satay!!!,"Tried the satay at this store 44, both chicken and pork, really well done, sauce is good too! They also sell oyster omelette and carrot cake."
Seafood BBQ at East Coast Lagoon Food Centre,"I would like to recommend our locals n foreigners who r visiting Singapore to visit this store, Stingray, store no. 43. They have been selling for at least 25yrs.... The quality n the standard of every dish is fresh n delicious as before! they have different ways of cooking and sometimes they also carry seasonal seafood..... Come try and experience yourself!"
Best Place for Satay and Seafood!,The food at East Coast Lagoon Village is pretty much value for me. I would always visit Adimann Seafood & Satay Specialist for its savoury satay and bbq stingray. Find a table near the beach so that you can also enjoy the sea views while eating your meals!
Lunch,Duck rice Q happened to passby n saw this Q for lunch not bad actually quite strong nice food and watermelon juice in this hot weather
Dinner,"I love having dinner with family at East coast. Food was amazing and delicious. So many varieties etc the best satay , chili crab , gong gong , big cereal prawns and all types of fish. It is cheap and portion is reasonable. The best part is eating near seaside and it is windy. Chill and cosy great place to hang out."
More pricey but nice atmosphere,"Pros
+More selection than a lot of hawkers
+Lovely location by the ocean, nice sea air
+Plenty of toilets

Cons
+Harder to get to than more central hawkers
+More pricey than most hawkers
+The only real game changing con to this place are the intrusive sales touters trying to get you to buy food. I would prefer they let me make my own decision. I wanted to view all the food on offer before making a decision and they were pretty much all trying to rush me.
+Might be a bit touristy for some

Conclusion
========
Despite the cons I'd love to visit again, so cannot fault the marks for this place I enjoyed the food and location too much."
Foodie By The Beach,"A good place to enjoy lots of variety of nice local food. Suitable for both locals and overseas travellers.Price is reasonable generally.

Recommend to attire in light and thin sporty clothing. Surroundings can quite crowded and the air quality can make you feel sweaty when you can't enjoy enough Seabreeze at certain times.

Other than that, the place and facilties were well equipped and maintained. TOILETS are clean."
good food amazing service but pricey,Place has amazing food where you can vibe with your friends with over lunch/dinner. Perfect for any occasion! had my camp over there and the food they provide really delivers! mostly open at dinner time
Satay so Yummy,"They have an excellent Lamb satay, fried oyster and BBQ stingray which is all delicious. I love it and reasonable price"
Introducing a friend to local food,This was the first time in Singapore for my friend and so we chose here to give him this gastronomic baptism. Great selection to choose from with all the classics.
Yummtastic,"Should really bring your friends and eat here, which is by the shores! Really windy and relaxing to take a break here"
Local hawker culture,"This is a hawker centre in Singapore, renovated and one of the better looking one in Singapore. The all-in-one stop to enjoy the local hawker culture with all the street food on offer like the fried oysters, hokkien mee, satay, bbq stingray, just to name a few.

A must-visit for first time travelers to Singapore."
"Cold coconuts, hot satay, and spicy crab","I love this place, the stingray, the chili crab, the variety of satay and the lagoon. You go out to the beach and see the waves as you chew on some amazing lamb skewers, you watch the sand castles and the people fighting for a place to sit. The real Singapore can be tasted not in orchard but in the hawker centers."
"Great hawker food; lots of choice, inexpensive food and beer. Great satay.","Located by the beach this hawker has views out to sea, it is all outdoors but the table are covered. There are dozens of stalls offering all kinds of foods; the more popular ones have long queues, (I think the longest was at 'Song Kee Fried Oyster'). The popular satay stall avoids having long queues by taking your order and giving you a pager to come back for the food when it is ready. The wait wasn't long and both the chicken and beef satay were delicious."
a great selection of hawker fare at reasonable prices,"we often go there if we want a nearby selection of good affordable hawker food. firm favourites are the oyster omelette, various satays, bbq stingray"
Cheap and good!!,"Favorites there are the oyster omelette, satay and chicken wing! Must order when you visit. I like to get the tables facing the sea when I’m there as well."
Sweat in goodness tasty food,"Boyfriend only request is to visit same stall at our little beach food centre for seafood meal. Crab, stingray, veg, clam soup with chinese wine. All at sgd$75. Better taste than restaurant but you must accept the facts that there is no aircon. Presentation of food is as good. Oooh.... the clam soup is heaven."
Haron Satay,We been ordering chicken satay from Haron Satay for a few times. Always long wait. But lately the standard has dropped. The chicken satay were dry and tough. Hard to chew. More like meat jerky. Some of the chicken were only half the portion.
Truly worth the trip,"This was a complete revelation and truly wonderful. Slightly Venice Beach in that you can bikes, skates etc to enjoy this fabulous coast and jetty. The view of the three hundred or so ships anchored just off shore is spectacular as is the walk along the jetty. If you are a plane spotter this is just under the main landing path and there is a landing nearly every minute. To top it all there are nearly 120 hawker stalls in this centre with the most extraordinary food. We could hardly walk out the place we had eaten so much. We have been coming to Singapore for 20 years and had no idea this existed. This is truly an amazing place."
Hawker food with many choices,Great eating place to enjoy Singapore food near the seaside. Many choices as there is many stall opened but only at evening time. Few stall in the afternoon. Anyway you can try cheap food and beer here.
Lots of food stalls! The halal stall we frequented was not that fantastic!,"Went there over the weekends with friends! Lots of stall you can choose from! We ordered our food from a halal store, the food was only acceptable but not fantastic! The place is quite crowded over the weekends! The Satay was not bad! $0.70 per stick! Competition is tough among the various stalls! You can choose from any stalls! Btw the view is fantastic! That’s the best Prize for eating at this place!"
Hawker Food,"The place was quite crowded, but once a table was gotten, we could dig into relatively cheap beer and good food.

Our dishes were Black Pepper Crab, Chili Crab, Fried Rice, Sweet & Sour Chicken, and Satay Chicken Skewers(plenty of them).

The food was pretty darned good and the skewers were absolutely brilliant. While the black pepper crab appealed more than the chili Crab.

Overall a good place to visit for good food with friends."
OK lunch but few stalls open,"Went here on a Thursday lunchtime, following lengthy walk through park. Very few stalls were open and the place seemed deserted. I found a stall selling Nasi Goreng vegetarian, which seemed OK. Accompanied by a Tiger beer from another stall, this was good enough."
Sea food galore,"The place is crowded. Found a table inside. The selection of menu was quick. Will help if the stall owners can speak a bit of English. Ordered chilli crab, prawns, stingray fish, greens, fried rice & bun. Food was a bit sweet. No napkin/tissue given with food. Had to buy it from an old lady selling it.
The place could be more cleaner. It was sad by Singapore standards."
Amazing Food,"One of the best Hawker Centre that I have been too in Singapore. Amazing food selection and friendly, accomodating vendors. Had a small sized BBQ stingray, kangkung belacan and rice for $20! Amazing."
An Oldie But Goodie,This hawker centre has been in the area for more than 30 years now. I have always loved it for its proximity to the beach. You will find all the various local Singapore delicacies here. The must-try is the satay. Hiring bicycles is easy as well. You will be able to ride all the way to Marina Bay Sands.
Amazing food with reasonable prices,The food here is quite reasonably priced and the quality is beyond our expectations. It’s a must try absolutely. Will be back soon.
Lovely and hygienic food,"The food village is located adjacent to the east coast lagoon. Make the best out of the trip here by going a little early in the evening and enjoying at the beach, which is impeccably clean and dotted with ships. Then have great and decently priced grub at the food village. Go for local delicacies. Be sure to drop your trays in the bins before you leave. And then take an after dinner walk on the beautiful and clean east coast parkway right upto the jetty and back."
Busy out of town food stalls,We were recommended to go to this food centre by friends and it was a longish taxi ride from Orchard road. Lots of good food to be had here. It was very busy and buzzy but it was a Saturday night we went there. Only drawback was the 1 hour wait for chicken satay so we didn't bother with that this time. The food we did have was very good and very cheap too. Another drawback was the long wait and josttling for a taxi home. Apart from that it was good food.
Great evening,"We went with friends and loved the evening here. Luckily we went early and we managed to secure a table. The satay we ate was the best I’ve ever tasted. The food overall we ate was well prepared and tasty, the prices are good and it didn’t feel very touristy, which was nice. If you fancy an authentic night market this is a good place to go. Also very clean, no dogs allowed, which I like."
Try once and you are addicted,"My friends bring me to this food village every time I'm in Singapore. To be honest, there's really no fun in going to Singapore and not trying out the food here. Though this place offers a variety of food, I just love their seafood. This time we tried fried sting ray. It was my first and I devoured it in one go. It was that delicious! It was fried to perfection and was smeared with spicy syrup all over. We also had squids, coconut prawns, clam noodle soup and green veggies. By the time I was done, I couldn't move...so I downed it all with a giant size portion of sugarcane juice!"
Best food with affordable cost,"As a singaporean, one of the best thing is that we can get good foods even at late night. If you are in singapore, do come down to East Coast Park Lagoon Food Village. Do try the BBQ Chicken wings at Ahmad Spring Stall and you will never regret it.!"
Outstanding for what it is,This is a very casual laid back outdoor hawker stand partially covered next to the beach and a large lagoon. It's a great place to spend the day with kids.
Cheap nice food available here!!,"It’s a must visit to this place! Seafood spread is the best here. There’s satay too available.. cheap beers! And desserts, all under one roof!"
Wide variety of local food,We liked the wide variety of local food at this place. The food tasted good. Only issue was that the place is not full rain proof.
Halal & non-alcoholic options,"Sunday family dinner, less $70 spent on food and beverages for family of 4. Cool breeze, nice pleasant setting. Place to bond. Went to bedok jetty then after, rented the quad bike $60/hr. Well spent. Plenty of laughters and memories."
Nice tasty end to a long ride,"Really nice weekend activity if you have friends or kids to entertain. Start on the bridge and get a few bikes.. ride all the way to this food court and try the satay and coconut water.

They have a lot of seafood, a few mainland places but no Indian if that’s your thing. The satay was probably the highlight though"
"Value-for-money, delicious food after a day at the beach","Many restaurants in East Coast Park are quite pricey, like Jumbo Seafood etc. Here, you will get tasty hawker fare at a great price. The stingray here is amazing, and so are the satays - some of the juiciest, tenderest I have tasted in Singapore hawker centres. Drink stall owners are really friendly and efficient and will offer/bring you drinks from where you are seated."
Cheap local food,"If you are in Singapore and feel like eating hawker food by the beach, this is the place! There are variety of food here! You can try their Satay, seafood, black pepper crab while enjoying your fresh coconut."
Great hawker food options!,"East Coast Lagoon Food Village is a long way to go if you don’t have a car, but it’s totally worth it! We had a really great long lunch there. Highlights were:
1. Char Kway Teow from stall 46 Choon Hiang, super tasty noodles;
2. BBQ Chicken Wing from Ah Hwee ( I think it’s stall 44), super juicy yet crunchy; and
3. Beef and Chicken satay from stall 55 Haron Satay, seriously good charred bbq satay sticks."
Fantastic,"Very busy vibrant hawker centre, great variety to choose from and very good prices. Highly recommend the chilly crab and satay."
not many good stalls left,"This used to house many good food. But I think the fad has died and the good hawkers have either passed away or moved on to another location, time and space.

Only 2 good stalls left... duck rice and fried oyster.
I don't tell you their stall numbers so that the crowds to these two stalls can still be managed cos the queues can get terribly long.
In fact, I was trying to get duck rice yesterday evening at 6pm.... but when I arrived, the queue had already formed and a stall runner was taking last orders.
Incredible how people plan their business... so sell out during dinner time. It's as good as missing out on likely possible profits.
But oh well, there are many other food choices there, albeit with no queue and standards not as great as the duck and oyster.

Chicken wings are good, but then it is not a staple meal. Perhaps to pair with beer.
Satay bee hoon was legendary, but the original cook is now dead.
The beef kway teow is no longer dishing out quality standards like before.

So really, what reason do you have to visit this food village?
None. Absolutely none."
A great place for family time!,Relaxing and fun park for both children and adults. Nice strolling around and chilling out with beloved ones. Various options for food and drinks at a good price! We love the sea food here and enjoy spending weekend with our family and friends here.
Good food at good prices,"This place provides a good cross section of street foods available in Singapore. Can be very busy, we were there on a Saturday night and it was crowded. Food was good with good variety. We have been here before and would happily go again."
Great food... Great choice,This place was recommended by a taxi driver and didn't disappoint. The area itself is a great area to walk around and check out the East coast... Food was fantastic... fresh and well cooked and a great price. Ready access by taxi.
Just landed with empty tummy,"Street food here, taste good, plenty of choices, well organized. Next to the beach, felt good mood and satisfied."
Haron Satay,"The East Coast Lagoon Food village is a good way to sample local Singaporean fare all in one go. We came here on a recommendation from a friend. We headed directly for Haron Satay booth. I don’t recall the location within the place. But you can walk around first to find it. I ended up with a 10-piece chicken satay from Haron, which was quite good, along with some rice from an adjacent booth. Tiger beer from a separate booth. We came on a Saturday night, and finding an open table was no easy task. I recommend going here as a group. One person can secure the table while others run for food and answer the buzzers when your food order is ready. Also beware its cash only. There are ATM’s on the premises. Stop by the East Coast Lagoon! You can take a walk along the beach afterwards."
Seafood and other local foods in affordable prices,"Having stayed in SG for 20+ years, here's a little insider tip - this is a paradise for local food at a local price! Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab, Carrot cake, Satay, Buttered Prawns, Prawn paste chicken, Fried Rice.... you name it, they have it! Prices are more affordable than other seafood places frequented by tourists. We come here frequently for family meals and bring our visiting friends here. Be patient when waiting for seats as it may be packed during dinner on weekends and holidays; walk around as it's quite a big area."
Another Hawker Market,"Great, like many of them actually are. Lots of choices, and undercover as well. Unfortunately a bit out of the way though."
Good way to get the local flavor,Someone at the hotel I was staying at recommended this to get a feeling for where the locals eat and she was exactly right. This place was affordable with friendly service.
"Best ""duck rice"" and ""sting ray"" on east coast",Came here for several years already and honestly not all the shops are so great but they are few they really make the difference. my favourite are the DUCK RICE stand 29 if I dont get wrong... as u enter just on your left hand side second shop and the sting ray shop on the right side. Very delicious and everlasting taste. would love to rate the place individually but seems is not registered or possible but so 4* are my general feedback.
My Fave place for awesome Satay and Rojak,"Succulent satay and crunchy rojak..where you ask..East Coast Lagoon Food Village of course..With rows of stalls selling says, you will be spoilt for choice..For me, my choice is clear..It's gotta be Haron's Satay..The meat is grilled just right, peanut sauce not too oily but very crunchy..The Chinese rojak is yummy as well..With only two stalls, you can try both and decide for yourself..Of course being a food village there are lots of seafood and other dishes on offer..So do yourself a favour, give the place a go..You won't regret it.."
Great atmosphere outside,"A good place for seafood and satay. Try the stingray in spicy sauce. BBQ beef, Fried rice top. Good choice of drinks too. Nice place to spend an evening with friends."
A great place for dinner and a beer.,"Plenty of choice here with plenty of locals lining up for their favourite dishes. The satay sticks were sensational! It is a great location and after dinner you can go for a stroll along the parklands there. You need to pick a table and remember the number and then go to any stall, order the food or beers and they will deliver it to you table. It can get crowded on a Friday night but we had no problem getting a table. A great choice to try some genuine local food,"
Best food centre on the east coast,"Easy accessable, ample parking, tremendous choice of food, seafood, chicken rice, sateh, its all there and very reasonable priced, cleaning of tables when they become available is fast and good, very popular seven days a week, but specially on the Singapore Family day; Sunday.
Popuar with locals, as easy to reach via two ECP underpasses and by town folks as well.
Highly recommended by a frequent visitor."
Perfect Place for Dinner,"This Foodcourt is one of my top list to have dinner with friends & families. It's not so easy to get there by public transport and only one bus line operating from Aljunied or Bedok MRT system.You can have black pepper crab which is my favorite ever and prefer than chili crab version,BBQ chicken wing,Teo Chew style steam fish,BBQ stingray or prawn,Rojak,oyster omelette,Sambal kangkong,La La or Chuk Chuk, Ohh mouthwatering isn't it ?"
Satay Galore along Eastern coastline,"I must confess that I’m a fan-club of Satay and every time I have the chance to visit Singapore, satay will be my sought out food. So the only place serving the best satay apart from the Lau Pa Sat, would be Haron Satay at the East Coast Lagoon Food Village.

Haron Satay stall no.55, is located adjacent to the main entrance of the food village and the whole stretch of hawkers in that end area sells satay only, however, Haron’s stall would be the one that stands out as there will be a long queue making their orders.

What so special of Haron’s satay? The satay is grilled to perfection and the meat is fresh, tender and juicy. Haron Satay’s are generally skewed generously with meat fillers mainly beef, chicken or mutton. I personally fancy the beef, crispy on the outside, tender in the inside and it’s not too oily. It taste mildly sweet but not burned. Grilled to perfection.

Each satay stick costs around S$0.60 each with minimum orders of 10. All satay platter is served with homemade peanut gravy, ketupat(steamed glutinous rice), slices of cucumbers and onions. “Yummy and mind blowing food tasting.”

Apart from satay, Haron’s stall also offers BBQ chicken wings. Moderate taste but practical for side orders. For drinks, Haron’s next door sells sugarcane juice. Great combination if it’s served icy cold while you tuck in your satays’.

And of course there are a variety of food around the food village if your food exploration doesn’t end at Haron’s.

To get there, there is public bus such as bus line 401 traveling along East Coast, and drop off at bus stop B93151 and another 5 minutes short walk. Or else for convenience, get a Grab or Uber service. Expect a big crowd over the weekend evenings as getting a seat can be a daunting experience."
great food and great value,We just had an excellent evening at the village. There are probably 100 hawker stalls to choose from. a real authentic place.
Super Sedap Satay at East Coast lagoon,When with friends to East Coast Lagoon Food Village.We order 10pc Chicken & 10pc mutton.Self collect waiting time about 25min.Chicken was BBQ just juicy and tasty .Mutton was a little disappointed out of 10pc .....4 pc was full of Vein .....Attached photo.
Good place to eat,"I am a visitor from Malaysia and this is the first time that we are eating at the East Coast Lagoon Food Village.

It's well set-up with very attentive food vendors. You can find all sort of food variety there. Not necessary the tastiest, but they are not that bad. Some of the items are highly prizes - an example is a buttered prawn is S$8 per prawn...that's just way too expensive.

It's next to the beach. So, you can buy food and head to the beach to eat. There's a good walking path to walk around.

Lot of locals eat here. So, that shows that it's a good place to eat.

Taxi is not easy to find...it's juts that you might have to wait a bit longer than usual.

It's a good experience & I would come here again for a meal."
Fab food,"I visited the food village with some friends who live nearby- they often eat there and after my whistle stop visit to Singapore you can see why!
It's a buzz with delicious smells, friendly Hawkers, colourful atmosphere and excellent food (so much to choose from!!!)
Pick a table and off you go around the dozens of Hawkers choosing delicious fresh cooked food! So quick is the service you end up with a table loaded with food!
Adimann Seafood and Satay Specialist was my favourite
Highly recommend this cultural eating village - a real taste of Singapore!
Love Satay love Singapore
Eat drink and enjoy!!
TrevC"
A great experience,"A good food outlet. So many places offering all Asian dishes You just pick a table, pick what you fancy and it's brought to your table Same with drink Cheap and authentic dishes A good night out"
perfect place for seafood,"great place for seafood and ambience is fantastic. too bad that the place is always busy in evening but good thing is that there is a growing space and churn is not that bad either for u to get a seat in an hour max. (yes, an hour sometimes but hey, u can relax next to beach)."
Everything under one Roof,"If you want to try 'local food', this is the place to come to. You can get almost all the different types of food, Chinese, Indian and Malay and the prices are reasonable.
Beer is also available and the beach is just a minutes walk away.
It gets crowded on the weekends and sometimes getting a seat may be difficult.
Its definitely worth the trip if you're in Singapore"
"AH HWEE BBQ CHICKEN WINGS, AWSOME","we had seen this gentelman making the charcaol chicken wings in tv, and made it a mission to find him.
we did, the chicken wings are to die from they are just awesome, had to get more, so glad we found it, keep it up SIR, thank you :) :)"
Yummy Local Food and Place,"An Enjoyable place to eat for our favourite local dish and seafood by the sea side. An open space and sheltered area with the aroma of barbequed Stingray! This place was ever since my childhood with my family. It brings so much joy and happy reunion here! Whether is in a day or night, never failed to come here all over again to crave their most popular Meaty Satays, Otahs, Barbequed Stingray, Sambal Cockles, Fresh Coconut juice, Fresh Sugar Cane and much more! For non locals, should try this place! For locals, I know you guys would come here over and over again"
Choon Hiang hokkien mee,Very good hokkien prawn mee. Not too soggy and taste just right. With a tasty noodles with windy beach what's more can you ask for?
If you visit Singapore it's a must,I live a 10 minute walk from this place and come 3 to 4 nights a week. The place is amazing friendly with an enormous selection of local dishes at very reasonable prices. My tip come early and get a table beach side where you catch the breeze. Enjoy
Food. Food and more Food,We went to the East Coast Lagoon Village on the last night is Singapore and wished we had found it earlier. It mainly seafood but the variety and choice is good. Satay is also available. We went for a walk on the nearby jetty to lose the added kilo's
Worth the effort to get here,"This is the place where many locals Go to eat good food. The whole area is filled with many small food courts and they got a little bit of everything. Try the Chicken Sate, supergood, really worth the effort to get here. It is located 10-15 min with Uber from CBD. Very Cheap!"
Great Satay and Seafood,"Super relaxing place to be.. A lot of seafood, from Halal to non Halal, Pack with Tourist, A lot of Seating area,. Best place to seat was the one with shelter area in the middle of the hawker. with fans. Its best to get seats with fans on top of u as the place sells a lot of spicy Asian and seafood. Superb food. I had satays , lots of them, their gravy is nice and the chicken , beef satay, superb tasty and soft. we also had cockles with sambal and even fried rice and few more dishes. prices are not bad. but beware of places where really mark up price. Its a good place to have a family gathering."
Good Solid Hawker Center; Not the Best Though,"We were staying fairly nearby in Katong and hopped a cab ($10 at rush hour) and got here in about 15 minutes. Our goal was satay and we found a good Chinese stall. (My wife prefers pork satay, so we couldn't go to Malay stalls, and they far outnumber Chinese satay stalls.) The pork was cooked perfectly. The sauce was good, but our favorite satay at Chomp Chomp has a pineapple flavor that was missing here. It was good, and the pineapple would have made it great.

At a different stall, we got chicken wings and they were very good. At still another stall, we got an oyster omelet. The omelet was done quite well, without being overly oily.

Everything was very good. I wouldn't rate any of the stalls as being best in Singapore, but all were good. On top of the food, the view of the ships anchored just off the coast makes this an enjoyable place for a post-sunset meal."
Best satay,"Quite often visit the East Coast lagoon food village by bike as it is within the East Coast park. Also accessible by road there is a big car park next to it.

The location is peaceful, the front of the village is almost on the beach and you can see the sea through the trees. There are lots of shady seats and there are even some outdoor pavilions there that have seats and ceiling fans to cool you down.

The satay is a good option here. Lots of different stalls to pick from, all good and in my opinion as good if not better than satay by the Bay.

There are good juice and beer shops here for refreshment. We have also tried other things like Kang king with sambal, BBQ seafood like stingray and cockles, Oyster omelette etc.

The place has a good local crowd and gets really busy at night. Would recommend checking this place out if you are visiting Singapore. Good fun, hawker dining by the sea."
Fun place where it is difficult to choose what to eat,"An outdoor food court of sort where one can pick and choose what’s tempting to the palate: fresh fruit juices, satay, grilled shrimps, and many other delicacies mirroring the multiple ethnicities populating the island. The dishes are freshly prepared and beautifully seasoned. The favoured booths have long line-ups."
This is a MUST hawker,Abundance of food to experience and a nice setting. Try to get a table nearby the water. We go there almost once a week.
Never disappoints,"Eaten here probably ten times. Done lunch, dinner, alone, with friends, proper visits and biking right in. This is the best hawker centre I have seen. The variety is immense, from satay to sambal stingray (a favourite). The setting is pleasant, covered in case of rain. You get a beach nearby and Singapore Wake Park, if you feel energetic afterwards. Finding a table may take time in the evening, but it is a price worth paying."
Wonderful Hawker Centre,"We have visited a couple times before, but recently went for lunch for the first time. There are less stalls open and the atmosphere is less vibrant, but the experience is still excellent. There is a large variety of local foods and drinks, and superb value for money. Try everything as it is all good! Very popular with locals which indicates high quality of food."
A good variety of food by the seaside.,"A good variety of food is found there just by the seaside. Easily accessible by car or taxi. However, the place can be quite crowded on weekends."
Great local dishea,Visited this place for dinner on a Sunday. The fried oysters was really good! From $4-$10 per plate and thus great value for money. It's right beside the BBQ chicken wings stall but be prepared to queue for a long time.
Best connection lunch ever!,"Me and one of my colleague had lunch at this place while killing 6 hours flight connection. This is nothing short from an adventure. We tried the famous pepper crab, deep fried spicy fish and bans with chilli sauce. While that was one of the messiest lunch I ever had, it was also one of the testier I had. The crab was cook perfectly and the fish was full of flavours. The chilli sauce is a start dish. All in all, expensive but worth the experience."
Local Colour,"Down by the waters edge and we were the only European people there amongst hundreds of locals but there was a great atmosphere. Numerous food outlets to choose from with all styles of Singaporean food, order what you want, find a table and let them know the table number and it will delivered to you in minutes. Compared to the Newton Circus Hawker Centre this venue was not as efficient in clearing or cleaning the tables, however it was very busy."
Great hawker food,Best sate at Oleh Oleh and great seafood at Ocean Muslim Seafood. Great friendly service. Fast and efficient. Not expensive. The sate is fresh with great peanut sauce.
"Eating Out at East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Singapore","A hard-to-beat delightful experience to be able to eat almost under the clear blue sky, open spaces, with the cool sea breeze all around and the seaside just next to the eating areas. There's unbelievable choices of the local, hawker foods and the most popular orders are the fresh seafoods of squid, lobsters, stingray fish, being barbecued or deep-fried to delicious crunchiness ! Another really good eat, will be an order of satay of beef, chicken or mutton...satay is the local version of marinated, barbecued meats on sticks, which comes with the side of spicy peanut sauce, to die for. The local yellow noodles of mee rebus (malay style noodles topped with flavourful bean sauce), mee-siam (vermicelli cooked malay style with a nutty cococut gravy), mee-goreng (yellow noodles stir-fried with pieces of shrimps, fish cakes & beansprouts) are just a few eats favourited by the local Muslims. Not to be missed is the local and all-time favourite salad of Rojak. A favourite non-halal dish will be the excellent black and white fried carrot cake, roasted chicken rice, or dry mee-pok (flat yellow noodles served with mixed sauces,slices of fish cake, and fish balls). I wish to mention a favourite soothing sugar cane drink which can be ordered with lots of ice-cubes or without. The freshly squeezed sugar cane without ice-cubes cost $2.50 per tall glass, and of course there's also all the cokes, pepsis and beers that one can have there. The never-ending choices of local, hawker foods, much cheaper that restaurants and taste just as good, or even better. A lovely place to chill-out with family and friends. There's a large car-park and there is also eating spaces which has covered roofs and decent size tables and benches. No fear if there's a sudden thundery rain shower. The best time to visit this fun eating place is probably during the weekdays towards the evenings. It gets rather crowded during long weekends, public holidays and evenings on Fridays and Saturdays. Nevertheless, it is THE place to be when you absolutely need to eat local, see local or laugh local....see you there ! Just one more mention.....this is NOT as restaurant but a local, outdoor eating place with a large number of mix of stalls offering a variety of choices of local foods."
Great Food in a Lovely Setting,We had dinner this evening (Thursday). What a great place! We arrived about 6pm and went for a lovely long walk up to Bedok Jetty and beyond. Then we were lucky to find a table with a sea view - which meant we had a nice cool breeze. I think this gets very busy later on in the evening and at the weekends. Perfect. Cold beer. Absolutely delicious BBQ stingray and fried squid at 01-43 Stingray Forever BBQ Seafood. Beautifully presented and really nice service. Recommended. We had the best satay we've had in the month we've been here in Singapore (and we've had a lot of satay!) at stall 55 Haron Satay. We then had some excellent fried black and white carrot cake which we'd never eaten before from a stall very close to No 43- Stall 40 Lagoon Carrot Cake. This is a really enjoyable evening out in good weather. We took a taxi there and back. I think there are buses that take you quite close by.
great beach hangout!,"Tons of choices to choose from, there's always something for someone. What's best is the location, right on the beach, just adds to the fun outdoor eating experience."
Eat like a Local!,"I was brought here by locals, and I can see why! So many stalls with real local food. Anyone wanting to check out local food, or hawker stalls, this is your place! So many foods to eat!"
Must try corner of ECP if you are looking for the best seafoods,"The seafoods at Seasides BBQ Seafood ( Stall no 3&4) is the best seafood that I have tried in Singapore. And its have a very wide variety of seafoods and other foods to choose from with reasonable prices. Besides BBQ Seafoods, you can also try many other different types of food there. Thumbs Ups ."
This is a must try corner of ECP for the foodies,"Let's face it, if you are a street food lover, you can't miss east coast lagoon food village. This is essentially a food court, covering huge area near the area F of ECP. Plenty of food variety, from Satay and chicken wings to staples such as chicken rice and mee goreng . We usually order Satay as starters and end with sea food fried rice. And yes, suger cane juice is must have. Prices are quite reasonable and comparable to the food court elsewhere"
