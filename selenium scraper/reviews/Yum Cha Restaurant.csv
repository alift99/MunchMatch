Rude slow but good dim sum,"Yum Cha, Chinatown: Rude auntie waitresses. Check. Dirty toilet. Check. Slow service. Check. Welcome to your typical old school dim sum eatery. It’s been more than 15 years since I’ve been here and it hasn’t changed much. Sometimes nostalgia makes up for the lack of service with charm. We even had a dead pigeon outside the window. Dim sum buffet spread is decent - in fact, the prawn hargao’s are the biggest I have seen. The dim sum are generally succulent, generous and good tasting. #eatstylishtravelstylish"
Dim Sum As You Hope It To Be,I don’t think you could pick anything on the menu that wasn’t superb. From the soup dumplings to the squid dim sum. We didn’t try the fried carrot cake but that sold out as we were there for lunch. Small queue to get a table on a Saturday.
New Favorite Chinese Restaurant,"I had gone to this restaurant with some colleagues before, and them being Chinese, I had let them do the ordering. This time around, I was in Chinatown with my wife and 2 year old and we decided to try our luck.
The dim sum that we ordered was outstanding. The pork bao was more delicious than any bao that I have found in Singapore. The rice noodles with seafood was divine. The eggplant stew had just the perfect spiciness to it.
A truly outstanding restaurant and our new favorite when it comes to Chinese food."
"Food worst , services worst , not advised","First time come to a eating place that food is not fresh and worst food and customer service also is a bad and not trained before , spoiled our country Singapore , as always said is a proud of service in Singapore , but here food and service is worst I have go"
Great service provided by Aunty Siew Lan,"Queue was cleared fast on Saturday. Went for Dim Sum, good was good and pricing considered a bit high side at this location and ambience. Service is excellent with Aunty Siew LAN’s hospitality service and her passion on her job, She anticipated her customer’s needs and very attentive . She is really a valued asset to your organisation. Thumb up to Aunty Siew Lan . Well done!"
The food and service of Yum Cha restaurant in Chinatown outlet,"I went to Chinatown outlet with my gf. The food was average but not so bad. Thumbs up for aunty Siew Lan, she is friendly and providing great service to us, taking care of us.. unfortunately, your staff “Wang Yue” is the worst server I ever seen.. no patient at all, when I asked her to check for our order, she gave us a bad expression and the body language is like she don’t get paid for her job!! I seen her did the same to another table guest too.."
Authentic Cantonese cuisine,Love this place! I’m Cantonese and the taste of the dim sum here is authentic and yummy. Staffs are friendly and diligent. Price is a bit high but once a while is fine.
Local favourite,"Always like to come here with friends & group for the Dim Sum buffet on lunch , service & food always in a good side. Hope reopen 5 pax soon."
Service with a scowl,"If the food were not better than average, I would have scored this below 3.

The food is good and consistent. But I go there because of the Auntie is is always nice to me and always nice.

In general, the rest of the staff is blah.

This past week was particularly poor and I will stay away for awhile before I return for my Auntie.

A dish was undelivered 45-50 minutes after ordering. When I notified a manager, she rummaged thru a takeaway bag (packed by her subordinates) rather than take to assure me that she would look into the order. Mind you that I have been going there weekly for about 2 months.

If service is no issue for you and you are adept at getting what you need, this is a great place.

If service is a concern, then avoid this place like the plague.

It will be soy time before I go to see my Auntie again. :("
Scary experience,"0 out of 5
I was denied entry to the resturant after they checked my Tracetogether app, saying that they are not accepting people with such data and I was forced to leave.

Despite angry, hungry, paid for carpark and wasted time queuing, we move out of the place without making a fuss to look for food as that wasn’t a mall.

They insisted that there wasn’t a procedure in place but does not seems interested in finding out my situation after several emails corresponded.

I still waiting for their reply after ten days from the last email… (I wish I could MIA like that in my work too.)

Their customer care and recovery is poor. Long way to go.

As a dim sum lover myself, there plenty of good restaurants worth the time, food and good assurance of customer service frontline and back. Yum Cha Restaurant is def not. I have not try before will not try.

This poor experience make me only value those business who value their customers.

That said, I will NOT go to Yum Cha Restaurant and risk again."
Msg in food,"5 of us visited the Chinatown restaurant. We had the hi tea buffet at 3pm. Not allowed to even sit at the table until exactly 3pm. Food was nice. We enjoyed the food very much. After that we made our way home. We realised that we were very thirsty though we had tea at the restaurant. Realized that the food has a lot of msg. Though we drank a lot of water after that, it took a while for us to feel better"
Bad service,Very bad service and attitude. Very typical of singapore restaurants that's doing well. Food wise so so. Oh yes and no one picks up the phone when we tried to book Will I come back? Of course NOT
Average dim sum,"Had a catch up with friends at yum Cha restaurant. Didn’t know it was so popular during weekday and had to Wait 1hr plus in queue to get in. Restaurant out look was typical, nothing special to comment on. Ordered ala carte dim sum instead of buffet style. Dim sum taste was average though the expectation was higher. In general, everything was average. Nothing spectacular."
We called to reserve a table,"We called to reserve a table but was brushed off by staff “no need reservation, just come”. The impression was there are tables available.
When we arrived, we saw a full house, I wished the staff could have been more informative for us to make that decision to go or not go.
When we arrived, we saw some customers showing their reservation and we enquire why the double standards.
The experience was “we were begging for dim sum” and was ordered to wait in line.
No kind words... customer experience is not only just food but the overall ambience as well...
Never ever come back..."
Delicious and fresh dim sum,I am not a dim sum connoisseur by any means but everything I tasted here was delicious and I loved the fried noodles with mixed seafood. These types of places are always better with good company - enables you to order a wider selection and take your time to savor the different tastes and textures whilst chatting and sipping on some delicious teas. Would definitely want to return soon - it was super busy even for a Friday lunchtime so recommend booking ahead.
Cantonese Dim-Sum - a total experience,"For the uninitiated, Yum Cha (meaning: drink tea) has evolved from that of a leisurely natter over piping hot Chinese tea and handmade snacks to that of an international cuisine.

So it is more than just tucking in food served in front of you. It is about revelling in the company of loved ones or friends in an atmosphere of civility and camaraderie. Hence the decor, ambiance and service of a dim-sum place is as important. Sight and sound sets the mood. The food prolongs the revelry.

Of course, Yum Cha Singapore has got all that and more. Gone are the noisy patrons of the 50s. Now youngsters sits next to octogenarians and ladies of leisure.

I am 69 years old, Cantonese and well-schooled in the difference between eat to live and live to eat. I find Yum Cha's dim-sum almost perfect. By marrying Restaurant settings with Chinese tea-house (originator of yum cha tradition) delicacies, this is one place you won't want to miss.

Sure, Singaopore's Chinatown may have become a mere commercial caricature, but this is one exception."
Good Place With Authentic Dim Sum,"Fresh Food were well cooked and delicious with prompt service during visit with my administrative assistant, ex-Treasurer and financial advisor on 30 September 2020 7.00 p.m."
Great food and atmosphere,"Went with the family just before 3pm when their buffet offer starts.
Service was fast. Food was great.
Have been a few times now.
It is based in Chinatown in an old building a level about the street (1st floor for Brits, 2nd floor for US/Singapore ) and the decor makes one think this is what it must have looked like years ago.

They've stopped serving the peanuts which they then charged you for on the bill but do still charge for the hand wipes unless you say you didn't use them.

Will return."
Great Dim Sum,"Went here for a larger group gathering and had a great time. We all shared a table full of Dim Sum and drinks. Overall found it to be great value, all of the food fantastic while the menu was extensive trying many new things. The service was also very good with a great atmosphere."
best place for dim sum,We were recommended this place on a previous visit to Singapore and took the time to find it again. I am pleased to say it lived up to our recollection – excellent choice of freshly prepared dishes served as they are ready (don’t be alarmed when they arrive separately) – service is brisk and efficient. You may refuse the dish of peanuts that arrive when you sit down – they are a chargeable item.
Pure deliciousness!,"My wife and I visited Yum Cha with our Hello SIngapore guide during a night tour of Singapore. When we weren't too enthused about eating from the street vendors, he brainstormed and proposed Yum Cha after we asked for dim sum. Not sure what ""cha"" means, but it was totally ""yum."" The place was hopping but accommodated us immediately. There were all types, from businessmen to small tour groups. The dim sum was served in baskets of threes, which worked out perfectly for the 3 of us. Item 0111 was our hands-down favorite!! it was like a delicious cloud of warm yuminess!!! We were a bit concerned about the variety since we don't eat pork, but there were plenty of options for us. During our stay, we ate at some fine places, but this would be the place we most look forward to visiting next time."
Buyer beware,"We were recommended Yum Cha restaurant by our hotel. We are definitely not fussy eaters but we have experienced better tasting items practically anywhere else - nothing special.

We had been stung somewhere else with being charged for peanuts so we remembered to decline.

We would have been okay with the overall experience but when we were asked if we wanted Won Ton soup, I checked multiple times as we don't really like seafood. We ended up with the Won Ton soup with mini abalone at SGD$12.80 per person! I'm kicking myself as we should have sent it back but we had tasted it without knowing. It's hard to know what you're getting as it had one large dumpling in a small bowl so we didn't see the mini abalone on the bottom. We didn't eat any more after this! Just have the server point it out on your a la carte sheet first before ordering and you wont make the mistake we did!"
Solid Dim Sum in Chinatown,"Protip:
- Location: The restaurant is located on the second floor. The first floor only has a red door and a small sign.
- Solid Dim Sum Restaurant that passed the test.
- Recommend the Steam BBQ pork buns and Fried Sweet Potatoes with Scallop.

Yum Cha is a decent dim sum restaurant that you would visit if you were craving it and nearby. The ambience is a little on the upscale side but with reasonable prices.

If you do decide to visit, the location can be a bit tricky. It's located on the second floor with only a door and small sign on the first floor (Sandwiched between two gift shops, You can look through my photos for the sign. The restaurant itself is pretty huge for SG standards and able to accommodate multiple huge parties.

When you sit down, you're given a menu to order your dim sum items. There aren't any food carts they push around. However, the service was slow, so you should expect to wait and extended period of time to receive your food. (Average 30 mins, minus a star there).

The food itself i must admit was delicious. I ordered the following:
- Steamed BBQ pork (Recommend)
- Crystal Chieves dumpling
- Fried Sweet Potatoes w/scallop (Recommend)
- Xiao Long Bao
- Rice Porridge w/Century egg
- Lotus leaf Rice

Keep in mind the portions are smaller than your typical Dim sum restaurant. So if you're starving, you should order one extra one.

Lastly, they tend to nickel and dime you with the tea and for the wet napkins.

Overall, I would visit again."
Hidden gem,A meal here was part of a cruise excursion. You'd be hard pressed to find the entrance amongst the rabbit warrens of Singapore's China town. Must be popular as there was a fair queue to get in. Service was very quick and the food was served hot and all was tasty. No complaints from our group of 20.
Great foods,"Had a gathering with friends here. Wide varieties of foods mainly snacks (dim sum) to choose from. Good foods provided. To get the best out of the foods, it is best consumed while it is hot. We even ordered a prosperity toss.
Will definitely come again."
Good but could be better,"Tried after much feedback from friends on the place. Overall the food was good and staff was quite attentive.
Lookout for their crab meat egg white fried rice...

The only thing was their lift and escalator was not working. Had to carry stroller up and down the stairs. Cant imagine if elders come for their meal had to do the same thing.

Overall a must come back"
Real Chinese off tourist´s food,"admittedly, it is hard to find in the hearth of Singapor´s Chinatown: you have to walk up one storey and the way is not really inviting - it is dirty to be straight. BUT, inside it is like ion an old-time Chinese busy place, with waitresses that have aged with the restaurant and that will help you with the right choices aminos the many delicacies. I just love all these different dumplings and fish and appetizers - and all come in small portions - so best is to come with a group and share.

Highly recommended"
worst peking duck ever,"we ordered pork steamed buns - good taste and sufficient filling, shrimp mango dumplings - good for what they are, and half a peking duck, which was the worst we have ever had (and we have enjoyed peking duck all over the world). little flavor in skin, wrapped in wonton wrappers not pancakes, and the duck itself was tasteless and tough. what was worse, the staff seemed to have no appreciation that when your guests don't eat an item that they should ask what the problem is and perhaps made an adjusted to the bill. we should have returned the various Hawkers"
Family dinner,I visited this restaurant today.It was recommended by my hotel.My daughter and myself have a shellfish allergy and are nervous eating in restaurants when we don’t speak the language.A lady called Susan helped us pick some dishes that were suitable.She was so helpful and the food was delicious. I would recommend this restaurant and hopefully will go again.
Clearly a locals go to place! Food was excellent!!,We really enjoyed our visit & brunch here! Tasty foods! It’s hectic and busy but a lot of fun! Lots of foods for all tastes!!
Dim sum so-so!,"Recommended by a friend as a good place for dim sum but I find the food average & ambience poor. It was noisy & the air carried a strange musky stench. Thought the char siew pau tasted like factory-made ones that could be found at most coffee shops. The vegetarian noodles seemed pretty oily & lacking in taste. Dim sum were so-so. However, the saving grace was the scallop congee which was smooth & nice."
"Efficient, good, authentic food",Was busy lunchtime in Chinatown but we waited less than 5 minutes were seated at a good sized table for the 5 of us and we were served quickly and it was yum! Can highly recommend the olive fried rice - sounds unusual but it was delicious.
Average for dim sum,"We came here due to the reviews and was easy to find.

Sadly the reviews were correct in that they will try and give free looking condiments like peanuts and napkins but actually they will and charge you even if you didn’t eat or use them.

In my books deceit is wrong and they should be upfront about it. Offer it if asked.

The food in general was average. Their signature dish of fried fish skin was not bad but most things were fried including the carrot cake! Very filling and not that great either.

I would find somewhere else if your looking for good dim sum.

Sadly the old adage applies here, you get what you pay for."
Mango Pudding,"We had dinner at the Yum Cha Restaurant guided by Mrs. Magi (Tour East Company). I requested a vegetarian set menu. The rest of the group had chicken and seafood. My set menu consisted of a corn soup, eggplant side dish, vegetable rice & broccoli. My dessert was the smooth mango pudding with mango chunks. The soup was ok, the eggplant was tasty, the rice was ok too, broccoli was simple and the pudding was perfect, it was cool and not too sugary. The place was packed with diners.

SEE photos."
Expensive standards,"Quality of dumplings was average to good (so 3-4 stars of 5). Be careful with „extras“ like tea, which is normally free, costs 1.8$ per person, also the towels and 20 peanuts."
Excellent Dim Sum in Chinatown,"We found this restaurant after a recommendation by the barman in our hotel. We took his advice and were not disappointed.
Booked online. Can't book for couples online apparently or 3 people - the online booking system only allows you to select from 4 persons upwards. When we were in the restaurant there were tables with less people so is probably a quirk of the online drop down field.
The Dim Sum was excellent.
Don't worry if the person serving you does not speak too much English. The menu is very clear and you can write on the form on the clipboard how many you want of each item.
Each dish was served piping hot and we soon polished everything off. Very tasty. Would recommend. Have since spoken with other friends who had also been here previously and they have all had good experiences with the food here.
Would definitely go back again if we find ourselves back in Singapore.
Its a very short walk from the Pagoda St exit from MRT Chinatown station. We used google maps to guide us but it really isn't far.
There is a lift from floor level or you can use the stairs.
Saw previous comments on loos but they seemed ok and were definitely better than somewhere we went in Hong Kong the previous week."
"Good, but.....","Revisited after a two year absence. This is the third time we have lunched here , only because we were told of a good Yum Cha restaurant but not its name, so we found ourselves back once more. I have previously reviewed this restaurant and we had decided to not return owing to the dreadful condition of the lavatories. ( This time a little better). On this occasion we were tired and hungry and decided to give it another try as the food had been good. Once more we were not disappointed with food quality. Service ranged from polite and helpful to stony silence. Another reviewer has commented that you will be charged for the peanuts on your table, whether or not you eat them. We did not see if the peanuts had been left by previous diners or refreshed or completely replaced so it is better to ask them to be removed. Who knows where the fingers of previous diners have been? You will also be charged for the face wipes provided instead of napkins. A small charge in the overall price, which is not cheap, but, in Australian terms, a RIP OFF!"
Good Food,We recently visited Yum Cha as part of a group tour package which included dinner on a visit to Chinatown and various sites around Singapore. We were really surprised by the quality and selection of the food we were provided here. The sweet and sour fish was great! Only negative was that we felt a bit rushed to eat everything served.
Stay away...good food and service but...,"Beware! They will even charge you for napkins and peanuts, the dim sum was good and overall food is good but beware you will get charged for the tea the peanuts and towels that you never ordered, food is already a bit expensive and you still need to pay for stuff you don't normally have to pay for and is already served on the table, I was charged SG$ 4.00 for just a handful of peanuts that were on the table before we sat down, also wet napkins..."
Expensive,"I was held back by their price tags & ordered only a few dishes to try. I think their food can be easily found elsewhere at a cheaper price. You just have to know where to look. This eatery makes money off tourists. Just one look & you know.

Their silver dish was good but a tad too oily for my liking."
Yum Cha Chinatown,"Worse Worse Worse. Wait Wait Wait. We asked one of the push cart auntie and she reply us, 'That is not my sector. (Xiao LongBao) I can't check for you'.You have to wait more LONGER loh!'Then she keeps on selling the speciality signature food in her push cart..
Even the food you have ordered are infront of us and they don't even look at the ordered on the table. We have to call her back to ask her to look at our order receipt which placed on the table.
There is nobody around to top up hot water for our chrysanthemum tea, 4persons charged at $8.80 for the small pot of tea (equivalent to only 6small cup).
When made payment at the counter also must wait.. The cashier takes her own sweet time to arrange all the credit card receipt inorder.
We will never return to this restaurant again."
Lunchtime feast,"This was the first time that we went to this yum cha restaurant. We had a nice and enjoyable lunch. We didn't have a reservation however they made room for us.
The food was good however not a massive amount of options on the trolleys, we ended up ordering from the menu.
Service wasn't as consistent as I would have liked in removing empty plates and drinks.
Staff were friendly."
Satisfactory,We went to this restaurant on our first night in Singapore as we were recommended it but it was disappointing. We thought we were going to have a proper yum cha all inclusive price but we didn’t. The food we ate was a lot of battery dough type food and weren’t sure of many other dishes. There wasn’t a great selection to choose from. Ate T far better places while we stayed in China town. Not expensive.
Not the best options,"I‘d not come back here again, there are better options around. Taste wasn’t impressive, big parts of the menu weren’t available, service was there ... but not really into serving with passion.
DinTaiFung is way more impressive than this place."
Yum Cha Lunch,"We were 4 couples who arrived without a booking but they were able to sit us within 2 minutes. Peanuts and wipes were provided on the table, which we found out when paying the bill are charged for (peanuts S$2). Ladies bring carts around with the various baskets of dumplings etc and the dishes ordered are recorded under the relevant price section on the paper sheet located on the table. We had chicken feet, crispy fish skins, prawn dumplings and a few other dishes that I have forgotten the names of. All the food tasted very good. The service was efficient and the ladies would explain all about each dish they showed you. Would come back if visiting Singapore."
"Yeeha, Best Yum Cha","We had a lovely meal in Chinatown for dinner and decided to go back and find some yumcha (Dim Sum) for lunch.....and this place cam up in our search.

We were not disapppointed. If pressed for time, I would suggest booking,as we had a 20-30 wait....but it was worht it.

Everything was good. xiao long bao was outstanding and everythign else was pretty dam good....if you like yum cha, go here!!"
"I had a feast, everything was so yummy!","Amazing dim sum, I had to visit my first day in Singapore as in my town in Spain, there are no restaurants that serve dim sum so when I landed, I headed for an amazing dinner there. I tried a few dishes and everything was mouthwatering. It wasnt expensive either bearing in mind that Singapore is not a cheap place.
I would recommend you visiting this restaurant and having a feast!"
Delicious food,Most of the dishes were delicious with very few exceptions. It is not too expensive. Definitely worth visiting again!
Good and tasty dim sum,"Brought my father in law here for lunch to celebrate Father’s Day and the restaurant was packed. Not easy to get a parking lot to begin with. Waited about 25 min for a table.

We were lucky as we were allocated a table right at the corner of the restaurant. As a result, it was less noisy as we found the main dining area pretty chaotic and noisy for our liking.

The dim sum was great and tasty. As expected with the restaurant full house, service was compromised as we waited nearly 30 min for your char siew bao to arrived. The rest of the dishes were pretty fast. I love their char siew baos, the pork ribs, har gow, too many of them! The restaurant is still maintaining the traditional push carts style which we thought it was pretty nostalgic.

Not cheap but I thought it was pretty good."
Lovely dimsum with traditional carts,"When was the last time you saw dimsum carts being pushed around? What a reminder of the old days. No computer menus for ordering with a pencil here, back to the ladies pushing carts and showing you their baskets of dumplings. And the food was very good too.

We arrived without a reservation on a Sunday morning and got in. Noisy, tasty, traditional. Great."
Yummy!,"Service here was fantastic!
Especially love the older waitress who came and chatted with our three year old son trying to make him comfortable and entertaining him
Food was great with a great range of dishes to choose from. We got all our favorite yumcha dishes plus more we'd never seen before.
It does get very hot and humid inside despite the restaurant's portable air-conditioners and fans, so come dressed in light weight comfy clothes."
"A true authentic Chinese restaurant, I highly recommend a visit to this restaurant!","First, I’d like to say if you are looking for authentic Chinese food that locals frequent this is your go to and you won’t be disappointed. You may need to search a little to find it but it’s worth the effort in my opinion. The staff was friendly the food was great and we were very happy with everything. We were charged $2.00 for peanuts that were already on the table when we arrived that we never ate and 30 cents each for wet wipes (no napkins), I don’t really agree with this practice and only found out about it after we returned to our hotel. I personally don’t find it to be a huge deal but I would think if you mention it to the staff they would work with you on this if it’s a problem. I would definitely return and I recommend giving it a try if you are looking for a local restaurant for true authentic Dim Sum."
Lovely Lunch In Chinatown,"Deliciousness served hot and well presented. Use the lift get to this restaurant upstairs if needed as stairs steep. Lift is accessable from the side entrance. Ask for table in the airconditioning area unless you are happy to overheat. Don't use the the wipes unless you want to be charged also the bowl of peanuts have a charge.We turned the peanuts down and they were taken away but once home found them on our bill $2. Tea is served almost right away but again is charged at $5.40 for three people. Make sure you remind the for your drinks order. We had to wait a good while but restaurant was busy at 12.30 mid day.
Enjoyed our dishes but some were later coming out to us. Recomend the Scallop rolls in Filo dough strands.
The sweet egg custard buns were nice and not overly sweet but were steaming hot for a long time beware.
Pawn and Mango Sesame Fitters were also good and a hit with the three of us.
Pork Ribs with garlic rice was tasty.
Limited selection of drink avaliable on the menu.
Our deep deep fried bean curd rolls arrived so late we nearly missed them. Check your order. Too many waitresses involved in our service so not as good a service or attentive as they could have been.
Saying all the less positive things we still intend to return ,God willing, in the next month we are here in Singapore.
Would recommend you search Yum Cha out."
A Chinese and Chinatown Classic!,"Looking for a classic? It's been years since I took out-of-town guests to this place. Located in Chinatown. Simple, in a bit of a rundown building. The dim sum dishes were ok."
“I don’t trust you”- terrible customer service,"On going up to pay the bill, I tapped my credit card on the card reader. It beeped as if approved, but apparently didn’t go through. Instead of saying, “I don’t know what happened/ the machine didn’t work/ sorry can you try again,” the cashier said: “I don’t trust you.” I pointed out trust is a very strong word. I asked if she could double check, and even after having paid in cash to make sure, she said “I don’t trust you, I don’t trust you.” Food is fine, but not worth the terrible customer service. There are plenty of other dim sum restaurants to choose from."
The real chinese food. Frequent client.,The restaurant is in the heart of Chinatow! It's a real chinese restaurant. The food and service is very good.
"Tasty food, a great experience","Don't be frightened by the outside, and don't hesitate to take the elevator to this hidden restaurant. The place is not well-decorated, but it's full of local Chinese families, which is always a good sign. Staff is smiling and friendly, there is a great variety of dim sum options to choose from, but all of them are really good, tasty, with a lot of flavory juice inside! Much better than the so-called 'dim sum' specialist chain that is all over Singapore streets and malls... We loved it and will be back."
Paid for Tap Water,"After reading reviews on this restaurant decided would be a great place to go for a 30th birthday. How wrong we were, the food was plain & tasteless. The service was poor with the waitress unfriendly & hovering over us staring at us while we ate. Then when the bill arrived turns out we were charged for tap water, peanuts we didn’t order and also the wet wipes. Very disappointing experience and would not waste your time trying this place."
Hitea dim sum buffet,"Fresh and delicious dim sum, great value and fast service, item options so many, highly recommend place to try Hong Kong dim sum!"
Great dumplings,"Popped in for lunch. The steamed dumplings were all delicious. Service was great with trolleys whizzing round with all the dishes to choose from. We got in just in time as the queue was huge when we left.
Only negative was we were sat next to a leaking aircon unit that had a bowl under to catch the water that most people tripped over.
We had 6 portions of various dim sum and some steamed buns and it cost $46."
BEST DIM SUM WE EVER TASTED,We went for lunch at the recommendation of our hotel concierge and we both agree we had the best dim sum we have ever had. Walking around Chinatown before and after lunch was a bonus. The timing with Chinese new year made it more festive.
Lunch,"Place are not very up today, very old fashioned, selection is very good but portions are small. Service is not bad, because of dim sum restaurant in Singapore are very limited, this may be a only choice you can find here."
Great location and value for money,"Right in the heart of China town, it features more then 40+ selection of dim sum, in traditional style from breakfast to all day dinning. Good selection of bean curd, poultry & meat, & seafood dishes. The name ‘Yum Cha’ means ‘drink tea’ in Cantonese. So no coffee even during breakfast. Operation style is typical HK-push cart style, stressful, don’t speak much English, the authentic way... Dim sum per head cost is less than S$25 per head, with the best dishes. After the feast you could explore Chinatown on foot for more Chinese culture immersion. The real and dying stuff in Singapore."
Old place that could do with renovation,"Paid alacarte price for buffet food. Claim they raise price because of CNY. And it's not even CNY yet!

Value for money if u eat buffet. But price for alacarte is just bad. Many places have better dim sim (warm when its meant to be). Environment had a stench."
A experience not to be missed in China town,Food is excellent and served from bamboo baskets which makes it charming. A lot of Chinese families around us. We recommend the prawns with coriander dumpling and the scallop pea-shoot dumpling. Really good. And a must for the desert is the Pomelo Sago in Mango Juice. So good. Do not miss on that one.
Dumpling Feast,"If dumplings are your thing then this is the place to go. Always busy and frequented by large groups of locals and tourists alike. Very large selection of choices (only dumplings served), all tasty bit service can be slow and haphazard. Prices are reasonable and if you are a fan of din sun then this is a must visit."
not impressed overall,"we booked and had 2 tables. One table was full of singaporeans who obviously knew what was what, the other table was tourists where it was our first time. Service was not very good with one lady being quite rude when we tried to serve ourselves with some water from the trolley. Food was very average. However the toilets were clean and we appreciate the place is underging renovations. I can't comment on the prices as others paid."
Dim Sum Ala Carte Buffet,Ala carte dim sum buffet on weekday from 3pm to 6pm. Eat all you can. Very worth the money. Food quality is pretty good. Go early before the queue starts.
Renovation at the building food is mediocre,"The food is average but it’s ecpensive, many items not available. The renovation on the upper floor makes the dining experience worst!"
"Revisit after 16 yrs, no change, still great","Visited Yum Cha for first visit since 2002. Not sure anything had changed. Busy dim sum restaurant with great selection. Octopus great, paper wrapped chicken, char sui pau, plus others. All very tasty and very good value"
Food average. Service is warm and friendly,The variety is there but the quality is not. It’s not something to rave about. But I enjoy the traditional feel of the place and the trolley aunties deserve a shout out cos they are warm like family. My family of 5 ate about $97 incl GST - was a little more ex than I expected it to be. Granted we order without knowing the prices.
Great Buffet,A wonderful way to eat away the afternoon with delicious dim sum - not the flashiest place but great food is what you should go here for. Enjoy!
"Great Dimsum. Not a tourist trap, thankfully.","Friends and family had Dimsum from 4-6 PM and service was great. Food arrived fast. Be aware à la carte dishes (non-dimsum) are normally served only during lunch hours and after 5.30 PM.

Even if we didn’t mind ordering ahead only be served the crispy pork at 5.30 PM, the servers refused.

Servers are not very attentive but when we do succeed to get their attention, we get what we need right away.

Needless to say, still a great venue for a lovely afternoon catching up with friends. The most important thing is you bring good company, Yum Cha takes care of the good food!"
Dim Sum Fun!,"If you like Dim Sum, give Yum Cha a try. It is on the second floor on a corner, but the doorway is obscured by street stalls.
This is a great value. We had lunch for two for around 50 SGD, which is the least expensive lunch wee had in Singapore.
The selection was wide and the food well prepared. I particularly enjoyed the Abalone and my wife, who is a spring role fan, thought that they were as good as any we had in SE Asia.
The next time you are in China Town, give it a try!"
Lovely food service hit and miss,"Probably my 1st experience of dim sum. Trolleys are brought around with different dishes and you request the ones you want. What you order is marked on a card and totaled at the end, The food we had was very good. The staff were generally efficient although on a couple of occasions we requested food not on the trolleys..on the first occasion we never got the order and the second occasion we had to ask twice. It had clearly been forgotten as the waiter was most apologetic. Didn't really spoil my enjoyment.
The restaurant was very busy so things like that do happen. One of my favourite eating experiences whilst in Singapore"
"Excellent Yum Cha, one off / if not the Best in Singapore!","A hidden gem in Singapore's Chinatown and a fabulous change from food court dining. This restaurant may be difficult to find as it's upstairs and signage is not clear. Once found never forgotten. A lift is located at an entry on another street (parallel). The decor is old and tired but in keeping of Vintage times. Staff are dressed in a lovely red themed uniform and are friendly and attentive. Bookings is recommended for large groups and during busy periods as it does get noisy, otherwise the wait isn't too long. Don't expect personalised or over service during peak times as the goal of staff is to serve food ASAP.
The menu selection is large and as usual self marking of items and quantities makes it quick for service, make sure you order enough the first time as getting the staff attention can be difficult for further orders. The food comes out hot and fast and the empty steamers/plates cleared in ample time. All the dumplings are great and the crispy fried anchovies addictive. Peking duck also authentic and tasty.
Overall a satisfying experience which we do every trip to Singapore."
Average food and bad service,"It is my first time here at Yum Cha and since I am on leave on a weekday, I decided to use Fave voucher for the dim sum buffet. Went exactly at 3pm and the place was about 70% packed on a Friday afternoon.

It was difficult to get the attention of the staff to get our orders and frequently, they would tell us to wait first. After about 10 mins of getting their attention, they finally came over. Most of the staff were elderly. Nothing against them but they were complaining throughout that they were shorthanded and unhappy. Hence, it took them quite a long way to take orders. Our first order came quickly. But food was average although portion is big and good

Egg tart was average. Tart was not crispy enough. Har gao was huge too but the prawn filling was minced kind. Chee cheong fun was too bland and skin too thick. the single serving of double boiled soup was nice though and the char siew bao was good too.

However, won’t be going back again."
Love!,Yum Cha was a family favorite when we lived here 8 years ago...I am very happy to say it is only better than I remember!
Yum Cha Chinatown - Ok,"Both Chinatown and Changi's branch do not serve dim sum buffet during weekend. Food was average. Service was average, could detect impatience but was not rude, waved a cheerful goodbye and please come again.Chinatown branch was at a dimly lit side road and on the second floor, signage was not bright so it is possible to miss its entrance. Huge restaurant with inner section closed as there were not many customers even on a Sunday night."
Good dim sum with excellent Har Gao,"Visited this restaurant last weekend with my family. Had to wait a while as we were a party of 5 without any reservations. Got a seat soon enough and started ordering food - ordering as just pointing to the dim sum trolleys. One of the few rare restaurants that has dim sum trolleys where you just point at what you want. Har Gao (Steamed Prawn Dumplings) was excellent and very big - one of the best I have tasted. The rest were ‘good’ to ‘very good’. My Wife said that the Phoenix Claws were excellent (not my kind of thing). Overall, worth the trip there. Atmosphere was busy - not a place for quiet conversations :)"
Nice traditional snacks and price is average,You could find traditional chinese food and snacks with reasonable price. Air-con comfort with many varieties to choose from the menu. There is also a buffet style during 2 to 6pm period with all you can eat.
Nice food with good service,"The restaurant has a traditional feel to it. We were in a big group of 12 and the place was buzzing with patrons. Despite that, the service was courteous and prompt. Nice food with good value for money."
"Disappointing, to say the least","We went for lunch, looked forward to a dim sum lunch in Chinatown, and saw it was a past “Excellence Award” winner from TA.
Where to start: poor service, staff for most part didn’t care about service, do not know if it was because we are Westerners. Table next to us arrived later and received their food before us. We ordered 4 dishes, and waited FOREVER to get the last dish, staff appeared confused when we showed them on the order ticket we had not yet gotten our fourth dish. And, to save the best for last, they charge for peanuts (that are not ordered or eaten), and hand wipes on the table, again, customer not informed of the charge of 30 cents each. Not a big deal, as far as cost, but we felt it was petty and dishonest not to inform the customer. I refused to pay for the peanuts on principle, but we had already used the hand wipes, so what can one do. We were informed by the cashier “all restaurants in Chinatown charge this”. Food was average at best, I’ve had much better in SF Chinatown, would not go back, do not recommend."
A really fun place for an authentic dim sum experience,Very traditional dim sum restaurant serving a good variety of dim sum from a rolling cart and also you can order from the menu. I am a dim sum lover and this place is always great to go to. But be awrae it gets very crowded and you usually end up waiting on line unless you go at an off hour like 3:00PM. But it's worth it It can get bit loud and chaotic but that is part of the charm
Declining standards,"The retaurant has changed its methods for selling dim sum. Instead of pushing their foods around in carts, you're expected to order from a order form. You don't get to see what you order unlike in the past, you get what you see.
I ordered congee, expecting them to be served piping hot but turned out to be just luke warm. It was a disappointment. Ordered Xiao Long Bao, discovered some of them were broken in the tray. The rest are mediocre."
Unacceptable,Porridge lukewarm and tasteless. Think the hospital porridge taste better. The pork rib with garlic is all fat can’t b eaten. The roasted duck is soggy duck. Disappointed.
Average,"As a Cantonese, average dimsum cannot really be tolerated. Below are those I have eaten:-
1) Chee Cheong Fun - Unacceptable skin smoothness, it's rough and I can't even eat it .
2) Char Siew Pau - It looks presentable but it's all pastry (flour) and limited meat.
3) Prawn Wanton Crisps - Will never order again. Fillings not solid.
4) Meat Dumpling in Chilli Oil - Should be renamed to Meat Dumpling in Vinegar which is all to it.

What's Good/Acceptable
1) Egg Tart
2) Mango Pudding (Slightly on the sweeter side)
3) Xiao Long Bai - Rough skin but love the element of rice wine.
4) Xiao Mai and Har Gao - Solid and tasty.
5) Double Boiled Soup - Yummy!
6) Leaned Meat with Century Egg Congee - Ok

I won't list it all down. Go give it a try if you are a Safra Member or Maybank Card Holder. We came for High-Tea Buffet and we are satisfied. Value for money."
Delicious & reliable,"One of the few places left in Singapore with trolley service yum Cha, this is a busy and delicious set up. Good selection of steamed and other dim sum as well as all the usual suspects in Yum Cha. Loud, busy and great for groups- you come here for a good time not a long time! Get there early or late if you don’t want to have to queue!"
Yummy,"Yummy yummy yummy especially dimsum, all staffs and service was very good also. I like everything here."
Great lunch,"We have just had the best Yum Cha in Chinatown in Singapore. Great food, fried noodle scallops, fried crab claws,Beijing duck,roasted pork all really good. Can highly recommend this experience in Chinatown."
Yum Cha worst ever experience,"I think a lot of customers will regret coming to this restaurant like myself and my family. The food is average and the service is extremely bad, especially when taking away the leftovers, they will lump everything into one box of different varieties like junk. When approach the stuff, they responded with very bad attitude and forcing us to accept their insincere apology. BE CAREFUL of coming to this place."
"Tasty food , decent crowds on a sunday 10am morning","Family decided to venture to Chinatown for Yum Cha at 10am Sunday morning and was not disappointed. There was no queue but still fairly crowded. Food was great , and had alot of variety with the waiters and waitresses pushing carts of dim sum goodness !
New for this mth includes Bak kut teh Xiao Long Bao which was tasty .
If you have a craving for dim sum , pls visit Yum Cha at China town , you will leave the place satisfied !"
Average,Foods taste average. Nothing much special. Environment is a bit smelly unsure why. Not crowded. Easy accessable.
Ok - quite heavy,In fairness we may have made poor choices! The dim sum did seem to be more substantial than flavourful. Nice environment and staff.
"Awesome Dim Sum Buffet, great value, nice ambience n great attentive staff","Not my first visit to Yum Cha Restaurant, happy that food and service still good. The aunties were very nice and attentive to my kids, ensuring food are served fast so that wont get hungry. Nice variety of dim sums, love most of the items. We enjoyed it. Would be nice if they can have family buffet rates/sets. Think kids do not eat too much so buffet price is slightly high, but overall experience, good!"
Wonderful Dim Sum Restaurant,A real treat if your visiting China Town. Its located on 2nd floor. A true foodie pit stop you must experience.
여러종류의 딤섬을 맛보고 싶을때,"여러종류의 딤섬을 맛보고싶을때 방문합니다. 망고새우 들어간 딤섬과 새우 딤섬 정말 추천합니다 ! 평일 저녁에 가면 사람이 별로 많지 않아서 더 좋은것 같아요!
I must compliment Ms Siew Lan, she was very helpful and we are highly touched with her kind service. We definitely will visit again!"
Overpriced and overrated,"After a number of recommendations, we went to this restaurant for dinner. We ordered 3 dumpling dishes, a roast pork dish, vegetables and drinks.
I’ve had MUCH better food in Sydney for a much cheaper price in very much nicer surroundings. In fact, I’ve had way better dumplings at our Thursday night street markets.
To add insult to an already poor meal, we ordered a glass of beer each that turned out to be $10.50. EACH!
Even worse, we were given a bowl of peanuts (not requested) and a packaged wet wipe each (also not requested) and upon reading our payment receipt, found we were charged for these items. There were no napkins provided at the table.
The decor is old and depressing and everything just looks and feels like the place has seen long gone, much better days.
We’ve eaten at all kinds of street vendors throughout SE Asia, we’re definitely not picky, fussy customers but I can also say that we’ve enjoyed a $10 meal 100 times more than we enjoyed this.
Don’t waste your time or money, we just wasted $90 so that we can save anyone reading this from wasting their money too."
Dim Sum on wheels,The unique selling point is the dim sum trolleys which brought back nostalgic memories when I was a child in Hong Kong. But that’s about it. The food is pretty average. The place is a bit tattered. Staff not particularly responsive. Any novelty value wears off very quickly.
Good selection of tasty food,"After a morning at Gardens by the Bay, my group of eight was famished. So we cabbed it to Yum Cha where we ordered so much food we were afraid we had overdone it. We hadn't. We ate it all. My mouth is watering remembering the meal. Four stars instead of five because service was a little chilly and a couple of dumplings were a little gummy (but we were at end of lunch service, which may have contributed to that)."
