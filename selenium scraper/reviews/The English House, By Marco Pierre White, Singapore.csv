"Always an enjoyable experience, but getting pricey",The double shop house experience packed with British 1960s and 70s memorabilia is fascinating. Service is impeccable. Food is generously proportioned and delicious. Prices are getting a little on the heavy side so The English House needs to tread carefully.
Beautiful Place and Wonderful Service Crew,"I was recommended to dine at the English House by one of my friend, she told me that the food there taste amazing so upon hearing the words of mouth from her, I decided to give it a try. Each time when the food were served, the service crews would introduce the different dishes to me. I ordered Fish and Chips, Cottage Pie, lobster dumpling and The Box Tree Eton Mess all of them tasted amazing. The fish and chips was delicious, crispy on the outside and tender inside, the cottage pie I had was the best pie I ever had so far.

I’m really impressed by their friendly, professional and enthusiastic attitude, the way they spoke to me was heartwarming. I love the place it gives off a cozy feel just like home especially the little corners with the display cabinets . I will definitely visit again, this place is really a gem unlike other restaurants I visited. Thank you so much to the wonderful people who served me and congratulated me with a cake for my graduation. Love the people there"
Great Food and Exercise Service,"We stepped inside with great ambience, sat down on some nice cosy seats. We had an amazing dinner and Mae Ann was serving us with the utmost care. The food is superb, kudos to the chefs, definitely say the whole team are amazing. We definitely coming back."
Fine Dining at its Best,"No better way to end the year with family dinner in this enchanting place. The food is also top class! For a family of 5, we shared starters of potted duck rillettes, smoked salmon pate and turkey pate. For the mains, we had Scottish fillet Wellington, pan seared cod, pork belly with crackling and chilli crab & prawn noodles. And the must-have desserts of tiramisu and crème brûlée. Plus 2 bottles of wine, total bill was S$916 - quite steep but definitely worth it for celebration dinners."
Great food and Hospitality,"Visited here as a planned meal for our wedding anniversary last December.
Great service, food was lovely, had the Roast Pork Bell , great portions and the Beef Wellington was amazing!
Prices were acceptable too, can’t go wrong!
The Manager was so nice he brought our dessert out with Happy Anniversary on and even gave us complimentary chamgagne. Very thoughtful and very much appreciated. Thank you English House for the great hospitality and a memorable night to remember. We will definitely return on our next visit in Singapore."
Consistent food and service with a great atmosphere,"I have dined here several times over the course of 2022 with friends, family and work colleagues - including my most recent visit for lunch on Christmas Day. The service and food have always been at expected levels(high!) with generous proportions and served in a friendly manner. The option of Chinese/local dishes alongside traditional British food is very welcome in a multicultural city
The setting is lovely, with many wonderful photographs and quirky items decorating the restaurant. It's a brasserie style resto, not fine dining, and the relaxed atmosphere enhances the whole experience. I look forward to more visits in 2023!"
A terrific evening in Singapore,"Four of us were in Singapore for our final evening before early morning flights. We fancied steak after several Chinese meals and Marco's name helped us to decide.

What followed exceeded our expectations hugely. A wonderfully and esoterically decorated dining room where we enjoyed well made Bloody Marys followed by truly exceptional potted duck which reminded me of the old, and much missed, Dorchester Grill. All if us had rare sirloins with powerful horseradish and the meat was just right. A little fat to add flavour and stunning texture.

The waiter recommended the Amarone which neede 15 minutes breathing time but was then full bodied and smelt great.

Desert had to he the crumble which was all we had hoped for.

All in all a great night and I look forward to eating there again on my next visit."
Amazing food,"Great food, I have to say , fish & chips and scottish roasted beef... I love beef and personally Grass-fed, better favour, clean taste.. plus beautiful interior design.."
Disappointing in the least,"No table cloth, no candle, a thrift shop Christmas cracker given obviously reluctantly. Prawn cocktail starter served in some sort of soup bowl with about four tiny prawns in. Christmas dinner was ok quite tasty but having sat down at 3.30pm was told at 4pm there was no Christmas pudding left! Really? Beautiful building but not very beautiful experience. Scrooge would approve, I didn’t."
Fine Cuisine and Great Hospitality Experience,"Breath taking experience when stepping into the restaurant. The deco and ambience, easy one mind off from from the hectic work, to enjoy a simple Christmas dinner with family.

The pudding and turkey was well prepare. My kids enjoyed the pudding and was thinking of asking for more but decided not to as the staff were too busy then. Though I don't fancy turkey, but the turkey was really awesome.

Great work to the team, putting their mind and soul into whipping out fine festive meal and great hospitality to their customers.

My family, especially the kids were looking forward to our next dining experience with the restaurant."
Disappointed,"The food was fine, but not worth the money. We went for the December festive food. The turkey wasn't a real turkey, but just some sort of turkey roll. I was not good. The menu stated that the Christmas pudding came with brandy sauce, but it was more of the sort of sauce you'd expect to find with sticky toffee pudding. I expected there to be Christmas crackers on the tables, as the promotional materials had pictures and I'm sure there were crackers when I visited two years ago - but no. I've been to this restaurant twice now, and while the building is lovely (but why, why, do they have those yellow male and female statues that look like toilet signage in the middle of the restaurant?!), it's just too expensive for the quality of food."
Christmas Dinner to forget,"My wife and I were very excited about trying this restaurant as we had heard from friends it was worth a visit. We decided to go for Christmas dinner as a traditional festive meal was on the menu and this would hopefully ease the feeling of missing loved ones back in the UK.
I must admit I thought it was very poor: first we were sat down my wife was given a children’s menu and I was given the adult festive menu (simple mistake) this was rectified semi promptly. No side plates on the table the entire meal no cutlery in the table as we arrived. No introduction to the menu, no welcome from maitre d. Once the meal came out the whole thing just became more dreary ; Turkey roll was rock solid, my wife had two bites of the Scotch egg as it was tasteless. As we looked round the restaurant we noticed other diners had Christmas crackers we ask for them and took ages to arrive. Burrata was very good then followed the steak which was so chewy and tasteless, we were given a small amount of gravy on plate no offers from server for any other sauce option. Also no salt on the table which is just bizarre posing as a UK styled restaurant.
Tiramisu extremely watery and tasteless. We were also continually reminded that we only had the table for 1.5 hours we actually didn’t even use that time as we were quite happy to leave $507 later I certainly would not bother. I’ve been to 3 star restaurants and eaten at $4 hawker and everything in tween, I would choose a hawker every time if I knew this is what I would be eating. For the UK expats here this is like any roadside carvery that you would spend £15 without the taste.

This is a real shame because the building itself is so petty and is quite nicely done inside. Food is really not up to much though"
Fine. But not worth the money.,"The food is fine but they use mostly frozen. Some items are good (the Scotch Egg for example). But spend your money elsewhere for a lot better. For nearly $100 a meal I expected a lot better. And the service, and in particular in the owner, is a genuinely awful. Just go somewhere else in Singapore. A hawker market for example. Atmosphere is also like a cheap family restaurant in Australia."
Fabulous festive menu,"Had an amazing lunch on 23 Dec. We ordered 3 main courses: turkey, beef and lamb. For the first time, I don’t have to handle a bony lamb dish, which is usually the case whenever I order a lamb shoulder. It’s pure lamb meat, which was such a pleasure. All the dishes were cooked to perfection, including the scotch egg appetiser, and the desserts. It has been our annual ritual to come to the English House for festive lunch and we will continue to do so next year."
Incredible space with some hits and misses,"The decor is a feast for the eyes, even before you eat. With incredible photography and curious artefacts, it truly is worth looking around.

I went specifically to try the beef wellington which I shared with my husband. It is very expensive so my expectations were high. The meat was delicious. Perfectly cooked, soft and succulent. However there was a real lack of duxelle/pate surround it which was really disappointing. Hence it was more meat in pastry sadly. I still ate every bit but likely won’t have it again :(

The Scotch egg, creamed spinach and other diners roast pork plates were all very good. The triple cooked chips were a good sized portion but not as they should be in terms of crunchy outside and fluffy inside, more like regular chips.

Service was overall good, with some improvement opportunities given how many staff there were e.g water refills we had to ask multiple time and starters not all served at the same time meaning some went cold as we waited on the others.

So I would go back but will pass on the Wellington next time!"
Great food with great service,"We came on sunday dinner, It was a fantastic dining experience. The great decor and ambience showcased the english vintage and retro atmosphere. The foods were excellent and well seasoned and their desserts were immaculate. We enjoyed the hospitality. Staffs were friendly and helpful. Will definitely come back."
Excellent,The food was DELICIOUS and the service was friendly. The duck and turkey were perfectly cooked and the Christmas pudding was to die for!
Excellent Xmas meal,"Had a really good Xmas meal here with a group of friends. We ordered the special menu items and none disappointed. The sides especially like Brussels sprouts were so well done. Overall the venue looked cosy and inviting, the food was excellent and the service was impeccable."
"Great ambience, service and delicious beef Wellington!","Had a wonderful birthday dinner celebration at English House. The ambience was great, beef wellington was delicious 😋 and thank you to May and her team for the excellent service🙏😃. We will definitely recommend visiting and cant wait for our next visit!:)"
Amazing lunch with friends,"Amazing service and food, one of the best decorated restaurant I’ve been. The service staffs are very attentive to details Would recommend this place for dates and Sunday brunch."
Festive season,"When there during lunch time and it was very pack and when I was walking in I saw most of the table had roast turkey on the table so I decided to order and try it , guess what I never regret ordering it. The portion is huge and the Yorkshire pudding is so cute…"
Amazing Asian Cuisine by an Englishman,"We came for our date night earlier this week where we enjoyed a sumptuous dinner together.

One of the dishes we ordered was probably the most expensive Hor Fun we’ve ever eaten… but I would go back again just for this.

The restaurant had a great retro vibe and amazing food and service to match. A little pricey to visit regularly but definitely a place for special occasions!"
Best roast in Singapore,Had the festive menu with my wife and our opinion simply the best restaurant in Singapore. The service was impeccable.
Beautiful Turkey and Christmas Pudding,"Had an amazing time here. First impressions of the place was WOW!

Amazing Gardens and Beautifully eccentric art pieces greets you at the reception. The walk to my table had my eye being kept amused by all the artifacts in the dining room as well. You may mistaken it for a museum!

It was a full house when I entered and it was great seeing the dining room ""alive"". This is one of the few indicators for me to know that the dining experience and food will be great.

Ordered the Roast Turkey for my mains and it did not disappoint. Turkey was cooked to perfection, no faults about it. Tender, flavourful and juicy. The kitchen team must have spent countless hours brinding the big bird to have this outcome. The trimmings (especially the Yorkshire Puddings) were generous and tasty. Special mention on the gravy. It tasted so deliciously good that I imagine every single ounce of flavour has been extracted out from the bones to create the stock and it has been reduced for a long time to create the gravy. Not surprised if my theory is true, it was so good!

One thing that I do can confirm would be the Christmas Pudding. I've learned from the friendly staff that the Christmas Pudding has been specially brought in from England. The Pudding is made by Wilkin and Sons in the small village of Tiptree where they're still making the puddings by hand. A very rare art that is still being praticed. With finest ingredients used like French Brandy, Cider and their famous marmalade is one of their key ingredients.

The Pudding was soft, rich and full of vine fruits. Absolutely divine and the most perfect way for finishing Christmas Lunch in style

The proof is indeed in the pudding. Pun intended

Nonetheless, it was a great festive lunch. Kudos to Marco & the team here in Singapore. A true taste of Britain in Singapore."
Best Turkey ever tasted,"Had my Christmas meal here. Roast Turkey was moist and tender, flavourful and beautifully cooked. Highly recommend."
Shockingly bad meal,"Quite honestly this was massively disappointing. Upon arrival there a very pungent aroma of what may have been lemon balm and industrial pest control chemicals. It was not a good start. There was only a “festive menu” on offer (3rd December….) and I selected the Roast Turkey which was priced at around $60. What actually arrived was 6 thin slices of pressed meat. It may have been Turkey, at least in part, but it tasted totally bland for the single bite that I took. The Yorkshire Puddings (not traditionally served with a Christmas Turkey dinner - but I usually like them) was equally as awful. Small, thick, served too cold, unappetising and reminded me of some very cheap frozen ones that can be bought by the family size bag. The gravy was actually jus. There was too little of it, especially given how poor the rest of the meal was. You can usually cover up a dodgy meal with a really good gravy. Maybe they should try it? The Christmas pudding was too small and too sweet for my taste. For $20 I would have thought that the English House might have made their own pudding, but I was assured that it was “imported from England” - so you could go to your Singapore supermarket and buy one, pop it in the microwave and have the same culinary experience. They removed the Turkey from the bill but I still left feeling unfed and ripped off. MPW has a lot of work to do to save his brand if this experience is anything to go by."
Best restaurants,"[11/27, 15:50] haha again back to my favorites restaurant surprised again with the Yorkshire pudding.

Extraordinary Sunday Roast and sensational mini Yorkshire Pudding .

Genius idea of making Yorkshire Pudding this way.

It was so crispy and moist compare to the bigger sibling. Taste so much better too.
Sometimes small is beautiful!"
Sublime experience. Bravo Marco and The English House team in Singapore doing the establishment proud.,"Great Sunday Lunch at the English House. Our first visit last Sunday. Understated as Marco intended , but as we ascended up the stairs past the lovely greenery into the lobby there was a very nice buzz and ambience. Got a great table at the end of the main hall, and enjoyed the new Sunday Roast menu from Scotch Eggs/Sausage Rolls and starters , to mains, Fish & Chips and Wellingtons cooked superbly (batter , cod , and pastry/sauces on point) . Thank you to the staff that made a great impression , and in particular Lily who proactively but without airs showed us around the place and shared the history and memorabilia with great passion and made us feel very welcome like any great host would - making her guests feel welcome. Our family very much enjoyed the quaint ambience , eclectic surroundings, tasty food and friendly service we received with a smile, a hallmark of any great establishment. Will visit again for dinner and some cocktails during the Christmas festive season very soon. Well done Marco and the Singapore team at The English House. Andrew A and family."
eggs benedict,"I enjoy the food on their brunch menu, loved the softest-possible poached eggs with the Hollandaise sauce. must try the eggs benedict.will definitely go back again."
love this food,"The beef was delicious beyond description, and had my taste buds was pleading with me to take another bite. The pastry and beef was cooked to a divine perfection. Stoddarts beef wellington i will try again soon hop"
A little disappointing to be honest,"We came as a family of four for a Friday dinner together, but this place feels like it's on that usual slide that seems to happen in Singapore after a year or two. Items missing on the menu, wines not available (despite there only being 6 whites on the menu as a whole), food a bit slow, fish and chips a bit underdone and average, waitresses constantly asking whether the food was ok, can they clear plates etc., robotic rather than quality service - I won't go back"
Good environment to enjoy food .,"Good dim sum with fresh sea prawn , nice platting look ,good service and will definitely go back again and introduce other ppl to go."
Perfect Sunday lunch,"The name Marco Pierre White speaks for itself. And then the welcoming service, the attentiveness: don’t see that kindness very often. Lastly the decor: in that heritage house with the b/w photos as conversation pieces. Do try the Sunday Roast and the Eton Mess for dessert, and come with a healthy appetite!"
MPW would be proud,Enjoyed the experience from start to finish.. scotch egg and beef welly truly outstanding Chef and staff looked after us well - will return soon
One of the best restaurant,"Today, I went to my favourite restaurant, The English House to have a meal and I heard from one of their staff, Tiffany that they are launching a new menu for brunch on the 11 of November. Looking forward to it! They also did not disappoint us with their nice and good quality food. Will be back for the new brunch menu!"
Must try the beef Wellington,Many thanks for the desert to celebrate our one year anniversary. The beef Wellington is so nice that we will try again.
an excellent meal,there was a classic surprise. owner wife was a good friend of ANOTHONY BOURDAIN who gave her some of his collectible items. Among them was Bourdain's chef knife on display in restaurant. Cool!
Best fish & chips and beef wellington in Singapore,My sister who had been in the UK for many years was looking for good fish & chips locally. So glad we had a wonderful dining experience at The English House. Beef wellington was also good. Too bad they ran out of olives for the burrata.
Family dinner,Pork and prawn dumpling in szechuan sauce are the best. Highly recommended the cote de boeuf and the fish and chips.
Beef wellington,The scottish beef was tender and tasty. Recommended to those wanting to experience the best wellington in Singapore.Excellent service.
East as good as the West,The English house without saying serves the best western cuisine in town. But their Chinese dim sum and Chinese dishes are as good ! Compliments from elderly members from my family who only diet is Chinese cuisine. Have their approval to host family meals cos does satisfy the young and old with good and delicious meals of their own preference ! A happy meal as one !
The go-to for Sunday Roast in Singapore,"A frequent patron of the Sunday Roast - definitely my favourite Sunday brunch/lunch spot in Singapore!

(1) Food is delicious and comes in generous portions;
(2) Service is attentive and efficient; and
(3) Ambience is relaxed and classy at the same time.

Would highly recommend for a nice weekend brunch/lunch!"
Always a great experience,Starr and Manager always gave their best during my visit. Love coming here for the food and also the service. Thanks Muhammad. You always deliver!
Delicious Lamb at English House,"The day I visited, the special was rack of lamb dijonaise. Ordered the lamb as I was curious on the restaurant's take on such a classic dish. Fortunately it managed to exceed my expectations! The lamb was flavourful and juicy. The gravy served also complimented the lamb very well. Bravo!"
Let down - What a shame,"We have been frequenting the English House for the last five years and have always loved the place, the staff and, why you would always frequent a MPW restaurant, the food!! The place is still something to enjoy with the pictures and memorabilia, very special. The staff out front are the very best and chief Gabriel is amazing which is why the staff out front LOVE him. What I don’t understand is that the last two or three weeks the food has dropped off a cliff. It’s bland and cold and for the first time in years I have had to send it back on each visit - tonight was the staw that broke the camels back and this review is upsetting to write but needed.

Please re-think whatever it might be you have changed in the last few weeks as you have most certainly gone backwards and I for one won’t be frequenting again.

Sad"
Everything was excellent,"I know the place from my son who's now studying abroad Everything was very very good and the stuff are very friendly, we will definitely come again."
Exceptional service!,"The food at The English House is exceptional! Very tasty and well prepared and you can choose among many menu options. I love the service at the place and the Manager is so friendly with the guests. He is extremely knowledgeable and made great recommendations. The best fish and chips I have ever tasted. Didn’t feel bloated or greased up like you do with other fish and chip places.
I highly recommend this place.

Will drop by again soon."
Celebrity Restaurant,"Unfortunately, it’s a miss for me and my family. We went there to celebrate my daughter’s birthday. Well, I did prepare to pay the price and hoped to devour the delectable food, but sadly, the food wasn’t special. The restaurant was indeed tastefully and beautifully decorated.

Moreover, the captain that served us didn’t show us the full menus available on Sundays. We were only given the English Sunday Roast Menu, and we did ask for other menus, but he said none.

We were the first table for the evening. Moments later, we saw other tables that came after were served with dim sum baskets. So we tried to clarify with the captain again, then he only apologised and told us that he had left out the Chinese Menu. We tried to be calm and accepted for what we had ordered and tried to enjoy the food. Unfortunately, that incident had probably altered our expectations for the English House."
Excellent service n food,We thought prices were expensive but overall standard was v good. Restaurant ambience was great and not noisy. Service was awesome! I was nearby and caught in the heavy rain and called the restaurant for help. One of the service staff Sue came to my rescue with an umbrella- thank you so much!
Excellent,"Ordered lobster noodles, cod fish & chips and pan cod fish and iberico pork. The fish and chip was excellent. Will be back for more."
Surely will be back soon 🙂,Again n again back to my favorites restaurant always have great food always this time we try the claypot rice n Timsum fantastic fresh everything is so fresh n good good quality nowhere else an find in Singapore! For sure 😘
Best Sunday Roast in Singapore,Nearest thing to an English roast I’ve had in Singapore. Service excellent and will definitely be back.
"Good food, great service!","Ordered the fish & chips and pan seared cod-fish, with some dim sums. Food was very good, staff was attentive as well :)"
Feast for your eyes,What a fabulous place. Such Interesting decor to feast your eyes on while waiting for food to arrive. Food was excellent. My only criticism was that there weren't many vegetables to choose as accompaments for our meal. Nice touch serving dessert on Wedgwood plates. Will definitely visit again when next in Singapore
Unforgettable experience. Great food. Generous portions.,"Before leaving a review I would like to applaud to the people from the hospitality industry for their perseverance during this extremely difficult post Covid time.
It is sad to see closure of very well established restaurants in Singapore due to manpower issue and high rising cost. This is the new trend and traditional food will eventually vanished for good.

Normally my average spending in fine Japanese restaurants in Singapore is around 500 per person on food excluding sake.

I visited The English House for Sunday Roast and the experience is unforgettable.
Food quality, service, ambience tick all the boxes of a great restaurant. They embrace the philosophy of the Great Marco Pierre White which is good food must be served hot.

The price for the quality and generous portion is a steal.
I will make this place my canteen and will definitely recommend friends to visit."
Absolutely Amazing,"The placeis beautiful and stafg are super friendly the food is delicious with the generous amount of food , especially highly recommend assorted preserved meat claypot rice"
Really bad!!! We won’t be going back.,"This used to be a regular haunt for us, as Brits we love our roasts, this used to be by far the best roast dinner in Singapore, but my goodness has this place changed! Across our two plates of main course that we received, everything was cold, the meat, the vegetables and even the gravy. We each received a single cold limp roast potato! In a fine dinning establishment, who serves your meal to the table when none of the party are seated (By the way staff knew we had gone out and was not even a minute between them letting us know food was ready to us returning, so can’t even use the excuse that it was sat there for ages)?To pay $80 for what was worse than a microwave dinner you get in a pub was ridiculous. Perhaps if the chef had spent ANY time in the kitchen overseeing quality of what was going out as opposed to acting like a celebrity chef in front of house we might have got a quality meal. Why has the menu changed? Who puts ice cream in an Eaton Mess? Husband and I both decided we won’t be going back!

Marco Pierre White, take your name off this restaurant, it’s an insult to your brand."
Great service staff,"We visited on 24th June 2022, Friday for our wedding anniversary celebration. We were specially impressed with the service staff for her patience and enthusiasm in taking many pictures for us and not to mention her overall great service as well!
We are also grateful to the restaurant who gave us a complimentary cake. This is not to be taken for granted as some restaurants don't do it.
Great job!"
Nice experience,"Good food especially the veggie options, wine not that great and ambience is not very cosy more tavern style"
Words are just not enough,"Without a doubt the best restaurant experience I have ever had. This is the first review I have ever been moved to write!

Welcome to a journey into a dimension of hospitality where every detail is precise and perfect , but not fussy or pretentious. As we climbed the stairs and entered the restaurant reception, we were immersed into the theme and decor that transported us into an alternate creation of time and space, a skilful blend of classic English furniture, art and artefacts woven into the architecture of a Singaporean Shophouse, simply magnificent.

We joined the Sunday Brunch service, for the occasion of my Wife's birthday. Whilst enjoying a cold and crisp Freedom Lager and a glass of Pol Roger Brut Reserve we explored the menu , and as we asked our waitress for some advice regarding our dishes we were visited by Maitre d/Chef Gabriel , he listened to our questions (and that we wanted to share), he then explained the dishes and aligned our menu choices . As we chose the Fish and the Duck (Chinese) dishes he offered a complimentary slice of the roast pork to complete our table.

We had Dim Sum to start , and shared Crab and Prawn, Foie Gras and Lobster with crab sauce.
Main Dishes consisted of sweet&sour Wild Cod , Roast Pippa Duck and alongside the generous slice of roast pork (served with a jug of the most wonderful gravy). Our meal was truly a feast. A glass or two of the house French red suited the meal and was an easy choice.
For desert we shared a baked apple crumble.

Any complexity of preparation was invisible , every dish was plated and presented to show off the great produce used , it seemed that there was just the correct elements on the plate , nothing to be added or removed. Understated perfection. Generous portions and delicious.

Of all the menu advice from Gabriel, the best was to understand the serving size and not to over order ..... and we still left with a takeaway container for a tasty evening snack back at the hotel.
We will certainly be back soon."
Food excellent but limited kids menu,"This was the second time we’ve visited The English House - the first was on New Year’s Day when there was an expansive menu for kids, including (crucially!) a Sunday Roast. When we returned on Mother’s Day, the kids menu was limited to two Italian dishes. My kids ended up sharing an adult portion of the roast, which was fine but made it very expensive. Please MPW, give kids what they want - a roast! Otherwise, the food is excellent and the serving staff are friendly but sometimes a little slow."
Birthday Celebration,"Great food, Nice ambience and excellent services. Must try Beef Wellington.. and also Roast Duck is super yummy."
The english house,"The food at The English house is exceptional! Very tasty and well prepared and you can chose among many menu options, especially the hongkong dim sum is so good. I also love the service at the place and the chef is so friendly with the guests and always takes care to offer the best quality! I highly recommend this place"
Mother’s Day dinner,"Made a reservation 2 weeks in advance, however seating was apparently not ready and had to wait upon arrival for staff to check and locate us a seat… one that had to be cleared and in a corner at the very end where one could see some storages…. Basically the one corner where no one would like to be seated."
Disappointing,Second time visiting and came specifically because of the roast dinner. Very disappointing to find now no roast potatoes or vegetables included in the price. Side dishes were extra money and there was nothing that my mum (who’s birthday it was) or myself liked. We ordered the lamb and to receive a massive plate with two fillets on (before We had 3/4 fillets) was a bit sad. Only mashed potato and no vegetables. It was supposed to come with mint sauce but the staff forgot it. When I asked why there wasn’t the traditional roast as before I was told it’s only for Sunday and when I visited before it must have been a Sunday. When we visited last year it was December and my husband’s birthday and it was a weekday as his birthday was during the week so to be told full roast is only sold on a Sunday was untrue. Extremely disappointed and didn’t really make the evening feel nice as my mum was expecting a full roast as that’s what I’d told her there would be. She is very fussy and likes traditional roast. She had to ask for the lamb to be heated up as it was cold. She complained about there being no vegetables that she liked too. The pricing seems to have been increased excessively and it’s the most I’ve ever paid for a dinner for 4 in a restaurant. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the amount a paid even in a 5 star hotel and I’ve lived in Singapore for 13 years and visited many restaurants and hotels over this period. It’s sad to say I won’t be visiting again with the current offerings for roast selections and the pricing too.
Wonderful experience,"Absolutely beautiful, best for taking photos. Staffs including the chief are so friendly and kind. We really have a wonderful time."
Perfect service and Food,"Excellent service accompanied by nice ambience. We had the Foie Gras Terrine Seasonal Truffle, Fresh Cratmeat & Prawn Dumplings(虾饺), Foie gras Pork Dumplings(烧卖),Seasonal mixed vegetables, English duck, Fillet of Lamb, Aberdeen Black Angus Cote de Boeuf, Wellington Cod fish, Mr White Tiramisu, Baked Apple Crumbled, Lemon tarts...

We were very impressed and happy with the whole dining experience.

Highly recommended.

Oh ya, took a pic of the late Anthony Bourdain custom chef's knife too ♥️"
A wonderful experience with top-notch service,"It was our first visit and a special birthday occasion. We have been searching for a good beef wellington in Singapore and this place finally fulfil our taste bud! The food was excellent and the overall atmosphere is very relaxing.

A big thank you to Fareed for his top-notch hospitality throughout the evening! He took care of our group and gave us ample recommendations on the menu. Our birthday boy even got a cake on the house! Thanks Fareed, you made our experience memorable!

Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a comfortable atmosphere, top notch service, and impeccable food."
Excellent food and service,"We had been welcomed and served by their friendly staff, Sue, Tiffany and Grace. I had to ask for their recommendations since it was my first time in their resto. For starter, we tried their prawn and crabmeat dumpling, and the foie gras dumpling, which we didn't manage to to take photos of because they were too mouthwatering to resist, we digged in just right after they were served in front of us.

Their beef wellington is not their best seller for nothing, it was definitely far better than the other wellingtons I tried in other places. Excellent proportion of the perfectly-cooked tender meat and the pastry.

It was an overall great dining experience."
Quaint Dining Experience with a Fantastic Atmosphere,"I visited this place on a weekend for dinner with an old friend and was immediately fascinated by the decor and mood/lighting of the restaurant upon stepping in. Despite offering a variety of cuisines (Dim Sum in an English House?), each dish ordered was prepared well and on point. We did not try the beef wellington but will return for sure to try it. Service was excellent as well and we left as happy and satisfied diners.

Will be back for sure!"
Fantastic service & food!,"The English House is without a doubt the best restaurant for quality service and food! We've
recent celebrated my engagement with my family and had a terrific time. The staff are truly attentive, kind and so welcoming especially Alberto and Fareed (who kept our spirits high throughout)! The food and dessert we received was so good and the portion was generous too. I must say the Ethan Mess and Apply crumble was the top in our list for desserts. Extremely clean and classy place. Worth the money spent. Will definitely return!"
"Good, but at that price I need more","Good food, but strictly average service. Didn’t quite do it for me overall… With the super exorbitant prices you expect outstanding food and top of the line service. Falls short at least to some extent on all counts."
These guys are awesome.,"I have never left a review from all the times I have been using Chope, but I must say hands down these guys from the head chef ( bald head from Italy, sorry I can’t remember your name :-)) to all the staff as usual you guys rock.

Italian chef made the one go with the main meal and made me a special desert to go with the wine after. Again thanks. Maybe this is why I keep coming back? Takes a lot to impress me and now you have."
16 April 2022,"It was my first visit to The English House. While the decor was interesting it was the handmade Hong Kong dim sum available for dinner that surprised me pleasantly. Instead of 3 or 4 in a basket, the dim sum were singletons but big enough for sharing between the 2 of us. The dim sum ingredients were fresh and cooked just right but the crystal skin for the dumplings was just that little bit too chewy. We shared the fish and chis for the main, and it was definitely on par with some of the best fish and chips I had in London in the last few years. The tiramisu was fine and such a big piece that 3 persons could have enjoyed it. And kudos to Mr Mohamed Fareed who took very good care of us! Definitely a restaurant that I will return with family and friends."
Perfect Saturday Evening at The English House,"First time visiting The English House with my partner and a friend. We were all extremely impressed and would definitely schedule a second visit here. Upon entering the restaurant, it seemed like we have time-travelled. The restaurant’s interior is really well-curated and gives a sense of comfort to all of us. The service from the staff was impeccable right from the point when we entered the restaurant. We would like to specially commend the good service of Tiffany who had attended to us with care. Thanks to her recommendations, we did not miss out in the star dishes. We had the Classic Hong Kong Prawn Toast as a start followed by Foie Gras Terrine Seasonal Truffle, Traditional Fish & Chips, Beef Wellington and summed up with Mr. White’s Tiramisu and The Box Tree Eton Mess. Every dish was superb but if I can only choose one dish in this restaurant, I will definitely go for the Beef Wellington. It was perfectly executed! Overall, we were satisfied with experience here and would strongly recommend family and friends to come here for the dining experience."
My favourite restaurant in Singapore!,"Our favorite restaurant in Singapore! We keep coming back! Today we had the most glorious fish and chip, now with thick fillet Atlantic Cod!!! Perfect with mushy peas, tartare sauce and triple cooked chips! Definitely worth a visit!!"
Best beef cheek ever tasted,"Service was excellent.foie gras terrine , fish n chips was good but beef cheek was the best . Didnt need to use fork or knife , literally melt in your mouth"
Top Service & High Quality Food,"Very pleased with the top level of service, and the food was of a superior quality. The Asian cuisine are extremely well prepared and keeps us wanting more. The interior is also uniquely retro with a modern twist, and has a very strong Hong Kong movie vibes. Love my first experience here and will definitely come back again!"
The most amazing wedding celebration!,"The biggest thank you to the team at The English House for making our special day extra special. From service, to the food, to the ambience - we went from loving you guys from our first visit, to absolutely adoration

The dimsum starters were amazing and Sunday roast as usual was . I also want to say special thanks for putting together the Yorkshire puddings and all the trimmings for us despite it being a Wednesday, as well as the champagne and cakes. We will be back in a heartbeat!"
The English House review,"I'm a frequent patron of The English House 3 times a week in average. I just want the team to know you have done an amazing job looking after the customers and delivering top notch food.
It's sad to see people giving negative reviews but that's ok. Be confident with your food and service because they are excellent.
Marco will be proud of the achievements in this very demanding market.
The Sunday Roast and cantonese dishes on Sunday are sensational keeping the fundamental of classical food which is hot and delicious.
All the best and stay safe.

Great Experience,"l wish I could give this place 10 stars!! What delicious food and warm hospitality from all the staff. We ordered dimsum and sausage rolls as starter which were so so delicious.
Our mains were nothing short of amazing. Roast lamb was so tender, succulent and filled with gamey flavour. The accompaniments that came with it were full of flavour. I especially love the yorkshire pudding. My mom and dad having Fish and Chips, they both love it. So far the best Fish & Chips in Singapore.

Overall we really enjoyed this place. The lovely ambience, interior decoration was amazing. A definite hidden gem!"
Happy coming back again,"This place is great! Atmosphere is chill and coo. Owner of the restaurant spend good effort in decorating the restaurant and it look like a museum. the staff is also really friendly. and you can tell making the customers happy is their main priority. Food is very awesome , some English classics and surprisingly hongkong classic food can be found in it and for their prices it’s 100% worth it."
Very ordinary pub fare four times the price you ‘d expect in a pub.,"340 for 2 x cold roast lamb which took 1.5 hours to bring out plus wine ! Maybe worth 25 quid pp . Terrible experience, even for sg . Wine list is very limited. But it should be said is a nice looking venue"
Dedicated restaurant,Delicious food and nice environment! Super nice decorations and unique furnitures! Staff are friendly and the dishes they recommended are good to try out!
Disappointing attitude at this restaurant,"Let me keep this brief- we ordered the scotch eggs and was only told initially it contained quail eggs. later we find out it contains pork and my partner does not consume pork !!!

Fish & Chips - I now discover that the fries/chips are cooked in Beef fat and as per my religious beliefs i do not consume beef in any form.

MAYBE u could list these in the description on the menu & train your servers better to explain the ingredients -In Asia many people do not consume certain animal products because of their faith/belief/dietary restrictions etc.

Some sensitivity & respect please !!! Makes me sick knowing what i consumed.

Service was confused and substandard.

Food Was just average."
When did Mr White last taste the food? He wouldn't be happy!,"We ordered three roasts, all with different meats.

The meat quality and cookery was excellent, as was the Apple Crumble desert.

The other roast elements were awful - well below Mr White's standards. The roast potatoes were made with the wrong waxy type of potato, were under cooked and not crisp. The roast parsnip was rock-hard. The sautéed vegetables were under seasoned and bland. The Yorkshire pudding tasted of dry cardboard - this was the first time in my life I have not finished a Yorkshire pudding! And, the gravy was a watery, tasteless mess (the meats are not traditionally roasted, so the gravy didn't have sufficient roasting juices). Oh, and they wanted $S88++ for this disgrace.

Shame, as the ambience and staff were great."
Great experience,Jeannie and Vince were brilliant as usual. We come every month and it never fails. Great food and ambience. The staff are friendly and excellent
Good Food and Great Hospitality,"Decor is amazing with many articles alike to museum. Their manager, Winnie, is great in recommending food portion and Asian+Western combination, take away the hassle and allow us to focus on dining experience."
Sunday Roast,"Booked for 2 adults and 2 children. Empty restaurant but they sat us beside a larger table with screaming children when rest of the restaurant was empty.
Few choices for roast. Most items were not available. No childrens menu so paid $68 each for a roast lamb for each child.
Now know that they do have a childrens menu but when I asked our server he said no."
Will be back soon!,Having lunch today at the best restaurant in town they always gave me surprise with the new dishes like the one I love very much 鲍鱼面fantastic can't find anywhere in Singapore 👏👏👏thanks the chief's so much!
Perfect atmosphere for hosting,"Situated in the heart of Mohd Sultan, great atmosphere with cosy setting, perfect for business hosting, even for family & friends. Despite what the restaurant name, it serves not only authentic British menu, but they serve great Chinese menu as well. Perfect balance of East meet West <3

They serve delicious melt in your mouth London Smoked Duck (booking in advance is highly recommended to avoid disappointment), juicy fresh shrimp siew mai with foei gras (must try!), beer battered Fish n Chips is one of the best in Singapore too!

They serve east & west Sunday Roast Menu too."
Date Night,"We have been here before and was impressed. The last evening at this restaurant, I thought that the service was overwhelming, when myself and wife are trying to enjoy our company. The food was pretty average I have to say. Our main courses come out at different times, so we did not eat with each other and the vegetables that were ordered came out after our dinners. I did mention this to the waiter and I was told ""they only had one Chef on tonight and the person could not cook all the courses together. Unfortunately very poor for an expensive evening. Was a shame as we have had much better experiences. Would not be on my top list to visit again."
Great Breast and Cheeks,"Quaint space with great food. Great choices of English Classic and Hong Kong food.

Ordered the Roast English Duck Wellingtons and the Braised Cheek of Aberdeen Black Angus. The duck wellingtons was packed with generous pieces of duck breast that was still moist with the skin and fats. The puff was flaky and buttery. My favorite will be the beef cheek that melts in your mouth along with the creamy mash! Will come back here to try out its Sunday Roast soon!

Service was great and attentive."
Excellent Service and Food,"We were attended to by Farid and we went there for my brothers birthday lunch and it was lovely. We had the Beef wellington, suckling pig and the lobster dumpling. All of it were simply delicious. Farid made it extra special! Thank you."
Amazing hospitality and great food 🤩,"The ambience was nice and casual, nice decoration welcomed us in with a friendly host that led us in to our table. We sat down and was immediately attended by one of the friendly and funny waiter. We tried the fish maw superior soup first for starters while waiting for the ultimate beef wellington. We were very impressed at the balance of taste as well as the presentation. We were very full but was delighted to get a complementary dessert which was an amazing apple crumble for my husband’s birthday which was a big surprise for him:) thank you to the team for making this trip a memorable one"
Good Food and Nice Ambience,The food is excellent. Great Service Staff and Nice atmosphere Price is slightly expensive but is the worth the price.
Great Ambience and High Quality Fresh Food!,Had a lovely night out at this restaurant. The atmosphere is very welcoming and charming. The dishes were delicious from start to finish. The waitress was friendly and made great recommendations. Looking forward to visit again soon.
Fantastic,One of the best restaurant with the best service and the food is unforgettable! Definitely a MUST Try and we are definitely going back again. We are already missing the food the next day!
Loved this place,"Visited during my CNY visit. It is a Western restaurant and I was surprised they have some Chinese dishes so I ordered some dim sum and crispy skin roast duck. With no regret, the food was so tasty, yummy. I enjoyed every single bite of it. Couldn’t wait to pay a visit again."
Best CNY Lou Hei !!,"Another superb meal at the English House! Came for cny menu, the lou hei is different from many place, the ingredients are very fresh, they used bengkuang instead of white radish which elevates the vegetable crunch! We enjoyed it alot.

Foei Gras siew mai was fresh & yummy as always! Fish & Chips batter is light & crisp, gotten very good feedback from my guests. Thumbs up!

Highly recommended"
