Good Food,Went there to celebrate my wife's birthday. We ordered a sharing platter for 2 with some sides. Food was decent although we were surprised it's pretty quiet while the restaurant beside was bustling (same owner). It's probably because it does not have its own entrance and you have to walk through Prive to come in
Christmas Eve dinner,"Nice ambience, service staff is good and food is pretty good. Best time to be there is early evening for a nice view of the marina. Dog friendly establishment, saw some doggies there."
amazing experience!,"amazing food, ambiance and service! family friendly but also romantic! best outdoor place to eat at!"
Very disappointing food,"Booked this place for a birthday celebration. Ordered the chef's seafood platter. Quality of the food is terrible, especially the fried items like calamari and onion rings. Serious lack in standard."
Birthday Celebration,"Had a birthday dinner there - great views (can be very romantic), delicious food (the sharing platter is suitable for big groups) and the happy hour rate for some of the drinks was a good deal.

As it was a birthday celebration, the staff prepared a candle for our dessert and they took a polaroid shot for our group. And later, inserted the photo into a card, where the staff all signed off with lovely greetings. This very unexpected and lovely gesture was most heartwarming."
Food and ambiance,Perfect for meeting friends or a romantic dinner. The food is really good but expect to wait. The restaurant faces the marina. So the atmosphere is really nice.
"Disappointing, especially when compare to our last visit!","Was there with 5-yr-old and spouse Sunday evening, around 6pm. Restaurant about half-filled (all sat outdoors), indoors empty. Weather wasn't that humid, so we sat outside.

Table had a couple of stains on my side, son's seat had crumbs.

Seafood platter for 2 took at least 25 minutes to arrive. Portion is significantly less than the last we remember (about 2-3 yrs ago). First thing that we remember most clearly is that we used to have so much more seafood stock, this one came, and I had to peer into the pan to see some stock. Everything was still tender and tasty, except the fish. Fish was rubbery and dry, and we only saw few pieces of it at the bottom of the pan.

Maybe 5 min later, the kid's dish came, after I checked with staff. The broccoli stem was definitely hard, florets had some crunch. Earlier, staff told us broc was steamed when I asked. The chicken clearly was mostly breast - again, earlier staff told us portion would be thigh. I turned it (it came skin-side up), cut out a strip of breast - dry, slathered with some sauce that tasted sweet (bbq?). Mash on the side was good, not more than 2 tbsp of it served.

I also noticed beer-battered fish and deep-fried calamari on the kids menu (personal preference I understand, and for me I was a bit surprised).

I hardly ate and was hungry after the meal ($70++ for the platter meant for 2), and kids' dish was around $10. We finished everything we ordered. The previous time we went, I recall we struggled to finish, and we haven't changed our eating habits, etc. though we had a younger child then who ate a bit less.

The last thing I vividly recall was service. 1st time we went, staff went around to check on how we were doing, ensured food was to our expectations, etc. The 2nd visit, we observed signs of slipping standards (e.g. water not topped up, getting kids' menu wrong, not having staff deployed properly to stations, kitchen might not be coping, etc.)

I wanted to ask what fish it was that we were served (a restaurant that claims to specialise in seafood), but I did not have the confidence to ask after the dinner experience.

Still I must say, one of the most tender squid I have is at Bayswater! And the stock is delicious, really wished we could be given more to go with the food proportions!"
Relaxing dinner at Keppel Bayswater,"Order the mussels & clams, linguine vongole, seafood feast… and a bottle of white wine. Everything tasted superb. The seafood was fresh n flavorful. Will definitely recommend."
Memorable Birthday,Lovely pink sunset; Great company Windy fans blowing Nice staff served 2 birthday cake slices for our birthdays! But the barramundi was slow; Fish of the Fish & Chips was tough!
Lovely dinner,Expectations exceed with awesome food & service. Cauliflower side dish was big portion for 2-3 pax. Have a good experience and scenery.
friendly staff and good experience,"food was good , ribeye cooked just nice . fish and chip portion was LARGE 2 piece of fish and ton of fries. service staff was marvelous , was given a complementary dessert due to my birthday."
Excellent atmosphere and food,Very nice food and atmosphere. The seafood is so fresh . The pasta cook perfectly . Oyster is so freshly shucked. The platter portion was just nice for 2 pax. Chef and Service staff was friendly .
Food's taste seriously needs improvement. Cauliflower soup was unedible because was so salty. Waiters are very lovely.,Food's taste seriously needs improvement. Cauliflower soup was unedible because was so salty and creamy and couldn't taste the cauliflower at all. Waiters are very lovely.
The worst food I have had in 2 years.,"Scallops were cardboard. Octopus was an old tire. Kale was a soggy salty rag. One of the few times I have paid in full only to leave all the dishes on the plates and leave. The staff were at least nice and the view was very pretty. Could likely be OK as long as you order just a beer and the clam bucket. There is no chef, just a hack."
Excellent experience and good food,"Arrived just as the restaurant opened for lunch. Staff made us feel v welcomed and took care to note and follow up our requests.

Fish and Chips was a winner for me. Good portion of two pieces of battered fish and fries. Definitely will be back to try the other dishes soon!"
Poor service a major disappointment,"Great ambience. Good food.
2 senior waiting staff good.
Junior waiting staff very poor - had to constantly wave hands in air and shout to get some attention, so bad that I had to go to bar counter several times just to get service (ask for menu, ask for drinks, request table to be cleared) and when I looked for staff they were on mobile phone never looking up so no wonder I couldn’t get any service or attention; unfortunately really detracted from my wife’s birthday celebration; we looked forward to the evening for a few weeks but the poor service was a complete let down and the meal wasn’t worth the money - I paid 4 star prices for 1 star service.
The birthday photo and card at end was a nice touch."
Great ambience,The ambience was great! Happy it was pet friendly. Food was alright but service was nice! Got a lovely card with handwritten well wishes from the crew! Made me and my family feel very blessed.
Great Atmosphere,Our third time there and although the staff have almost completely changed the restaurant still remains very good with high quality seafood and great service.
Superb,"Was running late and called to hold the table. Operator was very kind to change the reservation time.
When we arrived the service was prompt and staff was attentive though they were a little short-handed.
We had a birthday celebration and they gave us a 2 (not 1) complimentary dessert with a candle. Perhaps the staff overheard that one of our birthdays were also round the corner.
Overall very good experience and would definitely visit again!"
Bad service,"Booked several weeks ago to be told a week before the booking g, sorry don't come we booked a wedding. Very poor planning and communication. We will never know how good or bad the food is only the service."
Good food great ambience,This is a great place for a romantic night out or a celebration. I love the outdoor seating with the waterfront views - and the food’s good (especially the fisherman platters) . This time we came because it was a family birthday celebration - and we were pleasantly surprised by the birthday dessert and the birthday card with handwritten greetings from the staff. Thank you Bayswater Kitchen!
The restaurant need renovation,"The table and chair at outdoor are old and dirty. Noticed a lot of spider web on the wooden tables, cushion dirty, dirty drinking glass. The fish not fresh too."
Very good service n environment,Not only we had a good birthday meal for my hubby. My 2 year old also had lots of fun before n after yummy feast.. the mini playgroup kept her busy while hubby and me can relax n enjoy the scenery n dinner. Staff were fantastic and thanks guys for the compliment birthday cake arrangement! We will certainly be back!
Disappointing Visit,"Food and service (especially service) has changed for the worse vs. pre-covid times. The Fisherman's Feast, which I was really looking forward to and had tried previously, was served lukewarm and despite adding one more portion they only topped up the linguine... I'd rather go to the neighbouring Prive for better quality food and service."
Valentine’s day set dinner,"Had a 6 course over a duration of 3 hours. The best part about this meal was the vday theme questionnaire that they provided to help us past the time in between courses (at least 30 mins between each course)

Only acceptable thing was the dessert. Oyster does not seem fresh, pumpkin soup too grainy, steak too dry and severely understaffed."
Family CNY gathering,"Good environment, food tasted good. Excellent service staff (2 of them) except for the reception lady who was cold & very unfriendly and avoided contact with customers. Not sure if she is the owner of the Restaurant group."
Very basic food with a high price tag,"Well, this outlet charges premium prices for a cafeteria quality type of food. No value for many at all. Main reason most probably is it’s location with the super high rental and the subsequent cost saving on food, personnel and service level... we waited for 20-25 minutes just to get initial drinks order. With almost no people around. Pretty sad."
What a horrible meal,"We were not informed that there was only set meals on NYE. The price was ridiculous for the poor food we paid for. Service was mediocre at best. They forgot to ask us how we want our steak to be cooked. It wasn't even well done, it was congratulations. We would have wanted it medium rare."
Wont be back again,"Had my New Year Eve dinner at Bayswater, and food standard was bow average
1. Oyster was not chilled
2. Mini crab cake and soup were served cold
3. Angel hair pasta was nothing great
4. Medium-well Ribeye steak was cooked as medium
5. Dessert was nothing great
6.Overall food presentation was bad
Wont be back again."
Great place to chill & feast,"Friendly staff, prompt service & excellent ambience! Food was delicious and of good quality. Loved the view and relaxing mood"
So-so,"Food and drinks were really good and tasty, but took so long to be served on our table. We also followed up the drinks order even if it’s just soft drinks. We understand that the restaurant was really under staffed, but for this holiday season, their management should really focus on food and service. For a full house dinner, we can see 2-3 servers. The bartender even needed to step out on the floor to take orders, clear tables and serve food and his drinks to the guests."
Office Christmas Luncheon,"It was a bit sad… the restaurant was at most at 70% capacity but they were still understaffed and service was really really slow. Of our table of 5, 4 of us had ordered the Pimms Lemonade and 1 of us - our boss, had ordered the non-alcoholic Lemonade and it seemed that it contained traces of alcohol as he went back home feeling flushed for the next 4 hours and felt very uneasy. It took us 10 minutes with the floor staff to confirm whether or not the beverage did include alcohol and they said it did not, so it’s a bit strange. In addition, the vegan main option in the set lunch menu (Cauliflower Steak), was abysmal as it was just raw cauliflower... Really doesn’t qualify as vegan which was why we picked this place as it supposedly offered a variety of vegan and vegetarian food. It was quite a disappointing experience for my colleagues and I to say the least. The only compensating factor was the great view. But even then.."
Great Service and Food!,The food was great and the portions were sufficient even for the kid’s meal. It was great value as we had 2 mains and the kid’s meal was free. It was a celebration dinner for my wife and they had provided a nice little chocolate cake with a scoop of icecream. They took a Polaroid photo of us and put it into a birthday card that was signed by several staff members. Very nice and memorable gesture from them!
Marina jazzy vibe,Great ambiance and food. Outdoor seating recommended! Whole red snapper is the best! Relaxed atmosphere. Ooooooooooooooi
Pet friendly al fresco dining,Wonderful dinner in the open with a sea breeze. Loved the seafood and the chill ambience! Our furbaby also loved chilling out in this lovely space.
A great dinner experience,We liked the ambience and food quality. But it was also the service provided by the staff (apologies for not knowing his name) that made the whole experience even better. The gentleman serving us made us felt very welcomed right from the start. We were there to celebrate our helper’s birthday and he made an effort to engage her in small talks and banters. He doesn’t need to do that but he did. He was also very attentive to our dog making sure he’s not left out by bringing him water and treats. We really loved how a simple birthday dinner turned out to be so nice and warmth. We had certainly chosen the right place.
"Good Food, Excellent Service","Kids & pets friendly restaurant. Had a birthday celebration, not only did we receive a complimentary dessert, the staff took a polaroid photo and gave us a card filled with handwritten well wishes from all the staff. The kids love the place so much that they requested to go back again soon."
Sunday Brunch,"Cosy corner seat for us and our XL dog! Welcome dish came with water bowl and kibbles.

Kaffee enjoyed the hot afternoon next to the aircon dining area, good enough!

Amazing deserts make sure you leave space for them, eat less bread/fries/potatoes/pasta, even the fish and chips came with a big plate of chonky fries. Hahahha."
Sunday Brunch,Second Time to go here with our pet dog. Everything was such a breeze. The Sunday Brunch is fantastic and the staff very friendly even to our pet. Ambiance is perfect. We will sure be back soon.
"Lovely atmosphere, good food, great service.","Personalised and attentive service. The view just transported me to another place. I enjoyed the food. All in all it was a lovely evening out. If you don’t like dogs/pets, this is not the place for you."
Nice food with good ambience,"The food is nice especially the grill fish and pot of mussels, really umami. The ambience is great, facing the keppel bay with lots of yacht. The staff provide good customer service and very attentive to the needs of the customer, especially Brandon and Teen. A real nice serene place out of the hustle bustle town."
Enjoyable experience,"Enjoyed their seafood stew and seafood pasta. But what stands out is the ambience… Keppel bay is peaceful at night, so it was relaxing to dine"
Excellent place for waterfront dining and superb food!,"Had a great evening tonight, thanks to the superb food and friendly, attentive staff at Bayswater. We tried the Seafood platter for 2 and it was awesome - grilled to near perfection! Its definitely a good place for anyone whos looking for a good time."
Best place to chill,"Food , service & ambience was excellence ! So relaxing , will be back again for sure ! They even wrote a birthday card with a Polaroid photos of us for my friend , she was very touched by the gesture ! Thumbs up for the great service"
Excellent Evening!,"I like the ambience, surrounding and most importantly the food. One of the few places in singapore that serve whole fish. Will return"
Beautiful Ambience and Tasty Food,"It was difficult to find the entrance as you had to walk in via the busy Privé, but once you’re in Bayswater Kitchen, you feel the relaxing atmosphere.. The food is great! Trout Carpaccio is a MUST. And my dog had a seat on the sofa! Definitely coming back again!"
Excellent place to dine with pet,Friendly and helpful staff. Their food recommendations always meet expectations too. Pets are welcome. It has become our favourtie place to dine and have a walk after.
Great staff and food,And also pet friendly with a lovely view over the marina! Decent prices for Singapore and very friendly staff!
Birthday Celeb at Bayswater Kitchen,"We had a fun night celebrating my birthday on 17 July. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food portions were biga and food was good. We chose to seat outdoor and the ambience is so chill. What made our visit so special was the complimentary dessert for me, plus a polaroid and a birthday card. Thank you so much Bayswater Kitchen staff. Keep it up."
5 stars to ambiance and service,"Had been here today to celebrate my husbands bday. Great view and ambiance. The staffs are sooo Soo friendly and warm . They celebrated with us with cake and even took a photo and gave a very touching bday card with all staffs personalized message.
Thank you so much for hosting us. Will visit again for sure ❤️"
Very tasty and great service,"A very soothing harbourfront setting with good food, great and friendly service at reasonable prices"
Lovely View with wonderful food and service,"We celebrated Mother’s Day here with our 4 children and booked and evening outdoor seat. Wonderful views at Keppel Bay, and the kids had fun exploring while waiting for food. There’s even a playground, and a full sized Foosball and Ping Pong table inside.

Service was excellent, food was delicious, and we had an unexpected surprise of a Mother’s Day card and Polaroid with complimentary desert! Kids and parents both happy and satisfied :)"
"Fresh air, million $ views and great service with yummy food and wine","We sat at a table overlooking Keppel Bay Marina, with its multi-million dollar boats at our feet, a huge fan blowing cool air, sipping chilled beer and Rosè and enjoying the great playlist. The food came and there's no going back from the truffle mac and cheese! Your tastebuds can't forget it. Adding the octopus and cauliflower with a side of hand-cut chips, it was just enough for 3. Service was fast and attentive, comfy chairs and a chilled vibe will have us going back again soon. Biggest bonus - we could take the dog too (but do book in advance as dog tables are limited ."
Overpriced food and average service,"Nice ambience with a playground for the kids. Can get abit too hot in afternoon for lunch. The food is overpriced, given the quality of it. The variety of the food menu is rather limited too."
BAYSWATER KITCHEN,"Reservation on Chope was fast, accurate and easy. Highly recommended. Wish to received promotions from Chope"
ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED! We,"ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED!

We had a lovely time at Bayswater Kitchen! Brought our dog as well and was given a shaded area with fans blowing in our direction so it wasn't too hot.

The food was AMAZING and the Shellfish Bisque is to die for!!! It was so good we ordered twice! The oysters were fresh and the steak was juicy and absolutely mouthwatering!! The dessert was very yummy but was too much chocolate for our liking.

We loved the amazing views and the waiters were all so friendly and attentive! Even had some fun with our dog haha!

One feedback I would give is that it is better to make the entrance to Bayswater Kitchen larger as we stood in queue to Prive for quite a bit before being told that Bayswater was inside of Prive."
"Unpretentious great food, warm & superb service - is the package you can expect at Bayswater Kitchen","Met up with my classmates from 1975 for an ordinary evening get-together but was treated to an extraordinary dining experience. If the weather permits, alfresco dining is the way to go - but wherever you choose to sit, be prepared for an outstanding meal. Thank you very much Bob & Chef Roland : every ounce of your kind effort is deeply appreciated on the evening of 24th March 2021. Truly 5*Stars !!"
Not great,"Food was more miss than hit. Seafood platter had mussels which were 'unbearded' and the team did nothing to compensate us when I showed them this. Calamari was stringy and hard to eat, so we didnt even touch it. Sauces that came with the platter- no one told us what they were, and they just tasted odd and did not fit in with the meal. The only thing I could really stomach were the prawns, but paying $90 for 3 prawns is a bit over the top. Lobster bisque was runny and a bit flavourless. Soft shell crab burger had a soggy crab with little flavour. Fish and chips, the fish's batter was way too think, and the fish itself had little flavour.

The staff looked like they'd rather be elsewhere too. Little explanation of what we were eating (see sauce comment above) and no apology for bearded mussels (inedible). I saw one of them break a glass at a nearby table and they just started sweeping at the feet of the customers without telling them and moving their chairs (which they were still sitting on!) without any warning. Staff just had this constant look of anger and pain on their faces- im sorry but no one forced you to be there."
Very Bland,"Bought a platter for 90 bucks and it was really small with only a few class and cockles. Not only that, it was cold, the linguine was hard, two tiny pieces of fish (of which one was inedible because it wasn't chewable) and the broth was really bland. Don't really have an exquisite taste but this has been one of the worse meals I had in my life for that price."
Just for the ambience,"Nice and lovely ambience for date night. However, food is expensive and very mediocre. Please don't order fisherman's feast as its just an over priced 70 bucks seafood pasta... Was surprised when the dish arrived because for such a price tag, the presentation and taste was disappointing (seafood were not fresh which is ironic as they pride themselves to be a fresh seafood restaurant). Ribeye was quite tough and not worth it's price. Food portion was quite small too. For 4pax we ordered fisherman's feast (2pax), ribeye steak, whole red snapper, fish and chips, dozen oysters, truffle mac & cheese and mussels and clams in a pot to be full."
Birthday celebration,"I was delighted that the restaurant offered a complimentary dessert for my friend who's celebrating his birthday. Very friendly staff there and they were attentive. When we felt too warm sitting outside, they swiftly got us a table indoor. Food was good, sauces were fantastic, happy hours prices of wine we had were great. The only thing is de oysters... when I shared de photos with my friends via groupchat of the good times we were having here, they said the oysters had gone on a diet before they got to de table! haha. Oh well they were indeed 'thin'. Maybe the menu can have more items?"
I will NEVER go back again,I will NEVER go back again if the same restaurant manager is there.. NO customer service and way too arrogant .. He called his staff servant !
"Personal touch, fresh seafood, great view!",Came to celebrate my friend’s birthday. They took note of my request when I made reservations and indeed gave us a superb view with no blockage. The seafood was fresh. Fries were quite hard but maybe we were outdoors so got cold. They even gave us a complimentary brownie and Polaroid shot! With a written nice birthday card signed by a few! My friend was touched by their gesture!
set lunch,"For our walk at Labrador Nature and Coastal Walk and Bukit Chermin Boardwalk, this restaurant was a good rest stop for lunch. It was not crowded during weekday. We had the two course set lunch at $28++ with either a choice of appetiser and a main or a main and dessert. My crab bruschetta tasted delicious but we were quite disappointed with the red snapper main. It was quite salty.
We were thankful that there is a shuttle service to the Harbourfront MRT station at 1 pm . There are a few later timings too. We also like the ambience in the casual restaurant."
great business lunch,"nice lunch menu with enough food choice, great quality, nice location at the Marina and friendly service"
"Great ambience, good food, and stellar service","Visited Bayswater for dinner recently - we found the food delicious and reasonably priced, the ambience relaxing, and the service to be stellar - thanks to Tim and the Bayswater team for making our visit a pleasant one!

Your team's attentiveness to our needs and willingness to provide service which goes the extra mile is truly what made our visit a memorable and enjoyable one."
Excellent service staff,"I enjoyed the relax atmosphere offered by Bayswater Kitchen despite that the restaurant was crowded and yet understaffed. There was one runner, 1 bartender, 2 floor staff and 2 managers.
Despite that we need to ask the floor staff to check on our orders, more than twice, the staff were attentive and work very hard in ensuring that the patrons got their drinks, food, taking orders after orders and ushering patrons in. I would love to commend on the manager, Bob and one of the floor staff (young petite lady with ponytail). Both were super apologetic whenever they missed out on our food.
I would like to point out on how attentive Bob was when he came to our table with our Seared Hanging Tender. As he was serving the item and repeating the order, “Seared Hanging Tender – Medium Rare and Seared Hanging Tender - Medium Well”, he stopped from serving me the Medium Well meat and apologised before taking it back. He had noticed that the meat wasn’t done as per request.
Overall, I had enjoyed the food, atmosphere, reasonable prices and the service there. Would love to come again at nighttime for a different experience."
Horrible food but great view,Clams were out of stock. And most of the sea food dishes had clams in them. Also staff kept trying to take our food even though we were in middle of eating them.
Birthday,"Service was perfection! Truly enjoyed the experience. They even went ahead to give us a free cake, Polaroid picture and even a handwritten birthday card! The view was amazing as they provided a great seating arrangement for us as requested. Very fast response. Definitely recommend."
Birthday celebration,It was a birthday celebration. Appreciate that the restaurant actually make an effort to take a polaroid photo for us and also the birthday card! Staff services was great.
Poor experience. Never coming back again.,"I visited Bayswater for Valentine's day and had such a poor experience. I ordered from the multiple course special menu available for V-day. The service was horrible. We waited so long (>20mins) in between every course and had to remind the server after every single course. We also ordered a serving of fries at the start of the meal, had to remind them almost 4 times that we had fries that weren't served and even by the time we finished our main course just before dessert, we still hadn't seen the fries. We cancelled it and when the bill came, they included it in and we had to remind them that it was cancelled.

Only saving grace was that the ambience was nice."
Dinner for 2,"The food was great, atmosphere was awesome with dedicated service crews that help to prepare some birthday surprises for my girlfriend. Definitely recommended for the food and ambience. ....."
Valentines dinner,"Nice environment.
Order oyster, pasta, steak and dessert. The oyster is fresh but the chef left many shell in the oyster.
The pasta is not fully cook and left much water in the plant
I request the steak to be well done. It, however, became a medium raw."
Valentine's Day Lunch,"Environment is nice facing the Keppel Marina. As I am a service provider myself, the service rendered by Bayswater Kitchen is great. We had the brunch buffet along with free flow drinks and the service was prompt."
bad experience,"We went for the weekend brunch buffet, nice selection of food. We arrived at 12 noon, restaurant doesn't look too busy, however we waited an hour before our 1st order start to arrive.

Requested to expedite order, feedback to manager name Bob ""if the restaurant cannot handle the orders, should let us know, we wouldn't go for the buffet"" I am shocked he retorted ""the kitchen cannot handle but I can handle""

Unfortunately we are here for the food not for Mr Bob. Bad experience with Bob but rest of service crew is fantastic. Lastly food is mediocre at best"
Birthday Celebration,"Went on July 2020 for my birthday and had the Fisherman Feast, was satisfied by their freshly of the seafood. Decided to go again for my wife’s birthday this time round, and we ordered the seafood platter, it never failed us!
Thou they never sell birthday cake however, still managed to get me a candle on my dessert. Staff oso took a photo of us and attached to a birthday card with their well wishes. Thanks!"
I came with an $80 coupon and I still felt like it was a waste of money.,"Ordered Shellfish Bisque (Very good!), Mussels and Clams in a Pot (Overcooked and not nice flavor), Truffle Mac & Cheese (gummy texture), Roasted Barramundi (OK), Fish & Chips ( Good), and the Fisherman's Feast (Absolutely terrible, dry, overcooked, way too much badly cooked pasta, weak flavor/no taste). In short, not enough good food to get me to come back.

We ate outdoors, and that was an OK experience. The waitstaff was stressed out as the restaurant was full that evening."
Great restaurant at the bay,"We love the Bayswater kitchen. Great ambiance, food, atmosphere, staff. Highly recommended for any occasion 🥰"
Everything was perfect❤️,"Celebrated our anniversary here and From
The food (we ordered the rib eye steak, prawns and even cater our requests not in the menu) to the ambience, view, music and service its excellent. The team made our day so special. Surprised us with a complimentary anniversary desert cake , took a nice photo and a card with the photo on it and all the staff write their well wishes for us. We will definitely comeback and bring our friends and family❤️"
Pricey for a brunch buffet,"The food was great but the price for the brunch buffet was not worth it considering a only a few choices and a some items were not available on that day. Service is great. So except for the price, it was overall an okay dining experience."
"Good food, nice ambient, but room for improvement for service","Three of us went for the weekend dinner gathering. We were left standing at the entrance, where all of the staff pretended they did not see us until we waved at them to show our existence!

When asked about the menu and more details, the staff could not give a clear explanation and description; only kept on emphasizing 'the set menu is not available on weekend', which we are well aware of!

However, we did enjoy our meal very much. The food is good, and delicious! Ambient is nice for friends gathering and lovely dining atmosphere.

I would give the restaurant a full 5 stars, but discount a bit because of the 'not so friendly' experience we have had encountered upon our arrival at the restaurant!"
Slow service. Not efficient but friendly staff.,"Visited on New Year’s Eve. Service was slow and had to wait close to 30min between each course. Staff seemed to be only interested in their own tasks. So if you asked someone for the bill, you won’t get it. Neither will they pass on the message to the right person. Had to ask 3 times before I got the bill. Staff were generally friendly and nice, just that they are not very efficient. Perhaps it was the festive season."
Awesome Ambience & Staff!,"We were there on 2 Jan 2021, brought my wife there to celebrate her birthday. The place has a beautiful lovely ambience! Really nice. The service staff were really helpful and attentive as well. They made sure that we were well taken care of. Mika from the restaurant was really sweet in ensuring all of that and also pre preparing a sweet birthday dessert/cake for my wife. My wife loved it and we will come back for sure in the future!"
A five ⭐️ family gathering,"A dinner that turned out to be soooo warm-hearted because I was with someone I’ve always admired and she was there with her kids whom I could just click and connect easily. It was a memorable meal that started off with kids meal of chicken and fish & chips (both very little) but the ala carte bowl of fries was addictive and lasted till the end of our meal. In between, I had mushroom risotto and she had olio olio; both vegetarian (nice but very little portion)!

We then started on a rampage of desserts; 2 types of chocolates and then mango & passion fruit and a panna cotta with strawberries that was extremely Sour but also nice! The environment is cosy and very suitable for couples as well as families. And at the end of our meal, we went for a short walk along the side of the pier enjoying the lightings and yacht berthed by the side of the bay! An enjoyable meal made sweet with the landscape and people I love ❤️!

A & S forever...."
Pretty poor,Best thing on the menu was the squid and they no longer serve grilled squid. Calamari was overdone with practically zero squid in it. Lobster roll was more prawns with 2 tiny pieces of lobster. White wine was cheap and not particularly good quality.
Go there for the ambience!,"It's a bit out of the way, but the food, ambience, and service made up for it all. The fairy lights at the outdoor dining area made the night extra magical, not to forget that we also saw double rainbows twice! Staff was attentive to our needs and had good knowledge on food choices. Food portion wise was just nice for us. I had the roasted barramundi and it was done to perfection - crispy skin, tender meat, no fishy smell. Seafood was fresh, though the grilled prawns might be a little too charred and I would prefer a crunchier prawn. The smoky taste makes it a good match with the wilted spinach and bed of mashed potato from the barramundi dish."
Presently Surprise with the Service and Food Quality,"My family decided to have our lunch over the Christmas Festive period at Baywater Kitchen because of the scenic harbour view right at the restaurant front. We took the $58/pax ala carte buffet on offer. We were glad that the serving for the main courses were smaller than the usual serving (which is about right) thus allowing us to try on the wide varieties of food on offer, including Oysters (2pc/pax). The food was great. I was most please with their service standards especially Bob, the restaurant manager. The restaurant also provide complimentary Polaroid photo shot of my family and a personalised Christmas card. Thank you Baywater! Certainly will consider dinning there again."
Enjoy an evening of alfresco dining with a view of Sentosa,"Food is good and the pricing for the Christmas Set Dinner is worth it. Nice ambient, seats are comfortable and service is good, except for one service staff who seems a little indifferent."
Great Sunday Brunch,Great food with a good choice for both adults and children. Service was attentive and overall a very pleasant and relaxing meal.
late for food,was late for the reservation due to: our yacht charter was running alittle late due to the weather and it was our first visit there and we went to the wrong restaurant. but the staff were accommodating to let us in and reminded us the time of closure. we appreciate the kind gesture. thank you!

Wonderful dinner at Bayswater Kitchen,Had son's birthday dinner with family there. Excellent food and service. Highly recommended.. 👍🏼👍🏼
Yummy seafood with great ambience !,"Came for first time, food quality is relatively good but not wow! Ordered a seafood platter and taste like a typical bbq food. However it comes with lots of dipping sauce for you to try. Ordered the ribeye steak and not too bad. The oyster is small but tasty ! The wine is unique with lots of choices . Tried the Good Company Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand was really good. The dessert was fantastic but forgot to take the picture.. the bitter chocolate cake with ice cream. The service is excellent by the waiter Tim as he always there to try to help and serve you despite disappointment for not able to get the outdoor sitting even there is empty seat. However Tim was so helpful to know I have requested it earlier. But after the meal, kind of late to go out and chill.. he is awesome !"
Definitely worth a second visit!,"First time over hear with my family and pet dog. Reservation was made through phone call and customer service was really good! They even provide a water bowl for my pet dog.
Food-wise, we ordered the Fisherman’s platter and it was of quality. Linguine was cooked al-dente, not overcooked nor undercooked! Seafood was fresh and tasty as well. Cocktail selection was just about right.
Would come here for another visit again for the ambience and scenery, and of course, drinks and food :)"
Good food and great service,"Had a lovely time celebrating a friends birthday. Staff went above and beyond to look after us. Food was excellent, great value for the set lunch."
Go only for Desserts,"Seafood restaurant with horrible cod fish. As a fish lover, the fish was tough and tasteless, very difficult to eat. It was nauseating! The kale was bitter and definitely not a crispy dish as the name suggest. It was just a salty dish. The only plus point would be be dessert that was surprising nice, which compensated slightly for the bad main course. Overall a very disappointing experience and lunch."
First visit,Was surprised and impressed with the atmosphere and food(Mains). Don’t really fancy the starters and desserts.
Awesome as always!,We were here on a Friday evening. We have never been disappointed when we dine here. Bob and his team are so warm and super efficient in what they do. Jack and Roland in the kitchen are the best ever with their yummy food. AA rating all round !!
"Tip top seafood, great staff, and reasonable price",Went there with the missus for 5 year anniversary. Loved it. Food was awesome. Staff were really nice and even wrote us a card with a polaroid. They know what they are doing.
