Best of the Best Buffet in town.,"2nd visit within 3 weeks, Fri & Sat Seafood dinner. Recommend seafood first, beef dish of the night, other meat & veggies selections and lastly dessert in that order. Menu-8 pages so must strategize choice of food bcos I can never ever finish trying all even if I eat a piece of each dish.
Service was excellent throughout. Let me start with Loges who showed us to our seats. Very polite and she had a great smile I felt like I had 2 personal servers (Mr. Abishek and Mr. Rahul). They were so attentive without being intrusive. Mr. Abishek was super observant. He noticed I was struggling to get a wet tissue out of my small purse and immediately brought over wet wipes & serviettes (wow!). Our plates were cleared as soon as we were done (impressed cos I like my plate cleared asap). Even management staff, Mr. Rethish and Mr. Alfian came by to engage with us and offer selections to try. Chef Ye Siong was helpful & accommodating to my request at the sashimi counter. Even Chef Benton came by to say hello because I last met him 3 weeks ago. Colony has the most extensive Quality selections in their buffet in town compared to the other hotels. Most importantly, it is the Service Excellence that enhance an awesome dining experience that finds me coming back time and again. The fact that their Management staff (not 1 but 3) popped by last night to engage guests is something I hardly find in the other establishments. Highly recommended but be warned, you need to make reservations at least 2 to 3 months ahead. Check out the extensive menu from their website. I am not able to upload all 8 pages."
Dinner Buffet,"Well greeted by the staff, Ajay was very polite and helpful to assist us as well mr Raj, Ajay provide above beyond service coming to check on us if we need any drinks. nice ambience and the buffet food üòãüëç"
As Good As Ever,"Returned to Singapore and visited Colony after 3 years for its fabulous lunch buffet. The food was just as good if not better- especially the laksa with fresh cockles. Decor was just as I remembered, bright yet warm. Service was outstanding as usual.

Chef Nicolas remembered the Char Kway Teow that I loved, with extra crispy pork fats. Lee Lee and Tessa were just as attentive as before.

This is the place to go to if one misses all the local Singapore food. It is understandable why Colony remains the best buffet restaurant in Singapore after all these years. Kudos to all working at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore and Colony."
Delicious and grateful,"Amazing food and amazing service. Serve by Ajay, Danial , Jane and Sundar. They were simple wonderfully , quick and attentive."
Great dinner,"Had our reunion dinner at colony. It was a fantastic experience, food was plentiful and the spread was one of the best I have seen in Singapore. To put the icing on the cake, we were well taken care off during the entire dinner. Never once, do we need to flag for the attention of the service staff despite it being full house.
I strongly recommend anyone to try out their buffet. Not cheap but definitely worth it"
Nice Dinner at Colony with our server Mayank,"We had decided on Colony for a celebration. Food was great, with a fantastic selection, one of the best, if not the best hotel buffet. Mayank was really attentive the whole night, providing us with great service. Would return :)"
Good,"Second time visiting here , food is so good and my friends like it so much , thx for the services and chef , there done the good job!"
Perfectly Wonderful!,"Was celebrating my BFF's birthday and we had an enjoyable lunch with sumptuous food quality, great ambience and great customer service by Hannah!"
Jan 2023,"We would like to complement zi Ling for her excellent service. She was super attentive and efficient, and went above and beyond to make sure we had a pleasant dining experience.
Small details like Making sure the water is always filled.
Appreciate the good service.

Family friendly place, ziling paid special attention to the little one needs. After meals, she prepared colouring books for the little ones to divert the attention, so that the adult can continue dining.

The food was delicious and super fresh, many variety to choose from as well. We will definitely be back in the near future."
Dinner,Wide variety of good quality food. Had to book 4 months in advance but maybe because it‚Äôs CNY period. Special mention to Abishek who took great care of us and even served us one of the desserts from the buffet. Wonderful service overall and it was a really enjoyable night! They cleared plates very fast and were very efficient ‚ó°Ãà
Excellent Service,"We would like complement Abhishek for his excellent service. He was attentive and efficient, and went above and beyond to make sure we had a pleasant dining experience. The food was delicious and presented beautifully. We will definitely be back!"
Kudos to Noelle !!,"After an excellent dining experience during Covid-control period in Oct 22, brought the family to dine at Colony again. But this time, with all the restrictions lifted, the help-yourself buffet is back and of cos the queues at the various stations eg. fresh seafood and sashimi are also back. However, service and assistance is still expected at hotels such as The Ritz Carlton. So, when we met the server Zi Ling, we were terribly disappointed and she almost spoiled our dinner.

Fortunately, we met Noelle, who was not even in charge of the section we were at, who came running to us when she noticed that we were looking around for help (to get a cup of coffee). After serving us the coffee, she even came back to check on us to ensure that we were well attended to.

Chef Richard also made our day; he took a request for an Aglio Olio Pasta (which was yummy) though it wasn't included in the spread. Additionally, when the Guava juice ran out, he made special arrangement for more to be made and then, personally served them to us !

Other than the good food that majority of Colony's diners rave about which we certainly agree especially on its freshness and quality, it's Thanks to Noelle, Chef Richard and Hannah who made our dining experience Excellent!!"
Good food and good service,Great place for family gathering. Cosy with nice food. Special mention to staff Abhishek for his great service. All staff were polite and professional. Thank you
Abhishek Excellent service!,"Visited for a company dinner. Was served by the server Abhishek, and we had a most enjoyable time. Dishes were cleared as soon as we were done, drinks, utensils and serviettes were served promptly, and Abhishek was always readily available to assist with all our requests. The food is delicious and has good variety. Highly recommend!"
Not too shabby..,"Great sitting, fantastic service from waiting staff and delicious food. Only drawback is its popularity, hence the numerous diners in the given space. A little too noisy and crammed in some corners."
Very good service & food,Service & food was well done. Thank you abhishek for the good service üòä I believe I will come back again
Great Buffet & Service,Abishek was a delight. Thanks for the experience. Abishek was a delight. Thanks for the experience..
Colony is very good! with Abhishek,"This is the first visit to Colony, and we are impression about the service and environments. we plan to come to here again in future. Thank you!"
Probably the best champagne brunch in Singapore.,"Probably the best champagne brunch in Singapore.

A great range of food to choose from and in depth too.

I love their laksa and wanton noodles and range of Indian dishes along with a great rage of seafood and extensive range of cheeses.

Our brunch was made by the amazing Chef Sundar who was as friendly and happy as ever and gave us wonderful special dishes.

The icing on the cake was Joy who ensured that the wonderful food was complemented by continuous full glasses of champagne. Always delivered with a smile too.

Exceptional service from Sundar and Joy especially.

Highly recommended."
Fantastic service as always.,"It's our second time here post covid and the service is fantastic as always. Special shout out to service crew Geraldine who was very attentive and provided great service.

The food is pretty delicious but in comparison to our dinner in Dec 2022, the lobsters today were not as fresh and the menu (although both were seafood dinner) did not include the baked salmon which we love as it's baked to perfection and almost literally melts in the mouth.

Regardless, we highly recommend Colony and would be back again."
Birthday Dinner,"Thanks for the good service crew Ms Noel, She recommended the Popiah Ice cream is super niceüëçüëçüëçüëç We are so enjoy the fresh food and the environment at here"
Best Customer Service of the day for Dale Khalel Loquillano,"Dale is very accomodating, friendly and was able to assist us from all our special request in a fastest way and with all the best he can. Without complain and willing to hear all our stories and feedback.
Because of that we gave him 101% and five star rating for his excellent service,

Thank you very much Dale!
You're doing great!
All the best.
We're going to return here because of him

Take Care

Marilyn Malubay"
Recommendation for Dale for amazing customer,"My friends and I had an amazing experience during our dinner dated 5 Jan 2023, Dale provided us great customer service. Will recommend Colony and will come back again!"
Wonderful dinner and hospitality at Colony,"Great food, great service, wonderful experience every single time we come.

Service staff by the name of Joy, notice that my mum was feeling cold thus she offered a small blanket. She also regularly fill up hot water for my mum. Very very good service.

Food selection were very wide and nice.

Thank you."
Brunch,Best brunch in Singapore! I have done a few but this was outstanding! Thank you for a lovely afternoon! Thank you especially to Abhishek and mason. Xx
Great brunch,Amazing food and amazing service. Abashek and Mason ‚Ä¶ great service. Much better than Fullerton Brunch. Highly recommend.
Indeed 5 star service!,"My family and I had lunch last Tuesday, and I would like to commend your staff, Hannah for her excellent and attentive service. She makes time to ask how our experience was even though it gets a little busy.

She even surprise our daughter with a birthday cake without even asking!

Seafood spread is great. Will come back again soon maybe for dinner because 2 hours is not enough to enjoy the wide selection of food.

Keep up the good work Colony!"
Excellent Service,"My wife brought me here for a birthday buffet dinner here at Colony. Overall ambient of the place is nice and well furnished. As for the food, there is alot of variety, from local Singaporean food to western cuisine. All are exceptionally good!

Service are top notch here. The Service Staff are very approachable and competent. After our dinner, she have requested for mini birthday cake to surprise me, it came very well decorated!

We would like to give special thanks to Mr. Abhisek, who provided us exceptional service and making our dining experience here so enjoyable."
Last buffet of the year,"Came here to celebrate my birthday. The place is quite crowded on Wednesday lunch.
Their birthday cake is yummy! Variety of food is great but sashimi only has 3 choices... the squid is not nice... the q for sashimi is quite long and the area is narrow.

Overall experience is great!"
My go-to place for a celebration. Great service and Very nice food üëåüèº,"Whenever we go to colony you guys made us feel valued, well taken care of and special. That is the reason why we keep on coming back. Special thanks to the part timers Ryan and Cai fang. They are the kind of staff that Ritz must value. I am a hotelier too and working in the same field. As a hotelier, I know and I feel who are those staff who enjoys what they are doing by the quality of service they are providing to the guests. I felt the sincerity and care of those staff mentioned above. Ryan was really polite whenever he check and attend our needs. I like how he interacts to us. I can see that he is really well educated with the words he is using whenever he speaks. Cai fang we never hear her speak but she has initiative. She knows what the guests needs by just observing. I was really impressed. Those kind of staff must value because they really take care of the guests. The sincerity is there. Those type of staff must treasure. They are rare to find. Anyway, thanks again.. We really enjoyed our wedding celebration by eating at colony. The food is really good. We'll definitely be back again. Thank you!"
Fantastic buffet spread and quality food,"Besides having a huge menu, every item we ate was good. This is exceptional when compared with previous buffets we had tried. I had always liked the look of the place and decided to bring my family there for a Christmas buffet after previous company functions at The Colony. I am glad I made the right decision"
Amazing dinner at Colony,"The Christmas food was wonderful and delicious. The service was amazing, thank you John especially for making our dinner date so wonderful and taking care of us. Excited to come back again."
Good food & service!,"The buffet spread was great, fresh and amazing! John was especially friendly and his service is truly the best."
Colony lunch,Ambience is good but the serving of topping up seafood is slow resulting in long queue. Being chase for payment and the excuses is there‚Äôs a lot of people.
Poor selection,"The menu for the festive buffet lunch was disappointing. Selection was limited. No oysters, lobster, or roast beef. Cheese snd dessert selection was poor too. What ever happened to the good old buffet before Covid?"
Dinner at Colony,"Great service & hospitality! Service was prompt n staffs were attentive. My kids love the food, tasty n served with finesse"
Amazing service,"Colony never fails in service standards. Superb attentive staff despite restaurant at full capacity.

My wife was not feeling too well that evening. Staff immediately came over to check on us followed with a pot of hot tea with honey and a shawl.

Constantly checking back on us making sure we are well taken care of.

We didn‚Äôt managed to get her name,(lady wearing specs).

Amazing job to the hostess who got us a seat in minutes despite long que.

Thank you Colony for the comfortable and memorable evening!

Lastly, Food was AMAZING as always.

Keep up the great work team!"
"Excellent service, food, and ambience!","We had breakfast at Colony (4th December 2022) and were met with amazing service from the staff (special thanks to John who was so pleasant and made sure we were comfortable the whole time we were there!)

The atmosphere/ambience/layout of the restaurant was also amazing, with each 'little island' featuring different types of cuisine/food (Indian, Western, Chinese, Japanese, Cereals, Salad, Fruit, Dessert). There was such a wide selection of food (and drinks ‚Äì love the little masala tea station!); it was so great to get a little taste of everything!

Thoroughly enjoyed our time at Colony, would definitely be back again :-)"
Lovely dinner at Colony with good quality n variety of buffet spread,"Always love dining at Colony. The staffs are friendly, helpful and attentive. We had a very good dinner on 1st Dec 2022 celebrating my friend's bday. The buffet spread was excellent n quality of food was really good.
Special thanks to Alfian Haidzer, the restaurant manager for his hospitality and he was so friendly n approachable. Keep up the good work and we shall br back for sure."
Best best best champagne brunch in town. Can‚Äôt miss,"Food is excellent. You simply can‚Äôt taste all of them just because it‚Äôs just too many variety.
What I can tell about the service. You just can‚Äôt find better elsewhere.
The only issue is my 2 daughters are having sugar high. Need to find a way to control them next time.
For sure will come back"
Excellent Meal and Service,"Celebrated my birthday in this restaurant. The food was superb. The service of the staff was beyond any expectation and I enjoyed my time thoroughly here.

Special thanks to Eric, Shiyin, Kuang Hwa, Chef Zheng Wei and Lee Lee for making my special occasion a memorable and meaningful one.

Highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely visit again!"
Colony Restaurant,Variety of food is awesome. Just that the crabs are too salty. Colony Laska is not spicy enough. The atmosphere is really great and the service is good.
Good food but service could be more personal,"I went there with my family members recently. Food is good. We did enjoy ourselves very much. When i make the reservation, I have indicated for birthday celebration. However, when we asked the staff for birthday cake and candles, we were only given candle, no cake, after many times checking. That's disappointing for a restaurant of such high standard. What's worse is other table was given cake for their birthday celebration."
Our meals is meaningful and satisfying.,"My wife and I was well serve by Ms Esther Kwong, one of the many waitresses
She serve willingly, cheerfully and been pro-active.
She even recommend a few of the excellent cuisine to us to try.
Because of her service, we will return next year and recommend some of my buddy to come along.
Thank you Esther for your excellent service.
You make us feel at home."
Compliments for James and Rezky,"I would like to give my compliments to James (attended to our table) and Rezky (pasta station) for their outstanding services rendered.

James is super meticulous and attentive and went beyond his duties to ensure we had the most pleasant dining experience. One of the things he did - Upon knowing that I wouldn't have time to take the desserts, he actually made the efforts to take all the desserts for me to try, which was to my utmost pleasant surprise.

Rezky accommodated to all my requests for the pasta and even checked back with me if my requests were all met.

Kudos to both of them and their attitude brought my experience at Colony to another level."
Best dining environment with fantastic service,Brought my wife to colony for her birthday dinner and the dining experience with no exception was top notch and special thanks to Mayank for his keen attention to our dining needs and the booking staff that arranges the birthday surprise for us. Thank you.
Lovely lunch at a lovely place,"We had the buffet lunch yesterday. It was really very good all round, from the good quality and fresh food, great service from all staff, to the nice decor and ambience. Will return for sure."
Afternoon tea,"Lovely place and the staff were very attentive.
What I don‚Äôt like is the method of serving all the food in oversized heavy bowls. They are so large they get stacked on top of each other taking up so much space. Some bowls had such a small amount of food in it was garnished with stones. What is wrong with the traditional and far more practical cake stand? The bowls reminded me of dog bowls or takeaway containers. Madness!"
Great Champagne Brunch at Colony,Very impressed with the service rendered by Kristin and Poh. They were attentive and really made the difference. Looking forward to the next visit
Family Dinner,"The selection and quality of food is fantastic, special thanks to Kristine for her great and attentive service. A customer spilled soya sauce on me and Kristine was very kind to bring me serviettes and soda water to remove the stains which actually worked."
Birthday celebration at Colony,"Celebrated my daughter‚Äôs 17th birthday with a buffet dinner at Ritz Carlton Colony. Once again, we were treated to a large array of fantastic food, accompanied by wonderful service by the staff. Highly recommended!!"
Wonderful experience + service from Ajay,"We have been here before but today‚Äôs experience was totally different because of the wonderful service from Ajay.

Ajay was very polite, attentive and helpful. He was full of smiles, was very prompt in removing plates from our tables and regularly checked in with us on our experience."
Brilliant Sunday Brunch,"Did the Sunday brunch with a friend for her birthday. Everything was absolutely fantastic. Brilliant service (thanks Azay), amazing food, great atmosphere. Unlike many ""free pour"" banquets, our glasses were kept topped up constantly with quality champagne, and cocktails bought to us even without asking. The selection of food was extraordinary, including loads of fresh seafood along with delicacies from around the world. Desserts were also delightful. I'd go again in a heartbeat."
"Every Possible food that one could imagine, perfectly presented and prepared!!","We stayed three nights at the Ritz on our resent, first trip to Singapore. On the first night, we knew that we would be tired and didn‚Äôt want to venture out too far, so we made reservations at Colony. And it was one of the best decisions of our trip!

They have literally every single type of food one could image‚Ä¶Indian, Chinese, Italitian, a carving station, raw seafood bar, Antipasta section, beautiful breads and absolultely to die for desserts.

While the price was a little higher than one‚Äôs normal buffett, you certainly got your money‚Äôs worth! The staff was friendly, helpful and attentive and the atmosphere was upscale and comfortable.

Definiltey would go back again and I definitely went back for seconds and thirds while at Colony! Enjoy!!"
Great Service!,"I came to dine in with a friend who is your long-term in-house guest of room number 1422. We truly enjoyed our dinner. The food selection was gorgeous. The Asian section is top; we loved every dish there.

I want to comment particularly on one particular staff - Mr Ajay. He is such a delight! He's attentive, he's sincere, genuine and always on the lookout to make sure the guests are well kept with their needs.

There are multiple occasions where he's gone the extra mile to serve and serve with a big smile simply. You can feel his sincerity and that he takes pride in his job.

He truly deserves this recognition. Commendable and genuinely a great asset to the team of Ritz Carlton.

I requested to take a photo with him as I wanted him to understand he made our evening pleasant with his excellent service."
colony buffet,Ajay is very attentive to our needs and very tactful. His service is very remarkable during this 1st experience here at colony ofcourse besides from excellent food experience we had‚Ä¶
Halloween buffet dinner,"Service was amazing!! Azay was so accommodating and made sure we had everything we need during the dinner, to water, tea to taking our plates away in an efficient manner. The buffet has a lot of variety and I would say quite good quality for a buffet. Also a lot of different desserts and since we came for the Halloween special they had themed it to Halloween. Very cute and a lot of attention to detail! A great evening!"
Great value,Food was fantastic and fresh. Service a was good too - thanks Mayank! Highly recommended if you are looking for a good value
Great food great service,"The spread was amazing - which was only rivalled by the good service shown by Mayank. He was extremely attentive and hospitable, which added to the dinner experience. Thank you for the evening!"
Best Buffet in Town,"Decent spread, value for money in terms of quality with fresh sushi and pasta stations. I went to Shangri-La‚Äôs The Line and even though the pricing was marginally cheaper, the quality there doesn‚Äôt come anywhere close to this. Mass market hotel buffet yet very good quality with excellent seafood."
4/5 food. 100000/5 service,"Food had limited selection than the usual hotel setting buffet but my goodness, almost everything was on point. Loved the laksa here than the traditional taste I would get from eating at local eateries. The soup was thick and the lobster balls tastes homemade. The softshell crab was so good too that my mouth is watering writing this. The lamb was just perfect 100/10 melts in your mouth. The only mediocre dishes were the duck/pork roast and sushi selection. The desserts were okay but limited because the hazelnut cake wasn‚Äôt available when we visited.
5 stars for the service though. I am just speechless. We came at the end of f1 night so the place was jam packed, yet, our drinks had never gone empty as our attendants always made sure to ask for replenish.
This is also the only hotel buffet I have eaten that changes your utensils every time they would get used which what I think sets this apart from other 5 star hotels.
The lady who looked after us was Indian looking and the Korean looking gentleman.
We asked to be photographed too and Tessa even offered to take a picture of us in the lobby. Just wow. She gave us tips on how where to shop and what else to do on our remaining nights and took care of us. I think she is a manager there.
Food-wise it is 4 stars but the service 10000/5 makes up for it."
Great food and even better service.,"My first experience was when buffets still weren't allowed. I had an amazing experience and wanted to bring my friends to celebrate their promotion. We were not disappointed and I'm glad that the food is still so fresh and tasty. Especially the seafood.

The staff were very amazing and friendly and made our night. Everyone greeted us at the booths with warm, wide smiles. While we were getting our cold aps, the staff noticed what we were taking and immediately placed warm lemon water on the table for us to wash our hands. Even took a stool for my friend to place her bag without us asking. They were all so attentive helpful. As F&B staff ourselves, we were so pleased by everything.

Special mention to Dong Jin for taking care of our section and table so well. Thank you!"
EXCELLENT!,"Attentive service
Colony serve international dishes, the seafood and sashimi is awesome!!
but the light in the evening is too dim...hope the restaurant can be more light..
And the staff - Xosha really surprise me!! She is really professional and polite. She served cake for us, even I didn't tell her we're celebrating birthday when I made reservation. She noticed it! I'll bring my family here next time!"
Superb Service by Ajay,"The service was superb at Colony. Especially Ajar who was incredibly attentive to our needs and very prompt with catering to our requests and clearing the plates frequently.

Ajay is also very polite and has a great attitude. The food at Colony wasnt really up to our expectations but Ajay made up for a really pleasant experience."
Absolute GREAT and BEST,"The best buffet which absolutely satisfied my fussy taste bud. Wide variety of food and beverage.
Super fresh salmon with awesome fat.
Delicious local food such as laksa, chicken rice.
The salted egg chicken egg was bomb, heavenly nice!

Attentive staffs from hotel lobby all the way to Colony, everyone was great, professional, helpful.

Good environment atmosphere, the photo says it all!

Straight away made reservation again for next visit, we will be back soon!"
Hotel buffet for others to emulate,Returned for the buffet lunch after 3 years. Food quality and service remain top notch. Wish all other buffet places in Singapore will use this place as a benchmark to aspire to.
Quality food and attentive service!,"Came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. There is good variety of food and food is of high quality. As our appetite were quite small, we did not manage to try a lot of food. For those that we had, we particularly love the pan-seared salmon and prawns - both the poached and stir-fried versions were fresh and good. We also like the tiramisu and chocolates.
The staff were attentive and professional. Plates were cleared very quickly and when they noticed us finishing our desserts, they gave us a nice surprise - a small cake for our wedding anniversary.
It was so enjoyable that we will make plans to go back to try the other dishes."
Superb in Every Way!!!,"Four of us enjoyed a spectacular dining experience yesterday at the Sunday Seafood Lunch. The range of dishes available is beyond description. We especially enjoyed the Oysters and Fois Gras- as good as anything one can find in France.
Many thanks to our gracious attendants. If only we could have lunch here every Sunday!!!!"
Colony- Special thanks Daniel and Astha,Special thanks to Daniel who went out of her way to help us make the evening possible. Special thanks to Astha for following up our request. Both are assets to the organisation.
A must do!,The best brunch we have been too. Staff very polite and professional. Very high quality food with a massive selection on offer. A wonderful afternoon spent here. Highly recommend
Dinner,Service was good. Food is fresh. Weekend no card discount. Adult $88 ++ Child $44 ++ Overall is worthwhile for nice meal with family
Anniversary lunch,"weekday buffet lunch has a good spread of good food. Includes cold shell food, sashimi, wide range of cuisine, juices, dessert. Most of all value for money at around 70++ before discount."
Phenomenon experience,"Brilliant service and great food. Best highlight is the chefs , special mention to chef Sundar and Chef Alex for preparing such great dish for us during our special occasion. Thanks to the managers for getting us a table during this busy period! Best Buffet in Singapore"
Pleasant experience and good food,"Went to the international buffet at Colony with a group of friends. We were being served by James and he was really friendly and funny. We had a great evening because of his great service. Food was nice and the seafood is fresh. Overall, it was a good experience at the Colony."
Fantastic dinner with friends and superb service from James,Colony never disappoint me with their fantastic food and superb service. James made this dinner really enjoyable with the great service he provided. He will check with us if we are comfortable and if we need anything every time he walks past our table. Really enjoyed ourselves tonight!
Great buffet lunch at reasonable price,"We tried the lunch buffet twice and having tried several of the popular hotel buffets, we think this is one of the best hotel buffets in Singapore.

Presentation of the food were great and constantly topped up. Quality of the ingredients were top notch and service was prompt with good ambience.

Overall, I highly recommend this buffet restaurant for families and gatherings!"
Amazing breakfast buffet - one of the best I have ever seen,"The Ritz is known as the best hotel in Singapore and one day we went for a business breakfast to Colony. Being a fairly frequent traveler I have seen many breakfast buffets, of which many have been unexciting and with limited choice. But not so at Colony. The best breakfast buffet I have seen so far in my life, quality and quantity, with many items freshly prepared by chefs. The team there is very friendly and professional, the only area to improve is more guest focused and engaging chefs. But everything else is top notch without a doubt. I can highly recommend even if you don't stay at the Ritz, go to Colony for an amazing breakfast to start your day"
Fantastic experience for wedding solemnisation,"My husband and I first got in touch with Alfian to plan our lunchtime solemnisation at Colony and we were very impressed with the service levels provided by Alfian. He was patient with us, and answered all our questions promptly and was able to provide us with great advice to ensure a smooth event on the actual day.

When we faced abysmal service when checking in to our hotel rooms, Alfian also stepped in to assist even though it was not under his purview. Truly, him going the extra mile has made our experience more worthwhile.

On the actual day, Alfian and the Colony team also provided us great support, and ensured that we could start on time despite the heavy breakfast crowd right before our event was slated to start. The food served was also fantastic, and all our guests had great reviews about it and thoroughly enjoyed themselves.

We will definitely be back again with our family to enjoy the food at Colony. Thank you again, Alfian and team for the fantastic experience!"
Quality food,"It was so cold while eating first. Warm tea and coffee were a little lacking. It was a pity that there was only Laksa as a type of noodle dish with soup, but overall, the food was excellent. Especially, snow crabs were in a very good condition."
Wonderful service,"My husband and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary last night at Colony where we got married at last year. Food and service were impeccable as usual and the Prosecco, cake, and greetings of 'welcome back!' were such nice touches that made us feel extra special! Thanks again to the team at Colony :)"
Outstanding,This is without exception a most beautiful dining experience. Wish I could give you 10 stars for everything. Thank you for a beautiful birthday lunch experience.
Nice buffet,"27 of us went for a buffet lunch, all of us enjoy very much, the seafood is very fresh. Will go back again."
Quality of food is good but we are not inform of the closing of food section.,"We are quite happy with the good quality of food.
Surprise that we are not being inform of the food section closing and when we wanted to get some dessert at 210pm. The staffs are busy keeping the trays in front of us. The other food section door was closed too."
Great Place For Time With Family,"The atmosphere setting was comfortable with nice music played in the restaurant. The food spread was good and we are definitely spoiled for chose specially the desserts. We had lunch and also tried out the dinner in the same month. For dinner the bonus is the free flow of fresh oysters, the rest of the dishes were about the same as lunch. The waiters and waitresses are helpful and friendly always ready to serve, they make the dinning experience wonderful. They took note for the seats we requested and reserved for us. I enjoy the sea food cold dish specially the crabs. The only compliant I have is reservations Q, very long weeks sometime months to get a place."
Appreciation,"My family and I would like to place on record our heartfelt appreciation to Raj and Firdausi for going the extra mile in ensuring that our dining at the Colony at Ritz will remain memorable and cherished. Throughout our dining at the esteemed hotel, they made it a point to check on us and even assisted in our selection of dishes and beverages.

Their commitment and drive for excellence is clearly seen in their excellent service, graciousness and attending to us with a smile. They are indeed a great asset to the hotel as their warm hospitality and humour enlightens the ambience and make you want to return to the same place again.

We would also like to thank the following Staff from the Colony for the excellent service and warm hospitality, serving with a smile.

1. Haziq Azhari
2. Danny

The highlight was the pleasant surprise of receiving a special cake as it was our son‚Äôs birthday. This really touched our heart. God bless!

Please convey our deepest thanks to the above mentioned Staff. Looking forward to more sessions at the Ritz.

Cheers
Dr & Mrs Bilveer Singh & Family

Our heartfelt appreciation to Raj and Firdaus for going the extra mile during our dining session as a family on 30/08/22."
Birthday Celebration,"I am here to celebrate my birthday with my family and as a vegetarian with limited choice available From the buffet. I had a wonderful time being served by Chef Ong Kim Hui and the staff (Alona) for providing me and my family such a wonderful service and customized vegetarian meal that was not available in the buffet section.

I will certainly be back again for my next family event.

Thank you"
Excellent food and service as always,"Great food for a great family brunch outing. Thank you Chef Benton, Lee Lee and Tessa for the thoughtful arrangement!"
Wonderful Dining Experience,Great ambience and brightly lighted place. Food was fresh and delicious. We enjoyed ourselves and was well served by the restaurant staff.
Delectable,Love the service provided by the staff. They were very attentive and cater your needs. Especially love their fresh oysters. The best of all buffet that I have tried.
Lobster Seafood Dinner,"Long awaited self serving buffer after almost 2 years of seated buffet style @ Colony. Never miss visiting Colony even during the restrictions period!!

Spread is still good except that the Alaska Crab legs are much too salty as compare to last time. Sashimi had reduced down from 5 to 3 selection, hope can bring back to the 5 selection before the pandemic.

But the Chicken satay was much better than last time.
Nonetheless we still like Colony and their food selections.
Best of all gets to enjoy the NDP‚Äô22 fireworks just across."
Good Service & Food,"Service is very good. There's a wide selection of food, a lot of food never get to taste. Will go again next time. Recommended to friends and relatives too."
Birthday celebration,Excellent service and wide variety of food that is delicious. The team was also thoughtful to prepare a mini birthday cake for my wife.
Birthday celebration,"Great customer service from servers as usual.
Food serves are of good quality. We always enjoyed ourselves at Colony. Love the relaxed ambiance n music.
I had a hard time getting a slot for dinner as we always celebrated my actual birthday there for the past few years.
So we settled for lunch couple of weeks later.

*chef at popiah section is very kind and sweet"
Lunch Date,I like to thank the Staff for making our lunch possible as I reserved for 4 Adults but realised my Child not schooling that day and he can join us and his Grandmother for lunch but Colony was unable to accept a extra Pax but they finally made an arrangement that day so we can go as a Family for lunch to enjoy the day out.
This is a MUST visit when in Singapore,"I've been here before, this time with my entire family. I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly, you will not get a wider choice of more high quality seafood anywhere in the world. Food choices are amazing, during our 3 week Asian trip this was our number one favourite place"
Amazing service,The service was impeccable by all the service staff. Especially James who seemed to be the floor manager. When they found out im vegetarian they prepared additional dishes and was so accompdating and really made us feel welcomed. All the staff were so attentive and we never felt like we needed any additional effort.
Amazing first class buffet.,. This was truly worth the hype and price. The service was impeccable and the food was great. The seafood was so fresh and the the hot bar was enormous. There was no way that I could have tried everything.
Excellent Dining with large spread of international buffet,"Everything is great, only that for a thursday night, the oyster bar is limited to 1 type of oyster. Hope the variety of oysters can extend to more days as Friday , sat and sunday booking is almost 4 weeks advance"
Great first post-lockdown dinner buffet,"Have to say that aside from the great spread of food (western, chinese, indian and dessert bar), we loved the service the most. Hnin (apologies if the name is spelt wrongly, we couldn't see his name tag- Bespectacled, crew cut hairstyle, dressed in white) was an excellent server- introduced himself from the very start of the meal, was very attentive to our needs and constantly checked in on our drinks if they needed top up. I think the cherry on the top was when he brought in the birthday cake for our mom- very genuine and sincere service and even proactively offered to take a family photograph for us. (We soon later realized he had to do the same for 3 neighboring tables - but his efforts were just as earnest and whole-hearted) I do hope HR / managers at Colony consider this during his performance evaluation -- definitely an excellent server, a rare sight nowadays in the F&B industry. The rest of the wait staff were very attentive and pleasant as well, accommodating for our little 2 year old at the table - 2 thumbs up! We were recommended to try Colony out by our colleagues, and we will definitely recommend this further to others as well. Keep up the good work and great service :)"
Amazing dining experience,We enjoyed our dining experience at the Colony. The food and vibe were amazing. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Special mention to Dora who helped to arrange a birthday cake and ensured we were well taken care of. Will definitely come back again!
