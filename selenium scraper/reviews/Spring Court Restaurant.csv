Terrible smell and poor service.,"Terrible experience with this resto

There was a toilet smell throughout the restaurant today. The staff said something is wrong with the exhaust.

It is still cny festive and we ordered the set course for 4 people. The staff seem to rush us 4 dishes came all at once and not one by one . The table was full of food and we felt rushed. For a expensive lunch. We expected it one plate by another . The first dish they served was actually fried prawn as starters

The fish was given in solo plates. One fish was 50% of the other

When we were given the bill. Turns out the staff gave us the wrong menu and asked us to pay extra 100. They ogfered us a 50 dollars viucher but i didnt want to go back. After aome dialogue exchang they agreed to give it back based on what we ordered. But it was a bad feeling.

A very unfortunate dining experience."
Good quality dim sum!,"We had dim sum lunch to celebrate for 2 of our ladies' birthdays. Food is good and tasty. I had reserved a table for 7 but was given a table for 10 instead. The server managed to exchange a smaller table for us so that we can sit closer and eat happily. The signature popiah took slightly longer time to be served but upon a few times of chasing, they managed to rush it out for us. The service was good as none of the servers show any attitudes for all our troublesome requests eg. more chilli, refilling of tea, changing to smaller table etc. They did not chase or asked us to leave even the dim sum lunchtime had ended. A very enjoyable place for dim sum!"
Don't understand to hype,"Nothing lived up to expectation from other reviews. Service was unfriendly, very slow and condescending and the food bland and uninteresting."
something new,"tried this place because saw a show on television, and it seemed pretty interesting. when we came, the suggested food at the event was already finished. so we replace it with something else, the taste is good, it's just that the restaurant is too busy, so it's very full. we are not comfortable with this situation."
Mixed feelings,"The sweet sour pork, roast duck, yulan chicken, braised lamb were tasty. The steam soon hock was so so. Steam prawns not bad. Double boiled chicken soup ok but not great. Too many flies in the restaurant. Understaffed but they really tried their best."
Can be Improved,"Went to Spring Court Restaurant after many years since they were last in River Valley.
However, the following are what we feel should be righted:

1. The stench that smells like sewage when you entered the restaurant. It permeates the whole restaurant even at our table which was right at the far end from the fish tank. When we asked the serving staff where the smell is coming from, we were told it was from the mouldy air con system! Imagine breathing in mould while dining in the restaurant.

2. Yes, the common complaint about the poor service standard is true. I put on our reservation that we will need 3 highchairs for our toddlers, but no highchair was present when we were brought to our reserved big table. When asked, they brought the highchairs to us, and walked away without helping to arrange it around the table. We were made to put away the chairs to a corner to create space for the highchairs as no wait staff was around to help us arrange the seating.

3. The lauded yam ring was good except that the filling was half filled with canned button mushrooms. It would have been a fitting filling for the delicious yam ring if all the veggies are fresh, but unfortunately it is mostly filled with canned mushrooms.

4. They are obviously short staffed as no one came to replenish our cups with our drink during our whole lunch. But the restaurant was full on a Saturday lunch time. When we entered at 11am, we were told that we need to finish our lunch by 12.45pm.

The Pros:
1. The wait staff were polite and nice when they attended to us.

2. The food is generally well cooked. Hence, the popularity.

I think it will be another few years before I step back into Spring Court to help me forget the negative aspects of our experience there."
Christmas Eve,Took the family to Spring Court. the pig trotters dish was very good. waiters were helpful and good service. Xiao Long Bao was a disappointment. Overall will go back again and good ambience after the renovation.
Good food but expensive. Slow service,Good food . Slow service . Quite expensive not worth the money . The ambience of the place if quite nice .
Very pleasant experience.,Will definitely revisit again. Thumbs up to crew attentiveness and excellent service despite restaurant was packed and busy.
Clay pot chilli crab was awful,"The waiter persuaded me to order the clay pot chilli crab although it was not my intention to eat crabs that night. We paid $117 for one crab. However, the soft and soggy crab meat that is stuck to the shells is the worst I have ever eaten. The crab was not fresh and the meat could not be lifted from the shells because it was stuck to the shells. Not worth the amount we paid for."
Bone in my Peking Duck Wrapü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,"It‚Äôs longevity of 93yrs is the reason I visited them. But it didn‚Äôt meet my expectation, especially when I bite onto a bone in my Peking duck wrap! I was taken aback in part due to my recent chipped tooth incident, also never happened to me before with Peking duck wrap, let alone from this restaurant. It must be human error but still‚Ä¶nonetheless I told the waitress about it and decided not to pursue it."
Apply Membership.,"My Clients and me all Android phone, cannot scan QR quote to apply for membership. Nobody came to assist. Staff simply says Apple phones able to scan. We decide, in the future, to entertain clients at other restaurants at China Point. Take a long time to have our food."
Service not up to standard,Didn‚Äôt expect time limit of 90mins dine in. One of the dish was not serve after an hour of ordering. Check with the staff but never get back to us. Only serve when I almost ask for bill.
"Improved Food, Good but pricey crabs","I‚Äôm happy to dine in a good old restaurant that has withstood the test of time & I pray it‚Äôll continue for many generations to come. Its a tough trade. Albeit the cost of the Chilli Crab , flavours are well balanced. Roast piglet was good too. Service could be faster but willing and friendly crew, so that made up. Popiah is huge n tasty as I remembered. Post covid many chinese restaurants strugggled to retain or go back to the standard as before but Spring Court is one of the few I feel has managed & even improved a bit. Cheers"
Food was decent. Most service staff were lacking,"Initially the dishes came in a timely fashion, but our final dish took 45min and we waited and waited, and had to constantly remind staff. Seemed like some communication breakdown with kitchen.
Then when it came to payment, we were overcharged on beers, and had to wait another 30min just for staff to find QR code for Shopback payment. When we hurried them, we were met with some patronising responses and insincere apology. Understand the staff might have had a busy night, but service was overall a huge letdown."
Reliable restaurant,Been there many times. Dim sum is great and the staff efficient. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
Excellent Customer Service,Overall the dining experience at spring court was great. My friend told me their services was great and the foods was nice as well. They intend to bring their family to visit this restaurant again.
Service lacking,"We have always enjoyed going to Spring Court for a sumptuous meal. But the last two visits after the relaxation of restrictions, we find that they maybe facing a lack of staff.
There was nobody to serve us or even give us the menu after we were seated n hv to try v hard to get their attention. Also this is second time that what we wanted on the menu are not available esp the desserts.
Quite disappointing"
Good Food but service can be improved,"We made our booking at Springcourt on a Sunday lunch time and was grateful that the staff is able to sit us earlier than our booking time as we arrived 30 mins earlier. The food was good and the waiting time for the food (we ordered mainly Dimsum) was fast. However, the restaurant or the section that we are seated at was understaffed. The servers took a long time to take our orders, refill teas and etc. While we can emphatized the staff's situation, the overall dining experience was marred."
It‚Äôs too popular,"We were a bit disappointed when a few dishes I wanted to try was not available. No chicken feet, no cold desserts, sad. Will be back to try and review later."
REVIEW BY DR H C MATTHEW SIM - Oldest Chinese Restaurant in Singapore. Great Food.,"REVIEW BY DR H C MATTHEW SIM - Oldest Chinese Restaurant in Singapore. Great Food. I had lunch with most of their specialties. I like the chicken, fish maw soup, chee cheong fan, yam basket, cabbage. Overall great food. Great company. Regards Dr H C Matthew Sim"
Deja vu!,"I have been eating at Spring Court since it was at Upper East Coast Road. The ambience is still there. Food wise, it is not bad. We went for lunch at 1pm but some of the dim sum were finished. Service was good but seemed like they were short of staff."
Great,"Food were good as ever, but due to its was a crowded weekend food was slow. Staff try their very best to serve all table. Overall still great‚Ä¶.."
Quality food,Very tasty food. Good service. Won't break the bank. Recommended for big groups too. Must try the signature popiah. Had no complaints from our group of five under covid rules.
Good service and ambience environment!,Overall I should give a 5 star excellent service and good food for this dinner. The private room has a good ambience. The best was when how the birthday cake was presented with a bonsai by the restaurant. It was an excellent idea!
Lunch at Spring Court,"The popiah is a must order item. Dim Sum was good, but nothing really special. Will plan to go back to the restaurant again."
Very low quality/price,"For last CNY diner, we made this reservation but were forced to book the CNY 5-pax set for 538 $ ++ (630 $), which didn't even include a cup of tea ... the foods were very normal (fish, chicken, scallop ...) nothing outstanding to justify the high price. The service was so so, initially we were told ""a la carte"" was possible then the manager came to say we need to go for the set. In addition, we were reduced to a 2-hour diner, as they did 2 rounds of diner for the same evening. It's ok to charge a high price for CNY diner (and we accepted it), but with such a mediocre offer ? Clearly, they are taking advantage of their so called ÁôæÂπ¥ËÄÅÂ≠óÂè∑Ôºåbut this will end someday. Other customers like us, will not come back to this restaurant again."
Chinese New Year eve lunch,"CNY eve lunch, menu was special. No Tim sum nor popiah! We ordered their double boiled sharks-fin soup which tasted awesome. Their lobster platter, yam basket with prawns, roasted chicken and their baked fragrant rice with lotus leaves. The food tasted good and well presented. Service was attentive and friendly. Price was on the higher plain. A popular place restaurant among the locals. It had a long history and situated on a Main Street with parking on the opposite side of the main road."
Old School Vibe with Great Service,One of the oldest Chinese restaurant in Singapore. The services staff were really accommodating and friendly. Food was great. One of the few restaurant that I will bring my friends from overseas to dine in.
Food,Tasty food Location is central Easy to reserve a table Menu had photos of food and it made ordering easy
Overall quality has dropped,"We have been frequenting this restaurant for a few years and they are not know for being cheap but serving quality foood. However, our last lunch on 7 Jan proved disappointing. Not only is food portion much smaller, but overall taste of mist dishes are below their usual standard. Hence, making us feel the lunch is very much over-priced. Service staff are also not as friendly and prompt as before."
Great meal at old Cantonese style restaurent,"Spring Court is a very old brand in Cantonese cuisine and dates back to more than 50 years ago that I have actually experienced. It used to be in Oriental Theatre building in Chinatown and has been in the current premises for a long time as well. The food is very good, and inexpensive. Valet pakring was efficient."
The taste of a century-old restaurant in Chinatown,"The restaurant, which opened in 1929, has been around for more than 90 years, carrying the flavours of generations, and is one of the few, yet truly long-established restaurants in Singapore.

The five-storey colonial building along the street seems to tell the story of the many years and stories this restaurant has carried, with its quaint decor and retro decor transporting you back to the 90s.

The dishes have also been baptized by time, just like the centuries that have passed, making them even more delicious and unique. It seems to be the place to go when it comes to local food in the Lion City.

‚ñ™ Spring Court Traditional Poplah 7.8++
A signature dish of Spring Court, it is available in spicy or plain flavors. The light crust is wrapped with fresh shrimp, fish and fresh, crisp shredded bok choy, served with a sweet and sour sauce.

‚ñ™ Roasted Chicken Stuffed with Minced Prawns 24++
A love match between chicken and prawn, fresh handmade prawn crackers are sandwiched between chicken and fried in the most original way to present the most delicious dish. The chicken is crispy and crisp, while the prawns are tender. Served with a special sauce, it is definitely a gourmet

‚ñ™ Crab Meat Roll with Chicken Liver and Salted Egg 13.8++
The salted egg yolk is wrapped in shredded crab meat and complemented by chicken liver on the side to make a crab roast phoenix liver. The freshness of the crab meat neutralizes the greasiness from the deep-frying and is a very creative dish.

‚ñ™ Braised Bee Hoon with Crabmeat 24++
Favorite crab for main course. The Sai crab here is smooth and tender, tasting like crab meat, and tossed with rice noodles for a great taste.

‚ñ™ Steamed Vegetable and Minced Prawns Dumpling 4.8++
The skin is thin and full of filling, The prawn is filling your month with just one bite .

The shop also offers a wide range of snacks at very affordable prices, each of which tastes great, and is full of happiness no matter how you eat it!

Great experience,Service staff was great and friendly Food was also as per description and great. Will comeback again
Great Value Promotion,We spent $92 and were entitled to buy the whole roasted chicken for 0.56 cents! Unbelievable. Food is good overall except the popular popiah is overrated.
Wonderful family gathering at this nostalgic yet modern Spring Court Restaurant,This is my first meal at a restaurant after the recent Phase 2 restriction and pleasantly surprised by the experience. The food is acceptable. The ambience is good; we are able to chat and makan. Leant some history of the restaurant too... one of the famous restaurant left. Felt connected as it is part of our Singapore history too. Will be back..
Great food!!,Great food!!! love every dishes that's being served. the space we were seated is quite cold though..
"Great Tim Sum, Questionable recommendation from staff","Returning to Spring Court for the second time for Tim Sum which is of good standards. This time we took the recommendation from their ""star'' dish - the crab bee hoon trusting the staff would suggest items that would go well with the rest of the tim sum/ for breakfast but it turns out to be a huge (in all aspect) and much more suitable for dinner menu (and for larger group).
Tim sum is still good but left with a bitter taste. We will return but not trusting the staff on recommendation going forward."
First time dining in Spring Court - won't be the last!,Always wanted to try this place. Glad we could 'chope' a table. Glad we were able to eat dim sum which were fresh and delicious. Will plan to go back and try the peking duck!
Still the same great taste,This was the restaurant my parents hosted their wedding dinner in almost 60 years ago. We have been returning from time to time. The food is still authentic and great! The service and the service staff were all excellent as well.
Outstanding service from robot complements great food,"It‚Äôs one of the oldest restaurants in singapore. Strong staple of signature dishes which u should not deviate from, popiah, roast chicken w prawns, yam ring and prawns Hor fun all excellent, freshly prepared, tasty dishes. Not cheap but worth it, yam ring cost $39. Lots of experienced staff but they were no match for the robotic waiter that delivers and retrieves the core dishes, if only the human staff could match that efficiency. Well worth a visit for the great food and to support local institutions."
Not the Spring Court I Knew,"Miles apart from how it was used to be about five years ago. Was back to reminisce the good old time, food and ambiance, but left disappointed. We miss the old Spring Court."
Good Family Meal,"On Fri 12 Mar, my family went for dinner at Spring Court for a double birthday celebration. Our children and 2 guests enjoyed the food very much especially the yam ring and crab dishes.
I would have given a 5-star rating if not for the following:
1. A waitress accidentally spilled some hot water onto my wife's right arm when she was refilling my wife's tea-cup because she forgot / did not bring the tea-cup away from the guest/table. Thankfully it was not a lot of water and it was not very hot.
2. My wife did not enjoy the crab bee-hoon as much as when we ate it in Dec last year. This was because the sauce in the dish is the XO sauce which contained chilli. My wife is very allergic to anything with chilli and pepper. Jenny, the restaurant manager apologised that in her being overwhelmed by the good business that night, she has forgotten to ask if we wanted the XO sauce. We assumed she would remember about my wife's allergic sensitivity and therefore did not remind her.
But Jenny was very nice and gave us a complimentary dessert - Chinese pancake."
Dinner,"My friends and me are still insist on serving the traditional taste, but it failed except for Traditional Popiah because it's suckling pig is like being warmed up via microwave before letting us to eat and Kailan is very cold that we believed it had been left there for 20 minutes before putting on our table. In fact, we had been waiting for half an hour for that dish after finishing eating suckling pig."
a not so good experience... not sure if its with Chope... or the restaurant.....,"I made a reservation on 23 Feb. I had to pay a $80 deposit to make the reservation on Chope. I needed to make some changes and I tried to cancel the reservation at the restaurant. They told ok, can cancel and hung the phone up. I called back again immediately and asked if I could get my deposit back. They said if I cancel, the deposit will be forfeited. I said if its going to be forfeited, I will not cancel. The staff even challenged me that once I cancel, it cannot be reinstated.

I had to tell that staff off. I told them that before I could say anything else, all I heard was ""ok, cancel, bye bye"". I did not even have a chance to ask if I could get the deposit back. This reservation experience is lousy in my opinion."
A wonderful lo hei,"The service staff looking at Table 311 was excellent. very good attitude, very friendly and totally makes you feel welcomed and appreciated as a diner."
Not worth it,The foods present was totally different with the menu And dishes was served fast but presentation was bad
Awesome Dining Experience,"My family of 8 had a delectable dining experience at Spring Court. The Service Manager Jenny provided great assistance to us with the order, explaining the dishes and if its the appropriate amount of our pax. All the dishes were sumptious with delightful presentation. We particularly enjoyed the cold plate display with a dainty selection of tasty cold dishes. The dessert were delicious too. The service staff attending to us was very attentive and pleasant. An excellent experience and we certainly look forward to be dining at the restaurant soon."
Reunion dinner,I was only told that we had to finish our dinner by 730pm when we arrived. We ordered quickly but the food was slow in coming. Eventually we had to da pao one of our dishes
Great food and service,"Dear Spring Court, We had a birthday celebration last Friday and the food was nostalgic and superb quality freshness. We also like to compliment Ms Tina Huang for her attentive service and friendly smile which makes us feel homely. Thank you Regards, Mr Lee"
Popular with locals for its consistency,"Popular with locals for its popiah, sharks fin soup, chicken with prawns, braised cabbage with dried scallops, it‚Äôs tim sum has served many customers over the years. Multi storied restaurant while the owner is always around to greet its guest. Ambience is clean and tidy. Service is prompt with many servers being there for many a years. The onee is also tasty. Price is mid range to high depending what is being ordered."
Spring Court Lunch on Christmas Day,"The food was presentable, looks good, service was awesome as well. Ambiance of the place is good as well. We ordered the fat popiah, it is delicious, but a bit expensive for 1 roll of $8, crispy pork bun is crispy and nice, fried silver fish can be better, unable to taste the fish, super mini egg tarts, XO fried carrot cake is good, siu mai is normal, hong bak pao is good, lotus leaf rice can be better with more meat and lap cheong, the hor fun is a bit overrated, only got big prawns. But overall, we had our stomach full to the brim! Nice. We were a bit disappointed when we got to know that all the credit card promotions, or app payment methods was not allowed on PH, which we were unaware when we booked the place."
Average,"Signature food is not that good. The popiah was so soggy inside. The cabbage with scallops is just average. The dried scallop is not bad. Had the crispy chicken too. That is good. Even the breast meat is soft and not dry. The yam ring is okay abit too big. Will be better if we can have different sizes. The beef is soft too. However, the rice is quite sticky.
Service is not that good. Had to wait for quite some time for our drinks to be served."
Disappointing signature dishes,"Been a while since last visit. Ordered several signatures dishes to treat friends. Regrettably, all of them were disappointing. The skins of the must-try popiah were soggy inside out due to too generous sweet black sauce inside The seasonal priced deep fried soon hock was not crispy at all. We did not finish it among a party of five, even though one of my friends love fish dishes. Worst was the premium fish maw mushroom soup recommended by the manager. There were only one/two small pieces of maw in each bowl. Price at $28.80 per bowl, you felt ripped off. The half roasted chicken stuffed with minced prawns tasted cold & the skin of the chicken tough to chew. The signature dishes were really lousy considering the prices paid. The only saving grace was the promotion yam ring at $0.91. Ended up enjoying only the tim sum steamed pork ribs, fried carrot cake with XO sauce & siew mai. Staff to table ratio was low and service lacking."
Bad Service,"There living insect on our table , ask for assist. Staffs walk pass us few time simply treat us like invisible."
Authentic Cantonese Cuisine,"Whenever we dine in Sprint Court, it brings back fond memories of our good old days celebrating family events, eg birthdays, weddings, Chinese New Year Reunion dinner, etc. You will always get quality food and excellent services !"
Spring Court Restaurant,Enjoyed the unique dishes available in this restaurant. The food portion is reasonable and the ambience was good. Seems to be short of service staff though.
Great food!,"Excellent service and great food! Staff were very prompt in serving us, even though the restaurant was rather crowded."
"When ""old"" means ""gold""","My wife and I brought our elderly mothers out for dim sum lunch at Spring Court just this week. Since both of them, Cantonese, spent a good amount of time in Chinatown during their youth, we thought Spring Court would be most appropriate - located in Chinatown, serves traditional Cantonese dim sum, traditional and yet grandeur setting, lovely service staff who spoke good Cantonese too. We particularly like the pig trotters in vinegar, prawn dumpling (har gao) and ÁîüÁÖéÂåÖ (pan-fried minced pork buns - Chinese version of Gyoza). We ordered a good spread of dim sum and each of them was a conversation topic for our mothers. We like to compliment the concierge cum valet driver who was at the main entrance; and he treated our mothers (who had difficulty walking) with such great care and gentleness."
Top choice for the authentic Singapore Chinese Food,My local friends introduced this restaurant to me many years ago. I find it is very well-known among Singaporeans. The popiah is a must-choice. Roast duck is super nice. Good place for family and friends. And a perfect place for those tourists who want to experience the Singapore Chinese food.
Best har gow and yam ring,"We had dim sum and yam ring. Har gow is the best we tried so far. The skin has a spring to it and prawns are very fresh. The fried carrot cake is ok but the bean sprout smell is too strong. The yam ring is the best dish. The yam is fluffy, fresh, crispy. The ingredients are fresh and has a balanced taste, not too salty."
Great Experience,It has been a long time since my wife and I dine at Spring Court. The service was great and food was of high quality. A good variety of dim sum and price was reasonable.
"Poor Service, Mediocre food","I was there on a sunday, for lunch with my family. When we were ready to order, despite raising our hands multiple times and indicating to the servers that we would like to order, we were not being served.

There were eye-contacts with the waiter and we were ignored. After several times, and our attempts to frantically wave our hands, even to the extent of calling out for the waiter, only then we were finally served.

This is such a bad service, despite being one of the most iconic restaurants in Singapore. We were very disappointed in the service. Food was mediocre.

I don't think we will patronise in the future. Being one of the most iconic restaurants in Singapore should not be providing such bad service."
Standard bearer of Singapore Style Cantonese Food,"This restaurant has been around for more than 90 years. Not many establishments can claim to have been around so long, especially in the high turnover restaurant trade. Obviously spring court has many things going for it to last so long.

Cantonese cuisine is not homogenous. There is a Singapore style as opposed to HK style and Malaysia style. Sadly, there are few Singapore style ones left and Spring Court is the standard bearer

Traditonal dishes that are hard to find nowadays can be found here. The golden dragon chicken is a good example. A chicken is deboned and then stuffed with prawn paste and fried. The yam pot is executed almost to perfection. And the crispy noodles with prawn and egg is a delight as well. The salty egg chicken liver roll brings back memories of the 70s and 80s.

Eating here is a very enjoyable walk down the gastronomic memory lane."
Good memories,"Spring Court was the restaurant I used to go as a child. We would celebrate all festivities there. My trip there last Saturday was the first in many many years, and it certainly brought me down memory lane. Loved the old photos hanging in the walls. Even though Spring Court has relocated to where it is now, it still evokes some good old memories of my dining experiences as a child. Love also the dim sum selections."
Good food as always!,Had our usual roast chicken and yam ring which were yummy. Tried new dishes - popiah and beancurd with scallop - very good too! And the orh-nee here is consistently delicious!
"Great Food, Tranquil Ambience, Wonderful Outing","Brought my sister and elderly parents for dim sum lunch as an ""outing"" after months of being home-bound. Wonderful service from the front valet counter service staff who literally propped my elderly folks with gentleness from the car door to their table! Loved the har gau, buns, phoenix feet, and pig trotters. The whole experience was unhurried, peaceful and wonderful. Thanks very much giving my folks a great ""outing."""
Poor service and dirty cutlery,"Service staff were not attentive. The drinking glass had red stains in them, even after I asked to change the glasses"
"Food was disappointing, yet overpriced","It has been more than a decade since our family visited Spring Court, and we forgot why we stopped going, so let's give it a try.

Firstly, there was display online and on the tables of 50% off their Chicken stuffed with Prawn. But when we ordered, they said they couldn't enter the code, so could b only used on next visit.

IKR, WTH but Nonetheless, we still ordered. The half chicken looked like quarter chicken as each piece had very little meat.

Their Peppered Beef came sizzling hot so we were enticed, but it was tasteless. Honestly, you can't tell if it was pork, beef or venison.

Their Popiah was very fresh and made on the spot. It costs $8+ each, yet tasted worse than those $1.50 ones in coffeeshops.

Their Fried Rice was not bad, as they used the lupcheong to fry it, so it had the lupcheong taste in the rice.

Their Hor fun Omelette with Prawns sounded promising, but the Hor fun turned out to be bland and tasteless with just gravy poured over it. Totally no wokhei.

We tried the sea cucumber with mushroom and it was very average. We could have done that ourselves at home.

Throughout all these, the wait was very long as they had only 2 waitresses who could take orders. When we were hesitating on what else to order, their eyes rolled up and said to call again when ready.

When we wanted water instead of tea, eyes rolled up again. And the staff actually commented on why we ordered so little, when other customers always order a lot.

Before the night was over, the 5 of us had our memories rekindled as to why we stopped going there for more than a decade."
Since 1929,"Priding itself as Singapore‚Äôs oldest Chinese restaurant, since 1929 this establishment is popular with the locals as well as serving delicious food. The popiah or fresh spring roll is not only good tasting but it is also a mouthful. A must try! Their double boiled superior sharks fin with chicken and wanton soup is another good dish. Their yam ring with prawn and vegetables, Chinese cabbage with dried scallops and fried chicken with prawns paste are house specialities. The taste is acceptable though not wow! The yam with ginkgo nuts dessert is another great tasting dish. Environment is a clean modern restaurant in a heritage building. Parking is opposite at Chinatown Point mall. Price is mid to high end dependent on the dishes ordered."
Excellent service and food.,Excellent service by manager Eric. Good food and nice ambiance (conserved pre-war shop house). Private rooms on 4th floor are good for hosting guests.
food great but lacked atmosphere,"Lovely food but unfortunately with the virus that has hit Asia , the restaurant was very quite - however I would definitely be back when in Singapore"
CNY 2020 Company Dinner,Our CNY 2020 Company Dinner was held here on Wednesday 5/2/20. We had 3 tables and a private room for our annual event. The dishes were good especially the suckling pig which we all enjoyed. There‚Äôs also a karaoke machine in the private function room.
Ren Ri celebration with rush eating,"My reservation was on Ren Ri 31Jan 6pm. Upon reaching our reserved table, was told that we have to return the table by 7:30pm as there is a 2nd round of sitting. We were rushed by the server to finished up all the dishes throughout the dinner and desserts were served before we can finished our mains. We order a peking duck which was served at 7:15pm and was rushed to finish it. Food were pretty decent but not a great dining experience as we have a ‚Äòmum‚Äô constantly rushing us to finish our food."
Food quality is good and the service crew is professional,I have a reunion dinner party there. The room is comfortable and the service crew is good. The food is fine but the quantity is a big less. Overall experience is nice. Might be expensive to go there in Chinese new year.
Terrible service,"We waited for 2 hours since we placed our order for table of 10pax at 12.15pm, only to be served 2 out of 6 dishes despite multiple follow-ups with manager and service crew. In the end, another 3 dishes were served around 2pm when the restaurant was soon to close the afternoon service at 2.30pm. We cancelled the last dessert dish as we grew angry and tired of waiting.

It‚Äôs as though the kitchen did not register our orders or the servers kept sending our orders to other patrons (eg. similar dishes). Terrible service indeed, totally dampened our festive mood. If the kitchen cannot cope with the orders during the festive season, why accept our reservation in the first place? Definitely not returning customers, pity the food tasted not bad."
Delicious food,"The taste is worth the price. My family and I had an enjoyable experience at the restaurant. While the restaurant serves the usual selection of Cantonese cuisine, the premium execution and freshness of ingredients set it apart from the usual restaurants."
Authentic Singapore experience,A friend who lives in Singapore recommended Spring Court. We really enjoyed this authentic local restaurant. I think we were the only European couple there. The staff are really helpful and welcoming. Everyone was having a great time and so did we.
Very good choice of food,"Went there with 2 young children aged 7 & 11. No children‚Äôs menu as such but the wide range on the menu made it easy to find something suitable for them. Food was very good, in particular the crispy duck, sweet & sour pork and the broccoli/ginger and scallops. Recommend you go early as it looks like they operate 2 sittings. We got there at 6.00pm with no reservation and by 6.30pm it was packed."
spring court,"visited the restaurant with friends for a birthday celebrations. the services was average, we waited a long time before they serve us although there was not much crowd. the salted custard buns still very good quality."
The Benchmark in Singapore Chinese Cuisine,"I have been dining in Spring Court since 40+ years ago when I was a kid. I find that Spring Court not only upholds the standard of traditional Singapore Cantonese cuisine, it keeps evolving and improving and pushes itself towards better food quality and customer service. Hope it will continue to live up to its name - which stands for ever green, and we shall continue to enjoy excellent dining at value pricing."
Weekend Dim Sum,Our favourite dim sum restaurant. We always go for the kong ba bao and chee chong fun #Springcourtsg
Delicious food,"My family and I came here for dinner and the food was delicious, the staff were friendly, alongside its traditional Chinese environment. Highly recommended."
Good better best,"Delicious dishes, lots of old favourites like chicken in yam basket, crispy skin chicken. Excellent service even when this Cantonese cuisine restaurant was very busy. Very convenient to book on line and was seated at a nice round table near the window. Parked in Chinatown Point across the road. Highly recommend this restaurant to everyone, locals and tourists."
Nice food and ambiance,"It was for my mother in law's 50th birthday celebration, we ordered the 6pax menu and the food was splendid. The popiah might looks normal but it taste superb. Highly recommended!"
Great spot for dim sum,"Love the selection of dim sum, and the special they had on yam ring! Would recommend their popiah and yam ring"
Dinner at Spring Court,Popiah was the reason we came and was good! Love the ambience and quiet setting for us to talk with friends!
Small portion,"We have 8 persons and ordered a 10pax package $638++. Portion is small. Example the shark fin with crab meat, after portion out to 8 bowls, the bowl is not even full."
Good food but slow service,"The food is good, not salty at all, yet tasty. Suitable for all. That day was crowded, therefore the service rather slow. The place is a bit noisy as there are people singing KTV (they are having birthday celebration)."
"Nice restaurant, good food but not attentive","The food and service is good, as expected a restaurant with a long history. Deco is nice, very comfortable but we encounter 1 issue on that day. When ordering, we insisted that all food is non spicy as I have a 3 & 6 years oid. Staff confirmed non spicy but when the tofu is served, they are tiny bits of chili in the meat, these are used as garnish. For adult, these are nothing but kids can't take the heat. I mix it in their rice without checking, my son took 1 mouth and reject the rest. The staff should be more attentive in knowing we have kids and the chef should follow instruction clearly."
Nice place with fun service staff,Service staff with an amazing sense of humor and the food was great to top it off! You have to try the poh piah... we took the single pax set. though portions were small but the quality was good.
Spring Court Dim Sum,Love this place! Food was great at reasonable prices with great service. Will definitely be back for more
Spring court,I have been here many times to celebrate happy moments with my love ones. The dim sum was the most enjoyable and the braised meat with bao were yummy. D
Long History Restaurant,"We decided to try this restaurant that specialize in Cantonese Cuisine for the past 80 years.
The decorations is pretty impressive and, service is very good.
We ordered their famous Pop Piah which to me is very average with soggy skin.
The Suckling piglet is crispy and tasty.
The Sea Cucumber with Chinese Shitake Mushroom is done to perfection with delicious gravy.
The steam salted chicken is tasty with tender meat and the right saltiness.
It was an enjoyable dinner for our gathering."
Rich history in Singapore Chinatown,"This is a totally elegant restaurant in Singapore Chinatown. From the time you enter, you are treated royally. The menu is loaded with things to try, and we had the roasted chicken in addition to dim sum and broccoli. We completely enjoyed our dinner, and I couldn't eat another bite. The service was impeccable. The walls show important times in the history of the restaurant, and you feel a connection with its past. There is plenty of parking on the street. The restaurant is handicapped accessible. Definitely worth a try if it is your first trip to Singapore."
Dinner - 2nd shift - 7.30pm,Was disappointed that famous Popiah was sold out as we went there for popiah. Person on phone could have highlighted when taking reservation. Overall dinner was excellent food quality esp deep fried soon Hock. Staff service excellent. Staff who took reservation could have informed us that was valet available. My sister ended parking 10 mins away :(
good food,"food was tasty, reasonable price, nice service.
the restaurant was rather empty when we got there, only 2 other tables were occupied. so i dont understand why they had to sit the next 2-3 groups of china tourists at the tables next to ours. we couldnt hear ourselves talk. a blemish in an otherwise nice experience."
Excellent first visit experience,"Visited Spring Court on 22/6/19 with my family of 8 for dim sum lunch. Food is great! Everyone left the restaurant after 1.5 hours with a great sense of satisfaction and unanimously thinking about when to come back for our second visit. Many dishes are great highlights, such as fried carrot cake, char-siew bao, Har-Kow, chicken feet, kong-bak bao, Cheong-fun, steam beancurd roll and xiaolongbao . We tried the traditional popiah too. We had Peking duck with fried rice as second prep but it was just average. We wrapped up the sumptuous meal with a unique dessert - bird nest coconut."
Wonderful restaurant!,Happy Anniversary! My family has always enjoyed the lotus leaf rice and the popiah. The food here has consistently good and we always look forward to coming back to celebrate special occasions with the family.
Lovely historic restaurant,"The oldest family-owned Chinese restaurant in Singapore, and well worth a visit. Excellent food and good service, at a premium. We enjoyed the popiah and a yam ring, along with other dishes. Decor is not as good as the food, but still a pleasant place for a traditional Chinese dinner."
