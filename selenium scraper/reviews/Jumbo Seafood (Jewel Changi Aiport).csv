Alaskan Crab,Mud crab texture is more like scallop but Alaskan crab texture is more like lobster. Alaskan crab is unique and delicious. Alaskan crab has a lot meat! Highly recommended! Hor Fan is good too!
Fantastic food and service as always,The food and service are both impeccable. The only grouse being the background music was too loud (both the volume and the type) for my liking.
Food was good. Staff service so so.,Staff need more training. More polite. They don‚Äôt have service mind. It‚Äôs like food court. Anyway food is good. It‚Äôs good to taste Singapore crab.
Great meal before leaving Singapore,I wanted to try Chili crab before I left Singapore. Wasn't disappointed. The food was good and the price was reasonable.
Awesome Seafood Place,"Jumbo is awesome. Went to the one at Jewel Airport. Food is fresh, service is good. Enjoyed my dining experience there"
Family dinner at Jumbo,"Over weekends at Jewel it is difficult to find a seating for a family dinner , however we managed to Chope a family seating of 3 at Jumbo ."
Worth visiting,"Definitely should try cereal prawns!
The seafood fried rice was also great.
The atmosphere was great too.
But cracking the chili crab can be quite messy. The restaurant gives you plastic gloves and wet tissues but I heard that they charge you for the wet tissues so I suggest you bring lots of wet tissues for your dignity."
Excellent food,Beside the price was on a high side. The set meal of 2 with crab was awesome. Every dishes were savoury. Just hope to have 4 instead of 2 fried mantous for a big plate of crab. Kind suggestion to have drinks included maybe.
JUMBO SEAFOOD @ CHANGI JEWEL,We enjoy the food so much at Jumbo Seafood @ Changi Jewel last weekend :) The chilli crab and black pepper crab and lobster vermicelli are so yummy and taste perfect! Service provided by the restaurant is excellent. This is our 3rd time patronising this restaurant outlet and will surely visit again! :)
Food served slightly warm,"Not enough staff. Staff did not come back to me when I wanted to place an order. Food seems to have been left at their counter for a few minutes before serving to my table as it was not hot, slight warm meaning it was left for a while. Cod fish has 3 bones. Did not have a good experience at Changi outlet. ION outlet service is much better."
Good food but lack of staff,"Although the food is Jumbo standards, unfortunately, due to them seriously short of staff, we felt very rush and afraid to ask for plates, fork, etc. which make the whole dining experience really stressed. Please add more staff if you want to maintain Jumbo reputation."
Poor service,Very poor service. Tea was only served after we chased them as main course was already served. Need several chasers before they serve rice and for them to provide us with more gloves. Crab is good but don't think I will be patronising again.
Great food n service,"Was at Jewel Jumbo n was served by Tina Huang a very customer centric, patient n helpful wait staff. Tina made the whole experience wonderful down to the details. Previous occasions, was wrongly charged for food I didn't order n service was so so. This time, Tina made the whole dining experience Jumbo by making sure we are happy dining at Jewel Jumbo."
very satisfying experience,The food was really good. Although the waiting time for some food was longer. The service was soso. I felt that the auntie waitress was kinda annoyed and not interested to serve us...
"Good food, Not very with the service",Foods were delicious. Famous chilli crab. The waiters were not that friendly. They did not take care of us thoughtfully with the price we paid.
Crab and lobster craving satisfied,Three of us shared a scallop with yam as appetiser. The main courses were a 800g black pepper crab and a 1.1kg Australian lobster with rice vermicelli in claypot. All the dishes were excellent. Lobster dish was on promotion - 50% off which is a great deal.
Serene evening birthday dinner ü•≥,Food is very delicious! ü§§ Prompt and good serviceüëç Very comforting and smoothing experience with family. Felt very relaxed and peaceful üòä
Lack of staff,"Severing is very slow as they lack of staff. This is not a good restaurant for big group. All dishes offered has only one standard size, which is different from others Jumbo restaurants"
Great experience,My friends are I enjoyed both food and services. Had a wonderful dinner because of good food. Jumbo never fails me.
Honest Staff From Jumbo,Kelvin is a honest staff who has called me after my payment amount should be 10% lesser. He has refunded me.
Unforgettable Dinner,"I've been to JINBO East cost's main Restaurant in several times, but this was my first time at ChangI Airport JJINBO. I had two kinds of king crab, mini buns, kankong, and seafood assorted. Unforgettable taste and service. And everyone in the party was very satisfied with Tina's friendly smile. Will definitely find it again."
"Food ok, Service was rushed and stretched","Food and presentation was ok. Nothing too fantastic. The portions came really small, and the person taking the order could have recommended bigger portions. Service staff looked really stretched."
Good food and overall experience,"Could never call through jewel jumbo seafood but we managed to change our reservation to 6 pax on the spot right before we went in. The staff were pretty helpful and the food overall was pretty good! Ate the Father‚Äôs Day promotion set meal and honestly, the extra sea bass we ordered with sauce A taste very nice!! Highly recommend that. If there are promotion set meals, I‚Äôd definitely make a revisit."
Great Food. GREAT service by Wai Kin. Enjoyed the Crab without all the fuss of the shell.,Great food. Great service by Wai Kin. Ordered the crab meat n manitou n without the fuss of peeling from the shell.
Terrible food and even worse service,Boston lobster was so small I was sure it was crayfish. Service staff handed me cutlery by hand and asked me whether I needed it. Why is that a question? I had to instruct staff to place it on a plate or something. Service attitude was non existent. The fish and chilli crab was bland.
Farewell Treat,"Service was fast and environment is spacious, very neat and clean. The food was good and I will want to visit again."
Lunch with family at Jumbo Jewel,It has been a pleasant lunch there and the food was very delicious! We would definitely come back again even though the price is on the pricier side.
Great food and one of the best service,"Order a lobster, fried rice, Sambal Kangkong and prawns. Staff was attentive and constantly change the plates for us without telling them."
Insignificant,"Made reservation for 8:45pm without knowing last order is 9:15pm. Arrived at 8:20pm and check availability. Instead of welcoming and assuring to get us our place once it is available, my wife and I were told to come back at 8:45pm to try and last order is 9:15pm.

We don‚Äôt understand what the statement was but clearly Jumbo business is so good, our visit is insignificant."
Biggest crab claw ever!,Deliciously prepared Australian lobster with tang Hoon and the biggest crab claws ever! Cooked with buttery black pepper sauce yummy
Meh,"Food was serve ok, not piping hot and taste was ok. Service was bad, made a reservation few weeks back and upon reaching the restaurant they tell me full house so i have to sit near the entrance which they have to set up a small table and we can only put our bags on the chair along the mall walkway. Terrible! Sauce was knocked and spilled by the waiter but yet he just walk away without clearing the mess. Foc warm water was served to bigger group guests but we have to order upon request. My first and last visit."
Fresh seafood and friendly service,"Loved their salted egg crab. Would be better if I could have the option to decide how the scallops be cooked, e.g. stir fry with asparagus instead of choosing the one from the menu."
Good food albeit expensive,Crabs & fish were fresh and delicious albeit expensive. I gave a 4 star for service as they didn‚Äôt auto change our plates that were full of crab shell instead we‚Äôd to ask for a change. Will visit them again for the food.
Great Service & Food,Food was great and especially the crabs were perfectly done & fresh. Service was great too. I will be back.
Good Service Good Food,The experience was good and the servers were attentive and polite! The food that I ordered taste great!
üòãüòãüòã,Good food and good service üëçüèª Mee Goreng is a personal favourite of mine. Was pleasantly surprised by the Yusheng too! Would come back just for it üëçüèªüëçüèª
Enjoyed,The staffs are nice and attentive. Food is delicious and wonderful ambience . Crab is the signature MUST try.
Tasty Lobster Vermicelli.,Ordered lobster vermicelli multiple times already. Yusheng was fresh n tasty. Far better NUSS. Service was fabulous. Male staff Very attentive.
Great food but service can be improved,We got the the dinner set meal for my hubby‚Äôs birthday. Food is awesome but service can be better. The first serving of appetizer was left behind our table and wasn‚Äôt served to us until about 20 mins later. The waiter apologized politely. Just that we had to gobble down all the subsequent meals as they all came at the same time.
Awesome service,"The staffs are attentive, friendly and helpful. Thumb up for their service. The food is nice tasty and value for money."
Jumbo testing menu,"Food is good, but the food portion is less, not worth for this price. I rather to order a la carte.."
Choice Crabs,"Consistent quality of crabs be it steam, chilli or black pepper. Good service though they can be quite busy at times. Portion and pricing is reasonable. Comfortable seating arrangement as we got a wheelchair member, thanks to staff."
Brilliant chili crab,That was my first chili crab ever! And was brilliant. I made a decision to visit jumbo sea food every monthüòÇüòÇ
Fresh seafood great service at Jumbo Restaurant,"We ordered pepper crab, salt and pepper live prawns, sliced beef snd fried rice. Every dish is on point except for the tasteless shrimp in the fried rice. Service is prompt and efficient. I used their e-voucher with 25% discount."
Disappointment on take-way order - Chill Crab Meat Sauce with Sliced Fried 'Mantou',Take-away order was made for 2 sets of Chill Crab Meat Sauce with Sliced Fried 'Mantou'. The amount of sauce was less than half of its container as shown in picture. Not too sure if this amount of sauce is considered worth of money on its signature dish.
Great fresh crabs.,"Food were great, fresh and delicious. Ordered 2 types of crab. Waited a lil long but was informed in advance. The service staff, Zhi Wei was very attentive. Thank you very much. Rated 4 star instead of 5 only because we weren't quite satisfy with the staff whom took our order. Not only were she not friendly, but she's not helpful in recommending. All else, enjoyed our meal."
Jumbo at jewel,The service and their seafood fried rice was great. The you tiao was not bad too. The staff there were courteous
Great Service & Food,Staff were very attentive in their service and the food were as good as before. Staff even checked with me if I have Changi Rewards card when I totally forgot about it.
Sunday Lunch,Enjoy the Australian Lobster Bee Hoon which is also on promotion.. Good service this time as the waiter kept topping up our tea.. We will be back soon..

Great Restaurant,"Food is great and as always the service is excellent, had a lovely birthday celebration.. Will certainly come back again!"
Just my View Only,"We were happy to be served by Mr Nelson. He is pleasant, professional and our meal was made very enjoyable. This was our first visit to Jumbo Jewel and did not leave disappointed at all esp when it was my God-sister birthday that day. The food were excellent esp the Chilli Crab, Cod Fish and the Baby Lamb rack only the Scallop Ring Yam was a little disappointing. Overall it was a very wonderful night spent at your restaurant. Thank you!"
Good Food with Good Service,"brought my friend who is crab lover to enjoy Jumbo's SriLankar's Crab at Jewel. We ordered 1kg for Chili Crab and another kg for Black Pepper. also nvr forgot to let her try out the Mocha Pork Ribs.

My friend love it and really enjoyed the tasty food we recommended."

Dining Experience That's Simply Wow...,Don't take my word for it. Go try for yourself. Our go to place. Jumbo at The Jewel :) Wonderful experience from start to finish.
Yummy Singaporean-style Seafood,"We enjoyed the chilli crab and the scallop dishes. The Mee Goreng was flavourful, spicy and had a generous portion of seafood. We also enjoyed the scallop yam appetisers - which is a smart play on the traditional yam baskets. Service was also very good."
Celebrate Birthday,"We have a good time eating the award winning Crab, it never disapoint us. The service crews are professional and nice. Ambient is good with enough space to move around and quiet place for us to mingle and chat comfortably among ourselves."
Booking System,"I have confirmed my booking 1 day before the actual date. However, when I went to the outlet, I was informed that the booking has been cancelled. Luckily the staff help me to get a table for my Birthday occasion."
Lesser food options,"Lesser food options here as compared to the branch in East Coast. Also, the chilli crab mantou sauce isn't as good. The fish is decent. Their black pepper beef fillet is tender and great too."
Good service and good food.,"Service was impeccable and food quality was great! However, staff was standing around and chatting rather loudly."
Yum yum,Had a craving for chilli crabs and headed to Jewel to avoid heavy traffic to town on Sat pm. We had the Boston lobster vermicelli instead which was very good. A small dish of chives with mushrooms and scallop with yam paste made it a wonderful lunch. Service staff very friendly and efficient.
Crab lunch @ jumbo jewel,The food is sumptuous everything that we ordered are given promptly. No long waiting time for the food. The people are so nice and very kind to assist you with your needs.
Great venue !!,"Great venue, happen to go Jewel and managed to get a table without any booking, portion are just right for 4 of us. Had Chili crab and is the right size we prefer!!"
Friendly Guest Servers,Their staff are friendly. Explain things in details. They are able to give good recommendation if you are headache of what dishes to choose.
FRIENDLY STAFF & FRESH SEAFOOD,"Enjoy the seafood, very fresh. The staff was very friendly too. Better to make reservation before going."
Great üëçüèª,"At first they gave us a bad location of seat which was near to the entrance
Asked to change to another one
Got a smaller table.
After the third time then they gave us a good one. So happy with the seating arrangement finally!
Food was served quite fast
Everything is good
The best is their service!!!!
They keep monitoring to make sure everything is okay"
Superb Dining Experience for my Family,"Food is superb!

We are able to spilt the menu selection (for the sharing portion) into 2 pax and 3 pax instead of a rigid 5 pax set.

As such, my hubby & me, and my 3 kids could go for the ones we like.

The fuss free chili crab menu is simply great for my eldest daughter and my lz hubby. :-)

Staffs are very helpful and friendly with their recommendations and answering our queries.

Love the ambience, good for family.

The toilet is conveniently located about just 2 shops beside the restaurant.

This is our first visit to Jumbo@Jewel, took us a while to locate the place and we were late, but the staff hold our table when we called.

Thank you!"
Wonderful meal,"Went to have lunch on monday and order thier set meal lunch had marvellous lobster and crab dish, serving was fast and service was great friendly staff and change plates regulary. A must try ."
Praiseworthy Crab Experience,"In search for a crab experience since we recently started working in Singapore just this November, we've tried indulging ourseleves in this restau that is near our workplace. The set meal we ordered we're enticing and sumptous to begin with but when
the recommended chilli crab arrived. It easily took the top of our attention. It is really a must try. Looking forward to try the alaskan crabs on our next visit. :3"
"The chilli crab is good, staff is responsive. Convenient","The chilli crab is good, service is responsive and staff is friendly and will chit chat with customer.
Conveniently located , when you walk from terminal 2, just exit and wah lah, jumbo restaurant. Can take taxi also. The chilli crab is fresh, unlike other seafood restaurant snd theres 10% off now, service is fast and nice chinese tea.
Queue is not long, staff are helpful and responsive. Staff will change plates regularly and apron is supplied, it will be good if got lemon water to wash hand after eating chilli crab"
"Good food, great service","We were lured by the promise of shell-less crabs and were not disappointed by other dishes served, in particular the black pepper beef and lobster promotion. Service staff were very accommodating and friendly."
Good quality,We ordered 4 Fuss Free set lunch. Very value for money. No rush. Must book in advance. Highly recommended.
Anniversary Dinner,We wanted to have a simpler celebratory meal - and chili crab at jumbo came as a great idea. Glad that we did.
set lunch at Jumbo,went for the fuss free crab set lunch. food is quality as usual but set portion is a little too small.
Sumptuous food by excellent service,The service staff was friendly and cheerful. Food was promptly served and food was delicious. I will strongly recommend my relatives and friends to patronize this outlet.
Fresh seafood,The clam is juicy and tasty. The dungeness crab is fleshy and taste fantastic with black pepper sauce. The sambal chilli goes well with the cod fish.
Best Seafood ever,surely my No. 1 choice for seafood in Singapore. Good service and food quality beating the rest of the East coast seafood places
Great seafood cuisines!,"Loved the ambience, quality food and attentive servers. The cleanliness is welcoming and commendable unlike East Coast location."
Birthday celebration,"Went to Jumbo Seafood Jewel for dinner with my family of 4. Our 1st visit there and were impressed with the service as well as the food. Waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and good recommendation. Australian lobster was at a 50% discount at 900gm going for $104.00. Good size for 4 people. Texture was just nice and tasty. Ordered the deep fried prawns with salted egg, mee goreng, soup of the day, chilli crab chunk meat with mantou. All good except the mee goreng which was a bit soggy. Will return again."
Excellent overall experience,"Had an excellent meal here at Jumbo Seafood. The ambiance of the place is good. Food quality was top notch and every dish was delicious. Service was also excellent and they tended to all my needs.

Overall a good place and would definitely recommend the place."
"Excellent service, food and ambience.","The service, food and ambience are excellent! Lunch was very enjoyable at jumbo. The chili crab is so fresh and delicious. The fried mantou are nice and crispy. Love the fried baby squid. The service staff are attentive and efficient. The tables in the restaurant are well spaced. Will definitely return for another meal."
Jumbo Lobster,Good service! Good quality food! Reasonable price! Friendly and helpful staff! Clean environment! Follow protocol!
Excellent Food and Service,"We were there to celebrate dinner and early birthday celebration. The booking was smooth via chope app, and we managed fo used a birthday voucher as i am a jumbo member. We ordered lovely homemade tofu, spinach with 3 eggs, chilli crab and the best cod steamed fish. On top of that, we got chrysantemum tea to wash all that. The staff are friendly and thoughtful, and in the end we had one of the best dinner. Thank you."
Very good service and food is so yummy,"So glad to be able to dine at Jumbo at Jewel again.

Will definitely go back again soon."
Compliment,Service was great as staff are polite and responsive to request . Clean and neat table. Nice environment
Great Cod Fish and Chilli crab,We were there to enjoy the seafood with very generous voucher from Jumbo. It was pretty quiet when we arrived. The service was great and the food are excellent. We were happy with it.
EXCELLENT SERVICE BY MISS,"EXCELLENT SERVICE BY MISS ELLA YU
My family had enjoyed not only a great meal but an excellent service at jumbo seafood restaurant in jewel at the airport. During the payment my rewards point was not captured on the system. Only realized it after I reached home at 11pm. I texted Ms Ella on my problem. To my surprise she responded immediately. She was very helpful , patient and guided me on how to retrieve my reward‚Äôs QR code so that she could entered the points on my spending. Thank you so much Miss Ella Yu. We‚Äôll be back soon. Regards"
great crab,"Only problem was that the claws had not been pre cracked, and only one cracking tool was provided. Otherwise, servise and food was super."
Tasty Chilli Crab Dinner,"While having an overnight layover in Singapore, we were able to reserve a table at Jumbo Seafood conveniently located in the Jewel Shopping Complex adjacent to Changi Airport Terminal 3.

Even though it was a busy night, as expected, the service was excellent and the seafood dinner was yummy. My wife and I ordered a dinner set for 2, which includes the famous Singapore chilli crab and Boston lobster with vermicelli. The crab and lobster were perfectly prepared and really fresh. It's certainly not a cheap meal. But still good value for money considering what one may have to pay to have the same experience in other countries. A great place and experience to enjoy a good seafood dinner if you are staying at or near the Changi Airport."
Decent food but limited choices in the morning,"Jumbo is one of the most popular seafood chains in Singapore, so most of their dishes are sold out at the end of the day. Thus, fresh seafood/meat has to be delivered to each branch in the morning. So, when I ate here at around 1030am, I was unable to try dishes like the lamb and beef, leaving me quite bummed.

The restaurant is more renowned for its seafood offerings, and I was not disappointed. The clams were fresh and the scallops were cooked beautifully, albeit quite thinly sliced.

The service staff were also very accommodating and the entire restaurant is very well-lit. Overall, it was a pleasant experience but nothing spectacular."
Great Food & Service!,We all have enjoyed ourselves at this Jewel outlet. Food & service staff were great! Will definitely recommend to our families and friends...
The Iconic Singapore Chili Crab.,Crowded at peak hours so we went at an off peak time. The Chili Crab was tasty and huge. Priced like an American lobster our was $65 USD. The three of us shared it. You will need extra napkins and wet tissues. I‚Äôm not sure if the crabs are better at a hawker stall but the one we had was delicious.
Don‚Äôt go this branch if you want a nice and relaxing meal,"Booked dinner at 4:30 pm which was the only slot available. At the front reservation desk, the waitress was only interested to ask me can i finished my meal by 6 pm ??

Ordered a total of 7 dishes for 2 adults and one young child and the crab only came last after we finished all the other dishes and waited around10 minutes.

At 6 pm, waiter came to me table and told me to settle my bill first while I am still eating the crabs so I have to clean my hand and reach out for my wallet to get my card! At 615 pm while I was eating the deserts, another waitress came over and told me I needs to finish NOW as someone outside is waiting for my table so in the end we rushed through our deserts and leave the restaurant at 6:20 pm.

That my dinning experience at Jewel Jumbo. If you can‚Äôt finish your meal fast, I strongly suggest that you ban this ‚Äúfast food‚Äù restaurant!"
Excellent seafood! - Famous chili crab,"You can sit on a plastic stool in the street and get the authentic singapore chili crab experience but if you want to eat in a restaurant surrounding then Jumbo is the best place.
We had the medium mud crab - chili crab set lunch with white rice and some Chinese greens. The food was simply amazing.
The chili crab takes 40 minutes and there is always a queue so we booked a table as soon as we had checked in our bags in the Jewel. Drinks are extra from the set menu so the whole thing was a bit pricey by comparison to the street but the setting, the service and quality of food were well worth it.you cannot come to singapore without trying the award winning chili crab experience and this is as good as anywhere to enjoy it."
Jumbo Seafood,"Simply the best seafood you could ask for! The fish, shrimp, and chili crab were delicious! If you like seafood you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
"Fast service, good food","Ten of us came for lunch on a weekday. The restaurant was quite full, lucky we booked in advance through Chope. The food was served fast. Servings were small so we had to order 2 of each selected dish. Good thing there was a CITI promo of $50 off for minimum $200 food bill. We liked the salted egg yolk prawns, bacon seafood roll, mocha pork ribs, spinach & century egg. The braised chicken was ‚Äúmeh‚Äù."
Fabulous,"Great array of super tasty menu for all members of family. Service was top notch and fast! Only had to wait 2min before the first dish was served! The rest flowed in in quick succession. Very attentive and friendly staff. Lobster in seafood rice broth is a must try! My children love the soup also, excellent taste. For foreigners who want great tasting high quality SG food, at reasonable prices and service pampering, it's a must try."
Good Food,My family enjoyed the seafood at Jumbo Jewel very much. Service was good too. Portion are just nice for my family.
