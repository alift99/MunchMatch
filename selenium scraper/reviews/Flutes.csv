Great Food. Romantic Evening,"Enjoy ourselves thoroughly. Every serving is perfect. It was particularly quiet for a week day before Christmas Sunday. Well, no complain."
Great dining experience,Amicable ambience at a historical site. Attentive and stylish services with value good food. Great choices of drink too
Executive lunch was amazing!,"The lunch was great. Immediately when we enter the restaurant, we were brought to our tables and served with smiles from the servicing staffs. The wait for food was reasonable, food quality is good and the price is reasonable as well!"
VGL,very good lunch will visit again great location and special in singapore. recommend to all that like good food ambience and service
Great food and location,Food is great so is the service. Only minor thing is there’s a private function right next to the main dining hall and it affected the ambiance.
Wonderful dining experience,"Had a wonderful dining experience with my girlfriend at Flutes on a Friday night. I loved the aithentic taste and freshness of the food. I especially enjoy the wagyu beef which was tender. I also appreciate the ambience of the restaurant which elegant yet simple. Nested within the Museum of Singapore also adds a nostalgic yet romantic feel to the restaurant. The service by the staff was excellent and they were very attentive and patient. In summary, we had memorable dining experience and lovely evening at Flutes."
Nice food nice restaurant,"Good dining experience. We went for the executive set lunch, the food were delicious especially for the laksa noodles and the beef were nicely cook. Definitely will return. The service was fantastic as well."
Food was below expectation,"My guests had the beef cheek which was tender but a bit bland. The fish was dry and the vegetables where actually sour really not a good combination. The entrees mushroom soup was standard affair the frog legs, interesting but the combination really works. The dessert choc mud cake and mango mousse was okay. Overall, it was pretty average for >$200 lunch for 3 with no drinks. Servings were small, it was not value for money. Just a pleasant ambiance to catch uo with friends,"
Nice environment with good food and service,Service was prompt and good. Food is excellent and value for money. The staff was also very attentive and ensured we have a good experience during the session. Thank you!
Highly memorable experience,"I've always enjoyed my dining experience at Flutes with only one comment - small serves. But was I wrong for the Christmas dinner. They hit it right in all aspects - menu, taste, portion (service and ambience have always been good). It was also value for $ at $128 (early bird special). The seafood - prawn salad, lobster ravioli, fish were done beautifully - light and not overwhelmed with dressing and sauces that would mask their natural tastes. As for the beef wellington, it was done medium and the pastry was light."
Great food and superb ambience,"This is my second visit. Enjoyed my last visit, so i decided to bring a close friend for lunch. We had the barramundi fillet which was delicious especially with the lemon sauce. Great ambience for conversation. Service was attentive."
Excellent,Really lovely food and great value. Thanks to the team for a lovely evening. We will definitely return.
Amazing night !,"My husband bring me there for my birthday and we had an amazing time there. Staff is LOVELY , so welcoming and friendly. We were mainly served by Cherry & Erika and had such a nice evening. The food is delicious, we went for the 7 courses & wine pairing and the wines were absolutely stunning .... It is from far for us the best restaurant in Singapore , best prices for the quality and service you will receive. we were in the terrace which is very charming :)"
Love Flutes,"We have totally forgotten about Flutes, our last Flutes experience was at their old premise. The food during Brunch was simple yet very delicious. Fish & Chips, Grilled Prawns and Salads. Desserts were to die for. Service from Raymond was impeccable, prompt and warm. Thank you again for the amazing experience and we will definitely be back again!"
Lovely dining experience,They have quality set menu for lunch and dinner. I tried a wine pairing this time. It was truly a great experience.
Excellent restaurant,We were stuck in the traffic and late by 14 minutes but the warm welcome was great as we arrived. The ambient was cosy and food was great. Very good wine collection and good attention by the service crew. Definitely will return. Thanks.
Excellent food plus great service,"My family visited for lunch & found the food, ambience & service to be excellent. Great venue for family & business dining. Location is central."
not vegetarian friendly and no wow factors,"Firstly it's not vegetarian friendly. Even though it has a separate vegetarian tasting menu it's only 5 courses and the meat/fish one is 7!!

So my friend had 2 more courses than me which is just bizarre. I asked them if they could add two courses and despite their only being 4 tables full the chef said no!!

What kind of service is that?

They eventually added the cheese course at extra expenses and I got extra wine for another course!

Very strange.

Secondly the food I got wasn't actually that nice and left me hungry. It was ok but nothing special.

My friend's fish/crab/chicken dishes he said was lovely.

So this is clearly a place for fish/meat eaters not vegetarians.

The other strange thing was that we had win matching but all the wines were white, why no red?"
Excellent dining experience,Had a great time spending my anniversary there. The dinner menu is great with the wine pairing and service is excellent
Lunch among old friends,Excellent Food and Service. Will return with other friends nd relatives to introduce the restaurant to them.
Easter Brunch,"What a beautiful location. Formal. Prime Rib roast dinner, would’ve liked a little more gravy (they ran out). The roast beef was excellent as were the Yorkshire puddings, no potatoes was a disappointment. Flan was a little runny and the strawberries were old. Otherwise very nice lunch."
Hidden Venue,I have satisfied not only high quality of dishes but also excellent service by staffs. I would like to invite my family next time.
Topnotch Food and Service— Must Visit!,"After scouting for several restaurants to celebrate our anniversary, we chose Flutes as the venue. We did not regret the decision. First and foremost, I have to commend the impeccable service rendered by Juan and Bing. Upon entering the place, we immediately felt the warmth and friendliness of the them. They were very professional and I must stay made our anniversary celebration extra special. They both are knowledgeable and have explained the every possible detail of the food that was being served to us. They are absolutely an asset to the Flutes team!

Now talking about the food, we had a sumptuous dinner. From the appetiser down to main entree and dessert, I would rate it as 5-star. Foie gras is a must-try! And the dessert was definitely tasty!

If you guys are looking for a place to celebrate special occassions or lunch/dinner, I highly recommend Flutes. You will not be disappointed.

Kudos once again to Juan and Bing!"
Excellent Sunday lunch outing,"It was the highlight of our Sunday - lunching in this very pleasant high ceiling roomy restaurant with white table cloth, fine dinnerware and impeccable service. With the excellent food at reasonable prices it is difficult to fault this lovely place."
Excellent Tasting Menu,"It was an early birthday celebration for a good friend. We had the 7 course tasting menu which was delightful. Fresh ingredients, well presented and explained by servers with attentive service.

My good friend was impressed with the recommended Chardonnay for our meal. We are looking forward to visiting soon."
Very good indeed,"Everything about the lunch we had here was first class. the food was well prepared and did not try to over-complicate things while remaining contemporary. The five course meal we had at lunch was perfectly proportioned and each dish was as good as the last, something that is quite difficult to achieve. We had an excellent bottle of wine which while quite a splurge was priced very keenly for Singapore, there are some real treats in this carefully selected list.

This was our first visit to Flutes and we are very keen to return for Dinner to see how the space changes with the time of day, at lunch it was light and airy it ill be interesting to see the dining room and indeed the menu at night."
Great place for lunch and wine,I booked a lunch for two to celebrate my wife's birthday. First impression that still lingers on our mind was the warmth and excellent service. The food were as nice as their wine selections. I will definitely try to bring my colleagues and friends for lunch or for a night of classy drinks after work.
Small portion dinner,Dinner menu items looks nice but portions are pretty small..like a dish with one prawn with some corn.
Great place to celebrate special occasions,Food is great. Service is superb. Ambiance is nice - great place for our wedding anniversary Celebration. ❤️❤️
Dinner,"Like the atmosphere and the staff services. However the requirement that everyone in the party has to select the same 5-course or 7-course menu is overly rigid, unhelpful and not in a right spirit of customer service."
Wedding anniversary,"Sent my parents to Flutes for their wedding anniversary. They were extremely pleased with the service offered from start to the end. The food was amazing too. Overall, Flutes offered an experience I would consider one of the best in Singapore."
"Great Ambient, Food and Services","Went to Flutes for a family event and we were absolutely pleased with the overall experience. The ambient was great, customer service was top notch brilliant, with the staffs catering to our needs (we had two kids with us) all the time. Food was served rather quick as well and was amazingly delicious and presented with the right portion. Kudos to Flutes and the entire service team. We will certainly patron Flutes again for future events."
"Very good , great value for money","Went to Flutes 2nd time . First one was for lunch sometime ago , was great then decided back for dinner . Ruth from host department deal well with booking and followed up about special requirements etc . Nice place care about booking. Restaurant like always clean and having friendly service staff . Was Thursday so place was not busy ( I was actually happy about that as everywhere in Singapore those days is super busy and everything is just rushed )
Dinner menu is option of 5 or 7 courses tasking menu ( I was aware about menu as host send copy of menu prior visit) . Went for 5 courses with a few modifications which was hasselt free from staff . Very nice . Service stuff done gone job to reconfirm all order . I like ambiance there and also food was very tasty . Ever place are not too busy feel like they still using premium product and focus on freshness of food . Really enjoyed every course and time of service . Wasn't too slow or too fast , ever we was last table some point they still not make us feel time to go .....
I think make some promotion on that times and maybe smaller or cheaper tasking menu could attract more customers just to keep a business going . Anyway def recommended and would like to back again. My experience are just positive , keep going guys , thanks for great evening to whole Team , front and also back of House ."
Flutes,Lovely setting and ambiance. Service was of a high standard too. Food and wine pairings worked out well. An enjoyable evening had.
Our Excellent Wedding Experience on 26th September 2020,"We hosted our wedding at the Flutes Singapore despite this pandemic period on 26 Sept 20. The coordinator Ms Joanne Ang is excellent in her Quality Service to aid us throughout the planning to actual day. During the fine dining session for the guests, special mentioned to Ms Cherry Chai, Ms Joanne Ang, Ms Rachel, and Mr Sourav for their excellent service. I would strongly any couples who wish to host your wedding at the Flutes Singapore. From the ambience, to the quality of food , to the services provided by the resturant.. it is definitely world class experience. Thank you for giving us such a memorable experience for our wedding. From Bennie and Wendeline."
All perfect!,"Martina and I would like to thank the Flutes team for helping us celebrate a magic wedding on the 10/Sep/2020. Everything went well and smooth, even better than planned or imagined. The staff was kind, attuned to details and seemed to be enjoying the evening with us. Every request was attended with courtesy, speed and a smile. The food, of course, was also a highlight, together with the decoration, ambiance and some specially tailored drinks.
In special, I want to praise Joanne for setting the evening for success. All the way from the start of our planning, she always communicated with us very quickly and clearly. Joanne showed positive attitude and flexibility to accommodate our requests, some of them were last minute changes (like a belated RSVP just 3 hours before the dinner) and other unusual ideas (like the special Brazilian and Czech drinks).
This is an evening that we and our 38 guests will always remember."
Excellent Dinner Experience,"I booked Flutes for dinner with my husband, Service was exemplary from accomodation of special diet, flexibility in personalising menu, food quality and overall ambience. It is really great value for that price point. Highly recommend the restaurant."
Not a suitable restaurant for celebrating birthdays,"We celebrated our son’s birthday on 15 Aug. The dinner set was ok but not “wow”. Obviously needs more improvements. For fine dining experience it’s sliced truffle used for the steak has no taste. Likely to use Low quality truffles. Should use truffle oil instead to bring up the flavour if that was the intent. What makes the dining experience terrible, in the context of Asia, when someone is celebrating their birthday and a dead flower was placed in a glass on our table as part of table decor. Goodness, please pay attention to details, can? This isn’t Jollibee restaurant. We asked the service staff why was the dead flower given to us when we informed the restaurant in advanced that we are celebrating our son’s birthday? The reply was “the flower is part of the decor and it was fresh when they placed it there.” What a brilliant reply. In gets better, when they delivered our 3 desserts which was part of the set to make it look like a birthday cake, we had a good laugh. Even hotels or even today’s hotpot restaurant are more than willing to celebrate diners’ birthday better than this place. We ordered 3 sets (even though our son is 7yo & do not have a big appetite) & not 2 sets shared by 2 adults n 1 child. This place isn’t welcoming Nor do they know how to make their guests feel welcomed. They just left the desserts on the table n walked off. Coming to This place once is enough, I can better use my hard earn money to dine elsewhere who will make us feel welcomed. It’s a pity this ‘high end’ restaurant do not really train their staff well."
Special Chef Dinner Menu Five Courses Set Meal,"Due to the pandemic, they did not have ala carte however they had a Special Chef Dinner Menu set that offer five courses. The service is top-notch, food is really delicious but proportion wise is pretty small, like French dining style so we were not full even after the five courses. Hope to see a slightly bigger proportion."
Fantastic birthday treat after lockdown,"Wonderful location. warm, attentive and truly excellent staff. Fabulous atmosphere- full restaurant and everyone looked to be having a similarly great time. Fantastic set menu and wine with it! Can’t wait to go again and already telling lots of people how good it is!"
Restaurant is nice just some dishes need to be improved,"Restaurant is nice with both indoor and outdoor options. We went there because we saw lots of good comments from them and have to say they did very good service, however, food is bit lower than expectation. Currently they only offer dinner set menu at $88++ per person, have to say the food was not bad but scallops was bit too salty and if there was other choices I would order other dessert instead of existing one"
Great service and ambience,I went to Flutes with my girlfriends for our regular gathering. Staff were attentive to our needs and service was brilliant. The food was absolutely delicious with the right portion size. My friend forgot to mentioned that she was her beef well done and they replaced it completely with a new dish without question to our delight. We will certainly be back again when the ala carte menu resumes!
Simply Delicious,We had the Taste of Flutes menu. There is not mmuch ch to say but yummy!! It was well composed and the courses were not overloaded so you felt just fine after.
Outstanding food in a wonderful restaurant,"The food was delicious, well balanced and beautifully served(what you would expect from a high end Singapore restaurant) and the restaurant setting was superb as well. Would highly recommend."
Quality meal at the National Museum,We had a real good dinner here. Good diverse al a carte menu and a short but high quality wine by the class list! The scallops and lamb were great and so were the other dishes. Service friendly professional and attentive. Recommended.
Cool relaxed vibe and simply delicious food,"We've been back on a few occasions and the quality has been pretty consistent. We particularly enjoy their brunch offerings, although limited but the execution is spot on. It's really a combination of elements that makes flutes a good experience each time.

Superb that it's located in the majestic National Museum. Servers are mostly polite while the nosh is consistently satisfying. It's a lovely way to start the day off on a good note.

Now if they could get a little more creative with desserts, they'll have us camping out here every other weekend."
Quality Dinner,We entered this restaurant after visiting National Museum of Singapore. It was already around 6pm and it was a bit cumbersome to lol for a new restaurant. We could get seats without reservation. The atmosphere inside was nice and it turned out that they provided quality dinner. We enjoyed scallops and asparagus as starter followed by lamb and pork. Wines served there were also awesome.
Dinner celebration,Services and food are excellent. Cozy environment. I only informed was a birthday celebration and to my surprised they gave me dessert with a candle. Foods are delicious
Nice ambience,"Have our team lunch before Christmas, thought will have great experience but nothing too fancy! Limited choice of main course in set lunch, my Friend have to ‘anyhow’ choose as really nothing much else to select."
Nice ambient and decorations,"We chose flutes after doing researches and surveys for our anniversary venue. We are thrilled when we arrived at such a beautiful restaurant. I brought along a bottle of wine for the dinner.

I am surprised when we arrived at the restaurant, the receptionist, did not offer to keep the bottle for us, as well as ushering us to our table. We have to talk to the server to look for our table.

We are further disappointed that only limited Tomahawk steak is available in a day, and which we intended to order that for us to share. We are not aware that reservation for the tomahawk is necessary as we thought this is quite a well known restaurant.

At the same time, there was a private event going on the private room. As we were served with our mains, we are surprised that the meat served are barely warm. Hopefully, the restaurant can improve on their quality control over the food.

Last but not least, we were given a complimentary dessert for our anniversary. Overall experience, i would give it a 4.5/10 as a good restaurant like Flutes certainly have some standard to keep up and maintain with."
Great!!,Great service from the moment I booked the restaurant all the way till the end of our meal. Drinks are a bit pricey though.
Couples,"Ok where to start. This place is just inside the front door to the National Museum of Singapore. Setting is great nicely laid out dinning room has a good ambience if you will. They had two menus, a la Carte and a 5 course tasting menu with matching wines, we went all in for the tasting many and wine. Simply put we were not disappointed food was good, wine good, service good, value for money good and environment good. Worth a visit."
Elegant,Had a colonial feel which was accentuated by nuanced service and delicious cafe food. Loved the interiors.
Still hungry.......,"Located within the grand ambience of the National Museum, Flutes does serve good food which is beautifully plated. Service was very prompt and non intrusive. Only wish the portions were bigger"
elegant colonial,"Nice, elegant, fine dining restaurant, located inside the National Museum of Singapore. Western kitchen served in a very bright and well decorated, yet lean and warm main room which you feel the comfort. This good ambiance is accompanied with a terrace for perfect coctail hours."
Lovely brunch,"I visited flutes after touring the museum in Singapore. Flutes has nicely arranged rooms in the historic building. They offered a alacarte brunch menus for european or asian taste. The food was fresh, plates nicely presented, attentive staff and a quick service. A place to come back to!"
This is not what it says it is.,"Prior to our visit to the museum, we needed some lunch away from the usual heat and humidity of Singapore. Lured by a sign that claimed Flutes was air-conditioned, we approached.

We were sat down in a plastic semi-enclosed, outside area, (no choice), that had a large overhead fan. How this rated as air-conditioning I am not sure. The waiter asked for our order before we had time to decide, so we asked for some water while we made our choice.

I have never been out to have a meal at any establishment where four glasses of water cost nearly $10. Were not told that it was not complimentary, only to discover this rip off when the bill was presented.

Given that the meals were nothing more than over-priced snacks, the venue was not enclosed to offer genuine air-conditioning and the wait staff were impatient and unfriendly, I would rate this venue as the worst experience out of nine countries we visited during our holiday."
"Good food, excellent service",I had dinner at this restaurant last night. While the menu looks similar to the menu they have had for some time it has been revamped in the preparation etc. The dishes seem more subtle and full of flavour. From starters through main courses and desert all the dishes were excellent. The scallop starter was exceptional. They also have a very good wine list and the sommelier is very knowledgeable. The venue in the National Museum is of course very good. If you are looking for a pleasant dinner with a nice quiet ambiance and good service; this is the place for you.
Exceptional food!,Flown from Australia and booked this restaurant for my partners birthday as I celebrated mine here in June and was so pleased with everything so I had to come back. Outstanding food and service.
Perfect for Business Lunch!,"Fantastic beautiful place! perfect for a business lunch! very well priced set lunches, with fantastic knowledgeable wait staff Will be back!"
Miserable Serves,"Great ambiance, great service, good wine list and great tasting food. However the servings were so small we left feeling hungry and ordered room service from our hotel to ease the hunger. This was our 3rd visit to this restaurant and unless they increase the food portions will be our last visit. It's a ripoff and would not recommend it to anyone."
Beauiful setting,"We ate a delicious lunch here. The setting is gorgeous, with true hospitality from the staff. Just be sure to dress nicely or your might find yourself sitting on the terrace with the other American tourists."
A little disappointment,"Was informed at the very last minute that there wouldn’t be ala carte menu available, as they would be serving night festival menu instead. Whole place was quite chaotic (outside of the restaurant). Wasn’t served any birthday dessert as well despite putting in remarks during reservation. Food was good and staff were attentive. I would return if ala carte menu is available."
Everything was exceptional,"Celebrated my birthday with hubby there today, the ambience was fantastic! Romantic setting with great service, service staff pulled my chair for me to sit even after I came back from the ladies. Food was delicious, service staff smiley, tables and space between other tables is spacious. We will definitely be back! The scallops and wagyu beef was to die for. Oysters so fresh they melt in your mouth!"
Exceptional service and great food!,"We booked lunch here to celebrate my husband’s birthday.

Right from answering all of my queries via email to accommodating my request for a special dish for my son (which is not on the menu!) to preparing a surprise for my husband to closely attending to us during our meal - hands down for their exceptional service. When we arrived, I did not have to ask about my requests, they have it all figured and planned out. They noted everything and attended to the tiniest details, something that is very rare on restaurants nowadays. I do hope that all restaurants follow on your footsteps.

Food was great! Serving may be quite small for other people but we’re not big eaters so it was just nice for us. My son finished his fish too, which does not happen often!

Had a great time and experience here. Thanks Flutes! Keep it up!"
Great service and food,Our family enjoyed the brunch especially the Sunday roast. The service was excellent and we would love to come again soon. Thanks Flute!
Well done,"We had lunch here whilst visiting the museum and were so impressed by the food and the service that we had dinner that evening. On the way to dinner we managed to get lost coming out of the metro and ended up half an hour late. However, the staff were unfazed and very polite and we had an excellent meal in a beautiful room."
I will visit again,The food was nice and service was excellent. Elegant restaurant in National Museum. We spend good time there.
Birthday,"Disappointing lunch. Expected more with so many good reviews.
Nothing special about food. Duck was slightly tough, and nothing special about the flathead. Food portions were small.
Staff taking reservations are well trained. Sherry even checked and got back to me about availability of parking lots.
However despite giving name of Birthday celebrant, the did not prepare the dessert for her as promised."
Another lovely Date Night,"Left the place with satisfaction and nothing but good words to spread..

We were at first surprised with the “peacefulness” in the restaurant and was afraid to be disappointed with the food.

Absolutely wrong first thoughts..

Manager and server were especially friendly and amazing. Recommend dishes for my vegetarian husband and my pescatarian self.

Meal started with a complimentary pea soup.

We were very pleased with the starter and main course.
I had scallops for my starter and the Barramundi for my main. Superb!
My husband had roasted pumpkins(sides) made into a starter and the Burratini as the main. He is absolutely pleased with his food too!

Will definitely return!"
Amazing service and food,"Food was pretty good and reasonably priced. Very attentive and meticulous service and the environment makes it a very suitable place for couples, family to hold events or special occasions. The only downside is that they don't serve their a la carte menu on weekends. Will I return again ? No doubt I would."
Wonderful Restaurant,"Great restaurant in a wonderful setting. The food was sensational, wine great as was the attentive service, everybody could not do enough for you but they were not over attentive. We ate there twice during a 6 day stay. Fabulous."
Mothers day brunch,no parking available!!! no a la carte menu welcome drink very nice in house artist very nice touch sharing first course average to good main dish too small but taste is good (fish) sharing dessert was average service/captain was excellant
Awesome service and tasty food,We received excellent service from Mr Ali and the rest of the crew the moment we entered the restaurant. Food wise... equally good
Excellent Food and wine,"The menu is well crafted and the food was very well prepared and tasty. Coupled with a good selection of wines , this is a great place for a lovely meal"
Flutes,Atmosphere would have been excellent if not for the group booking and we had to be seated in a quiet room. Appreciated the complimentary entree and dessert from the chef though.
Dining Elegance,"WE had the pleasure of dining at Flutes in the National Museum - the food, service and ambience was superb. I would highly recommend the set lunch menu which was excellent value for money. I will definitely be back again."
Not bad at all!,"Enjoyed most of the food. Nice ambiance, good for dates. But do expect it to be a little pricey though."
A beautiful restaurant with excellent food.,My wife and I dined at Flutes for an anniversary dinner. It is an upscale beautiful restaurant. We both had lamb which was exquisite. The service was impeccable. We would certainly recommend it for a special occasion.
Roast Beef Sunday Lunch,"I was looking for a restaurant that would be serving a Sunday Roast and was recommended Flutes.

Very enjoyable indeed. Roast Sirloin of Beef was cooked Medium Rare and was tasty and tender. Excellent selection of vegetables including a cauliflower cheese. Requested some extra potatoes; no problem. Additional gravy, no problem. Service was attentive and unobtrusive; thank you Juan.

Dining alone from a corner table, provides an excellent view of the restaurant. The service team is efficient and tight. Well done, I will return. Recommended."
Good dining experience,Great ambience and service We gad the 3 course set lunch Mains were a bit dry (beef brisket and snapper) However Lively plating
Outstanding Cuisine in a Gorgeous Setting,"We opted to enjoy the Tasting Menu with wine pairings and it was fabulous! The presentation of the food was beautiful and everything we had was perfectly cooked and delicious! The portions were not so huge that we regretted the choice of the tasting menu but it was plenty of food. At SGD $160 for the five courses of food with the wine pairings, it was very fairly priced given the quality and portions we were served. The only thing we could not understand was why the restaurant would not have been packed on a Saturday night because everything about our experience would highly recommend it. Service was very efficient and the meal was perfectly paced."
A great dining experience!,"From the moment we arrived the service was impeccable as was the food. Everything was presented beautifully and tasted fantastic. Despite not having a sweet tooth, we did not want to miss out and the team organised a medley of desserts which was much appreciated (and well worth it!). A great experience all round!"
"Excellent food, excellent service","We booked flutes for our 1rst wedding anniversary and we were absolutely happy about everyting.

Delecious tasting menu, high quality of service, nice atmosphere.

They even prepared a nice surprise for our anniversary as you can see on the photo below. (chocolate dessert offered).

We would definetely recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Special thanks to the amazing Chef and all flutes team."
Lovely place,"Had our weekend brunch there. Ambient is good, service is great, food is good too but too bad quite limited choice. The staffs are baby friendly."
"Refined, perfectly cooked","Quality ingredients, well balanced seasoning, perfect cooking, tasty sauces. Good choice of wines. The service is impecable, no long wayting between dishes. The place is beautiful. I definitely recommend this place for a couple dinner or with friends."
Definitely come back again!,"Set dinner is reasonable priced, surprised us with good warm food. Servers are hospitable. Its hard to find good food with good servers and ambience."
Great ambience,"They serves great brunch menu, food quality is fantastic and superb desserts. Spacious ambience where you find peace."
Lovely Anniversary dinner !,"My husband had reserved a table at the Flutes restaurent for our anniversary dinner, the first after our baby arrived. Lovely ambience, delicious food, nice music and they also gave us a complimentary dessert :). The staff was very nice and had saved us a private corner for the evening !! We had a wonderful time and will definitely be visiting again :)"
Excellent food,Excellent food and service in a cosy and elegant setting. This is one of my favorite places to dine with friends.
Our SG trip’s most memorable highlight,"Booked a table for our anniversary dinner. The food, and the people at Flutes made the experience truly memorable. From entrée to dessert, everything was beyond our expectation. Also noticed that most of the staff are Filipinos, i like it! Thanks a lot to Bing and Juan for the great service. Thanks Flutes SG for that unforgettable experience. Until our next visit."
Enjoyed our dinner,"Excellent food, good service, impressive Victorian ambiance. It is not very clear when they have menus and when only a la carte, but we really enjoyed the a la carte menu this time."
A magical night,"Everything was absolutely perfect, from the frendly and professional service to the impressive meal presentation to the quality and taste of the food. I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone ."
Quality restaurant in every respect,"We booked for dinner for 4 on a Monday evening. No views but a beautiful building. Good ambiance and a warm welcome. Surroundings and decor is classic and stylish without being too stuffy. Service was attentive. Not a huge wine list but a good selection and affordable, although both the white and red wines we selected were unavailable... the good thing was that the alternatives offered were terrific. Food was also of a very high standard. I had the 5 course set menu for $85 which was almost sensational and overall VERY good value. Other guests had three courses and were equally impressed. The excellent service was topped off by the staff waiting outside for the taxi we ordered to take us back to the hotel. The outside courtyard looked nice although was not open the night we were there, could be a great venue for lunch. Overall a really nice restaurant and one that we would definitely come back to. The long walk to the toilets and the location / surroundings were the only real negatives."
Lunch,The food and service are impeccable at this lovely restaurant. The set lunch menu which we chose was extremely good value.
Business dinner,Lovely restaurant to bring overseas guests to and the whole atmosphere in and around the Museum is unique. Very welcoming staff with high knowledge of food and vin. Not over crowded so time for all the guests. Thanks for a great evening.
The Restaurant for all occasions,"We've been dining in Flutes since we got married there in 2007, and have to say that their current chef has taken the food to the next level up. They know how to do classy well - from deco to service to the food; even for a lazy weekend brunch. Their to die for braised beef pie was just the perfect size; as was their side of yummy mash and beautifully presented buttered peas - with their smoked salmon brioche toasties and prawn agile olio coming in a very very very close second. And their desserts are a must try - their sticky date pudding is on par with its creatively presented pear and apple crumble, and with its chocolate matcha fondant tart - which by the way, was specially plated to welcome us back - yes, they still knew we've been going back since having our wedding there; though we'd not breathed a word of it!
Perfect food with wonderful service in an elegant setting - definitely worth coming back again and again.... makes us think of having a wedding there all over again!"
First Class,"Exceptional service coupled with excellent cuisine!The Flutes set menu was both innovative,well presented and had our taste buds hopping!Well done to the chef and staff we will be back when next in Singapore!"
A great evening at Flutes,"I had a wonderful dinner with my wife at Flutes. The ambience was great and the service excellent. The staff were very attentive and they took pains to find out what we thought of the dishes. The presentation of the food was very good and the taste, delicious. I liked the foie gras and it was one of the best that I've tasted. Good dining experience. Will certainly visit again. To further enhance experience, perhaps Flutes could consider having more than one variety of beef and to provide complimentary parking for guests."
Great good and service,"Visited as a guest in the Flutes restaurant for dinner with friend last Thursday. We love and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere in restaurant. I just want to say that, in addition to a nice meal and desserts, we had a delightful waiters and waitress. They had just the right balance of friendliness and efficiency. They made certain that we had everything we needed. Kudos!"
