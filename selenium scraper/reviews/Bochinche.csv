Awesome Steak!,"We had the following for starters:-
Galician Octopus A La Braca, Truffle Potato Foam, Cancha Corn, Sun-Dried Medley Tomato
36 months Cebo De Campo Iberico Ham, Sourdough Focaccia, Sweet Onion, Criolla
For the mains we had:-
Black Label Argentine Tenderloin 600+ Days Grass Fed
Murray Cod on The Bone, Roasted Parsnip & Chestnut, Fried Sage , White Mushroom Gravy
For our sides, we had:-
Creamy Tuscan Mushrooms, Mixed Greens and Charred Padrón Peppers.
We had a Carafe of Luca Old Vine Malbec Vintage 2018.

We were very impressed with the starters and the steak. We felt that it would have been better if the Cod wasn't deep fried. The wine was also very good.

Overall a very nice place to enjoy steak at a reasonable price."
It's alright,"Went on new year eve, ordered a few starters but all of them were served at the same time, and there is only 2 of us so was a bit hard to ingest.
Ox tongue katsu is nice and soft, goes well with the sauces.
Ceviche is a bit dull and flat, need some kick in it. Fish does not smell very fresh also.
Beef is ok."
Fabulous service and great food!,"A great service given by all the staff , always checking if any client needs anything.
Incredible tastes! Great beef with Argentinian sauce! The wine was aromatic and fruity. The beef empanadas were the best starters. And finally the combination of ice cream with crunchy nuts was delicious."
Lunch,Limited lunch sets selection but value for money. All four of us took the aged beef. It was done to perfection for our medium rare.
Not worth your time and money,"Ok food terrible service. We were being chased out multiple times despite spending close to $200 per pax. We would understand if it were a full night but the fact was there were lots of empty tables!! There are much better steak houses with great service to spend quality time, dont waste your at Bochinche!"
Great Steak and Solid Service,"Had dinner on Friday night. Not only was the food awesome, the service staff especially the manager did a great job recommending the right food for my friends pregnant wife. Really enjoyed the dinner! Highly recommended."
Enjoyed every course,"The hamachi was spot on. The empanadas wasn't really wow. The meat board was the best decision ever, particularly the beef filet. The leanest of all. The dessert - creme brulee is must try! Everything was nice and worth the experience."
Absolutely Awesome!,"Despite the busy fintech event, the staff was attentive and interactive. The food was delicious, and when one set of beef was over cooked, they replaced with no questions asked. Only thing is the wine list needs to be updated. The wines I wanted to order only had 2020 vintage instead of the published vintage."
Awesome Argentinian dinner experience !!,Very nice ambience and crowd. Awesome food. Super yummy beef Vintage Galiciana. Very friendly and helpful staff and restaurant manager. Will definitively come again after I save up for more good steaks 🤩🤩🤩
In love,"1st visit and definitely not the last. The beef is good, paired really well with the Argentina red wine. Will be back again for more protein!"
"Hands down one of the best steaks in Singapore, not insanely priced and run by a great team who look after you","Superb steak, stellar service and a beautiful wine menu. The food at BoChinChe is so well done and reasonably priced too"
One of the best steaks I've had.,"The restaurant was exquisite, very clean and pleasant to the eye. Staff were very accommodating. The steak was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and tasted amazing. The sides were also great, chili corn and chips with light covering of cheese."
Corporate lunch at Bochinche,"Came in for a corporate lunch with some international clients. We all got the set lunch, everyone enjoyed the steak, the pea tarte did get some interesting looks as a giant salad but tasted great. Flan was a great end to the meal. Only slight issue was that the restaurant was slightly challenging to contact to change time of visit as Chope only allowed certain seatings."
Dinner,Food was not satisfying for the price. The only good thing about this resto is the service. Steak was bland.
Excellent steakhouse,The steaks and overall food was perfect and tasty. This place great for friends gathering and hangout.
Inconsistent,"Bochinche used to be a regular favorite of ours (nearly twice a month) many years ago when it was at Martin 38 and then in Amoy Street.

They used to have good food and wine with friendly service.

I’ve visited the new location twice recently. The place lacks the energy it had and was not full even post Covid.

The service of some staff was arrogant and erratic. The service let the whole experience of a good value lunch down.

Loyal customers are those who sustain restaurants through thick and thin. But it’s more than just the cost; it is about the experience.

Sorry but I won’t be back again."
"Lovely juicy steak, fantastic service","Lovely juicy steak, fantastic and attentive service. Wine of the wk a bit sub par but overall great experience. Will definitely come again."
Great Service but average overpriced steaks,as above... Nothing much more to say than the service by the Albanian manager was fantatsic. The steak were overpriced vs Quality and taste... Dessert was good
Best steak ever,"Excellent service staff. They know their food well and will ask regularly if you are okay. Steak is one of the best I have eaten and it isnt Wagyu. Definitely worth the price.
Their melted cheese platter was awesome but watch out for the calories as it is dripping in oil. Get their Signature Bread. Dip it in their Charcoal Butter and melted cheese. Heavenly.
I would come back again.
Value I have to be honest. It's definitely not cheap. But not like Wolfgang Puck price. So I will only come back to celebrate occasions. Not a weekly dinner."
Love it!,"Smoky flavourful steak is not something I can easily recreate at home so if that’s the case for you too, come here! Great service to boot!"
25th Anniversary Lunch,"Celebrated our 25th Anniversary there. Didn’t get any wishes nor complimentary dessert / drinks. Food is average, but we only had the set lunches, so not sure if a la carte steaks taste better. Service is a notch above average i guess. Manager did check in with us if we liked the food. Service staff were attentive enough to constantly clear our plates and top up water. I think for the price of set lunches, i would go back, but probably not for dinner at their a la carte prices."
Disappointing,"The food was quite expensive vs the quality / taste.
So was the wine (Saint Joseph 2017, 175 SGD), very average.
Overrated vs quality and vs previous experience in 2016.
Service average (nice waiters, but asking too many times if everything was ok)
Atmosphere: very silent, no particular atmosphere actually."
We enjoyed the food,Food taste is unique and delicious. Service is good; prompt and friendly. The Pan Seared Halibut taste really good and fresh. The Beef Fillet Steak is flavourful. Happy with all the food we ordered.
Great food and service !,"Appetisers and sides such as the mozzarella, asparagus are just amazing. Steak was also very juicy. Fries are to die for."
Severely underwhelmed - do not recommend,"I must admit I was quite underwhelmed by the service level in general. The food was good, but service from first hello to course selection and a wine guidance was major under par. Will not come back nor recommend unless told otherwise. Sorry to say, and probably lots of reasons for it with covid and all - but they are effectively all suitable excuses only for lower tier restaurants, albeit not for what you are aiming at?"
Used to be better,"Hadn’t been for a year and since it’s relocation to Club Street they no longer had the tomahawk steak which was disappointing. Cocktail list was quite limited. That said, rib eye fillet and octopus dishes were very tasty."
Rotary grill Argentinian,"Never had a steak grilled on rotary, medium done is almost well done, too dry. Kitchen had a fire incident thereafter. The cauliflower dish was interesting, with pomegranate, pesto and pine nuts. Empanadas were just too tiny. Jamon balls were tiny as well. Red wine (Pinot noir) was delicious."
Very nice steak,"Bochinche has a very good steak, service and a nice casual environment. The lunch menu is quite well and fairly priced"
Something got lost from Robertson,Food was so so. Acoustics is crap. Service suspect. Not going back even if someone is picking up the tab.
very good service and food,first of all this is a straight up steakhouse and we are vegetarian. :) but we had a great time and there was enough of a selection to not worry about cuts of meat. the ambience location and service of this place is absolutely fantastic. the staff make you feel truly welcome. drinks are amazing too :) will be back !!
Mediocre food,"Brought our friends here for dinner because we had a great experience the last time we visited. We asked the server for recommendations and ordered everything that was recommended. The starters - Bomba Arroz Verde with Argentinian prawn and scallop tartare ($27) came with 2 tiny shrimps and I don't recall any scallop, just some risotto-like rice in green sauce. Pulpo A La Braca ($36) had meagre and small chunks of octopus tentacle spread out over a watery potato mash. Subsequently, for the mains - the Meat Feast ($240) had four different cuts that were all chewy and tough, even the Rib Eye cut was not enjoyable. We gave feedback to the server that the meats were not great, and when we paid, we were offered a stack of Citibank vouchers ($8 discount for $40 spending, one voucher per use). When we ask what we would do with so many vouchers, the server told us to give them to our friends... haha. I thought the gesture was in poor taste. The dinner bill was almost $800 for 4 persons, disappointing to say the least and definitely overpriced for the quality that was delivered."
Excellent service,Left a comment that it was the lady’s birthday when I booked. They surprised not only her but me too when they provided a candle during the dessert as i did not pre-arrange anything with the restaurant.
.,"Nice place and food, just that it was slightly noisy due to the lunch crowd. Mu family enjoyed the meal."
Food still good but impractical layout,"The lunch set remains a great choice and value supported by above average food that provides a great introduction to Argentinean food. However, it's a shame the new restaurant location and layout just is impractical. A long hallway from the front section to the back dining area, waiting staff congested in this bottle neck and the dining area being a massive warm echo chamber. It's a shame that the homeliness of the older location has been lost. This is a good example of increased size not equating to better."
"Good food, good service",Everything we ordered from the starters to sides were good. Beef is the highlights but the quail starter was a nice surprise. Also recommend the broccolini side dish to accompany the main. The Malbec was to die for.
A bit average all round...,"I love a good Argentinean restaurant - the meat, the atmosphere, the exotic flavours, count me in... BoCHINche was a bit limp in all respects and disappointed on the whole - the empanadas are served plain on a plate, no sauce or dip or garnish which is missing the chance to celebrate a real Argentinean food wonder - the empanadas were tasty without being world beating but something to go with them would have made the dish more complete. The steak was fatty and gristly, not as much meat as hoped, too much sauce drizzled over the top rather than offered on the side and the potato wedges were under done and crunchy... Come on team, you know you can do better than this..."
Great Food! Thanks Shwan.,We had a great meal and catching up with friends. We were serve by SHWAN and all staff are accomodating. Value for money for food is top. Would recommend to my friends as well.
Lacklustre experience,"For that price, we did expect a lot. One of the waitress really didn’t know the menu at all. We had asked her what’s the dessert and she just repeated what was stated in the menu without explaining. The pigs ear wrap is not appetising and very piggy. Food was served VERY fast. Our alcohol was not served before all our entree was served. Had to inform the staff not to serve the mains until we have finished our first round of drinks. Prob our only visit there. Better places around."
"Average food, poor atmosphere","No social distancing between tables, regulations were not followed. Mingling was allowed across two tables."
"There are better steakhouses, defo not for business meal.","My boss and I were at Bochinche yesterday evening. We had an amazing Malbec and empanadas, average steaks and a bad experience with a service staff. When I first arrived and asked where the washroom was I already sensed that our attending male server did not like us. Extremely arrogant and very little eye contact (yes even when I asked where the washroom was). The restaurant got more crowded during dinner and most tables got louder for that reason. That same male staff came to tell my boss off and told him to quiet down, as he told my boss that my boss could not even hear him and had to make him repeat so you could imagine the restaurant was petty loud overall. So if my table is too loud, I noticed a table of 4 near the washroom were also having a great time audibly (no fault of theirs as I said the restaurant was loud, you have to be louder to be heard). i felt like the treatment was not consistent because that table had foreigners so they were not shushed. This made me feel discriminated as an Asian. Since we are too loud for the restaurant and we could not hear ourselves, I strongly advise NOT to choose this spot for business meals or team gatherings.

My first and my last at Bochinche."
Amazing meat,"For anyone looking for juicy, tender and tasty beef meat, I have good news: your search is over: Bochinche is THE place to go. The staff is very friendly, the place is warm, designed with style and the food is absolutely fantastic.
We will come back, hungry for more."
Asados Argentina,Celebrated my lovely friend’s Birthday at the venue. Grilled meat was perfectly done and services was excellent! Will definitely be back again.
One of the best steaks we ever had,We are in love the steak and this is one of the best steaks we ever had. The service is good ..we were sitting at counter seats and the chef was so friendly and recommended us some nice dishes
Extremely noisy restaurant with nice deco,"Was there on Friday evening, the restaurant was fully packed. First time visit this new premise after they shifted from the street behind. The decoration is warm, modern and cosy but sadly the ambient was destroyed by noisy diners and loud music. The vibe was bad while the waitress are short handed to offer good services to everyone.

The food was decent and with good selection of wine. Personally I prefer the menu and the quality of the food at previous premise. We spent about $130 per pax just with a bottle of Malbec sharing by 5 of us. Unfortunately, the mood was right for us to carry on with more bottles."
Business Lunch,"Fantastic food, friendly service, great wine list recommend the meat feast, plus aged rib. Some teriffic malbes and rioja in the cellar too Friendly relaxed service - not pretentious Second visit looking forward to my third."
Empanadas are a must try!,"We had the 3-course set lunch and selected the empanadas, rib-eye and dessert (cheese and tres leches milk cake). The food was great and we also ordered a bottle of wine. I enjoyed the corn empanada a lot. Service was prompt and good. The only downside was the music was very loud and we can hardly hear each other talk. The ambience was a bit noisy and it was difficult to have a nice and quiet conversation."
Thoughts,"I brought my hubby to Bochinche for his birthday celebration and was informed that they could only served Dessert with a candle. Kinda disappointed but nonetheless went for it. I personally love the food served. I ordered the beef fillet and requested for medium rare. Perfect! However, I feel that the service and ambiance can be further improved.

Service:- I would say average for the price we are paying. Price comparable to spargo and service i must say there’s a vast difference.

Atmosphere: The conversation from the next table could be heard. Echo was too loud especially when you have a huge group gathered.

My 2 cents worth: go for the food, but if you are looking for a place to chill, not the most ideal or romantic place to book."
Amazing steak,"Must be at least fourth trip here, both the old venue and the new place which has the same great atmosphere and awesome open grill. Mix of more delicate dishes like the prawn and scallop on risotto rice, and then big flavours on amazing charcoal rib eye. Honestly one of my favourite place in Singapore. Chef and bar manager always there to speak to about food and drinks. Enjoy!"
"Excellent service, atmosphere, food and value! Definitely recommend!","Excellent service, atmosphere, food and value! Really great place for a business lunch or a social catch-up!"
"Good food, service and ambience","Had a thoroughly enjoyable dinner experience here. The steaks were well grilled and the charred on the outside. The wine recommendation was excellent, and service was good. Prices are abit steep but well worth the experience."
Excellent Service and Food,Thanks Roy for making our wedding anniversary special. Excellent service and wonderful food. We will definitely be back again.
Amazing food and service,Had a wonderful time at this restaurant. Food was amazing (flavourful and well portioned). Service was impeccable. Would definitely go again.
Disappointed,"It was my 10th wedding anniversary. Went on a weekday afternoon and the place was quite crowded and noisy. The staff got my steak doneness wrong. I wanted MW but it came as MR. It was sent back to the kitchen. When they sent it back to me, the staff did not ask me if the doneness was right. It was WD... overcooked. Ordered 2 wines and both weren't good too. The rest of the food were okay."
"Third incarnation, a disappointment.","The third incarnation of this ‘Argentinian’ restaurant was a huge disappointment. It has lost any semblance of the authenticity it had previously and the new venue and decor is soulless ( COVID accepted). Sorry Bochinche , but the spring rolls were bland, the empanadas nothing like the delicious ones you used to make (and certainly nothing like those experienced in Argentina) and the steak bled out on the plate. Even molten cheese failed to impress. Service was alright but being unable to split a bill more than two ways seems amateurish. I loved sitting at the bar in the old venues, maybe that is the key. The company and wine were great!"
Great Argentine food experience for a birthday,A new location from when I first spotted this place. Have been hanging to try this place for a long time Provatala is one of my worlds fav dishes
"Disappointing- salty, chewy and expensive","We ordered the octopus, provolone and bread to start. The octopus was nice but the bread was rock solid and the provoleta was underwhelming. For mains we had the strip loin and the rib eye. The strip loin had a lot of flavour but the ribeye was over salted and very chewy, despite being cooked as recommended by the chef. We were sat in front of the grill and watched the chef skewer several steaks back together with a stick after cutting them to check the doneness and put them back on the grill. I don’t know how they have a chef that doesn’t know how to cook steak properly. The service wasn’t much better; we had to remind them to bring the one glass of wine we ordered and other items they forgot. Really wanted to like it but it was hideously expensive for something we could do much better at home."
Great Argentine Steaks - a real meat lovers place.,"My regular venue for steaks, I mean real 300gm charred juicy steaks. The hanging steak and Sirloin were my favourites, same with the Ceviche, Empanadas, and wine. Service was par excellence, always listening and super attentive."
"Decent time, can be improved","Pros: waitress provided excellent service throughout the night
Cons: ribeye as part of the 'feast' dish was not good, rest of the food was okay. Also Bochinche called me three times in 15 minutes to confirm my reservation earlier in the day - I was in a meeting and could not answer. When I complained to one of the staff when I arrived at the restaurant, he was dismissive and unapologetic"
Fandabidozi Bochinche!,"Great ambience cozy setup, attentive and food knowledgeable team they have coupled with amazing food they serve that sums it all!"
Our 'go to' restaurant,"The food and Chefs are outstanding. The flavours are perfect;y balanced. We especially love: Starters: Pulpo from Galicia - so tender, Burata with tomato juices Mains: twice charcoal cooked steaks - incredible flavour. The burger is to die for! We are fans"
Underwhelming Sgd70 300g beef,"Underwhelming Sgd70 300g beef fillet recommended by the waiter as the ‘signature dish’. It was tiny, dry and tasteless. The beef foie burger was way better. It was a birthday celebration (written on the note), there were not much value added or delightful moment, I had to remind staff… they only provided a candle. The customers next to our table were very loud and distracting, I’ve signaled to the waiter, no action from them. I had to confront them myself in the end. Wasn’t a great experience from price point to the service provided."
Value for Money Meat,"Went with friends for dinner last Sat. Was really looking forward to the Provoleta but unfortunately was already out. We ordered the beef tartare and burrata instead and those were really good to be fair. Still want to have the Provoleta next time as I had a really good impression of that cheesy dip and would've wanted to try again.

We had the meat feast for the main and it was really good value for money. It has Argentinian sirloin, ribeye, fillet as well as lamb chorizo and spiced chicken so there's options for everyone. The whole thing's about 1.3kg and was the perfect serving size for 3 hungry boys (myself included coz I eat like a man) and 1 not so hungry girl. We also tried all the sauces - chimichurri and horseradish stood out for me but the rest were not bad either. The flavour of the steaks was really good with the right balance of meatiness and smokiness. They tasted good even with just salt and even better with the sauces. My friend who's a steak snob was a bit disappointed by the doneness though as he wanted medium rare but the steaks were cooked more towards medium well. I didn't mind though and still happily ate as much as I could.

We also ordered the broccolini and heirloom carrots as sides. Great accompaniment to all the meat and also very well balanced in flavour.

For dessert, we had the dulce de leche donuts and the tres leche cake. We super loved the donuts. Best ever with the cinnamon sugar coating and the smooth caramel sauce. The tres leche cake also wasn't bad with a really moist texture and yummy milky sauce.

Highly recommend this place. Best value meat platter for an almost fine dining experience."
Beef tartar a must try,"We were a group of 6 colleagues, majority of us 1st timers and we had great evening. we had meat platter, steak was great, we don’t need any dips. The grilled chicken was also good. Even bread basket was good.
I was apprehensive about beef tartar as my colleague said it’s raw beef... what a pleasant surprise! I love the tangy taste and it’s just heaven with toasted flat bread. I think I can just have that all night. For dessert, we had this caramel condensed milk ice cream, reminds us of horlicks ice cream... what a great way to end the evening, good food, good service."
Argentinian night,"It was really a great evening at Bochince. Food was, as always delicious, from the starters (empanadas and provoleta) to the main courses (I took the Ojo de Bife, medium-rare). Amazing the fact that we could order also a good Fernet con Coca-Cola to digest (typical argentinian).
Amazing experience. Will be back again for sure."
Taste of real beef!,"For beef lovers, especially Argentinian beef. Charming restaurant bustling with lots of people in animated conversation.
Starting with fregola with scallops and prawns which was so delicious, and the side dishes of broccolini and creamed spinach were also extremely good. Prices are high here, eg ribeye steak 300g was S$60 and sides and deserts (like chocolate fondant) are about S$19 each."
Great steak and empanadas,"Satisfied with the dishes we ordered, especially the pork empanadas and aged ribeye steak. Charles, who was helming the bar, was very friendly and gave us a good experience overall. Will be coming back for the dinner menu!"
SUPERB!,"we went for the set lunch. the steak in the set lunch is excellent quality and tastes superb! all the items were great and highly recommend the 3 course set!

fantastic value for lunch . the ala carte is also a good menu but much more expensive in comparison but having greater variety. the restaurant recommends the prime rib for sharing."
"Delicious food, great service and an amazing Chef!","I took my fiance there for a post quarantine dinner and we were lucky enough to immediately see the Pulpa being prepared for someone else so we ordered it. It was truly amazing, the octopus was cooked perfectly and the cornichons were a delight and even though there was truffle which my other half hates, we both agreed the entire meal was a 10/10. We also enjoyed the fillet steak and brocolloni followed by the doughnuts in dulche de leche. This was all washed down with an amazing Organic Cab Sav. Needless to say we will be going again oh and we loved sitting at the bar watching our meals being prepared!"
Underwhelming Argentinian steak (ribeye),"The review is solely based on the ribeye steak ordered as other items (empenadas, croquettes, and burger) were quite good despite the small portions - for meat lovers, I would advised not to order this. I requested for a 300 gram ribeye steak medium but when it came it looked charred and relatively small (did not look like 300 gr) with black charcoal burnt all over the steak and it might be more towards well done as the meat was not that pink when cut into. At $60++, it was not a good experience and value."
Great food and service,"Responsive staff, even though Bochinche was crowded at lunch. The lunch set is excellent value with the Argentinian steak - wonderfully seared - with Provencal-styles potato wedges. Better than steak-frites. Croquetas passable, octopus pretty good. The lamb chorizo was the star - full of meaty chunks and served with.. anchovies! Cocktails were pretty good too. Definitely coming back."
Their Beef Tartare was Amazing!,"My best friend and I were seated at the bar and recommended to try their Beef Tartare with daikon, pine nuts, mayo and soy-glazed egg yolk). It was a great suggestion from the bartender who took our order - in fact one of the best tartare I've ever eaten! The steaks were cooked to perfection. Their chimichurri sauce paired very well with the steaks. I'd love to try their set lunch menus soon!"
Excellent food and service,"We visited the restaurant for lunch and enjoyed the food immensely.
The set lunch is great value for money.
We had empanadas and salad, followed by fish as the main course and then pudding and cheese for dessert. Absolutely everything tasted divine.
The staff was super friendly and accommodating. We had our year old daughter in tow, and they were very good to her too. This was great, given that the restaurant is not geared to cater to tots (no high chair- we were informed in advance).
Overall a great experience."
Easily the best steak in Singapore,"Great food from starter to desert. Equally great,service. Interesting wines that offer introduction to good Argentine reds and whites. Thoroughly enjoyable dining experience"
Superb food and service,"This was our second visit to a restaurant serving world class food and has a waitstaff that is friendly, attentive and helpful. Easily the best steak in Singapore and we have added the grilled octopus and the pear tarte tartin to our must haves.

A most enjoyable evening and we look forward to our next visit"
Simply delicious,"Though I’m not a beef eater, I must say that the beef tasted really great! Wonderful place with a fun atmosphere & great customer service."
Surprised Discovery,"We have never been to the restaurant before and were surprised how good were the food. Rib eye steak was juicy and tender. But nothing beat the Dover Sole. Given the border closure around the world, my wife and I have been going around Singapore searching for good food restaurants 2-3 times a week. This is one of the few gems we came across. Unpretentious and just good food to enjoy."
Enjoyable experience,My husband and I went for a date night to try a new cuisine. The food and the ambience sitting at the kitchen bar watching the chef and his assistants make the food was superb. I learned a lot about how they flavored the food. The burrata with pumpkin was the best.
Food was good. Service not much,"The food was good, place is nice but the service was slow and we were asked to leave after 1.5 hours. It’s odd and although we are living exceptional times restaurante are places where people shouldn’t been ask to leave."
Unprofessional and childish way of service,"Have chosen Bochinche for my annual catch up on 23 Dec with my culture-loving ex-NASA buddy.

Looking forward to the catch up so was careful in choosing a right restaurant and reviews for Bochinche were mostly positive and it’s Argentinian! We were really excited.

But was met with disappointment.

Foodwise was ok, not mind blowing but quite unique. We so wanted to like this quaint little place but the Unprofessionalism and childishness mean I will not come back and will unfortunately not recommend Bochinche:

1. Reservation

35 mins before the lunch appointment at 12 noon, the restaurant called me and said I must return the table by 1.30pm. I was appalled and needed an extension and the service staff said we can try but no guarantee.

When I reserved the table 2 weeks earlier, nowhere in the reservation or email did Bochinche specified we can only eat for 90 mins.

Considering the price of the location, which I believe was so as they believe in quality service, it would have been respectful to inform your guests about the time limit at the start of the reservation process i.e. during online reservation and not 35 mins before the lunch appointment, so that I would have time to consider other restaurants for our annual catch up - especially during the peak Christmas season.

2. Service was unprofessional

In the entire restaurant, we were the only table with the service staff chasing after us to order. All the while standing beside us.

As we settled for 5 mins, and was still considering the menu. He already asked “are we ready to order?” And displayed impatience when we asked questions about the food.

The second course, steaks, took a while to serve and halfway eating, he came to us and said we have to leave in 10 mins because we agreed to - which I never did on the phone!

I was actually quite amused with their courage to muster the rudeness to hurry their guests to finish their meal.

3. Asking for the bill

At 1.35pm, I indicated for the bill. They cleared the table but the bill never came till we asked again 20 mins later.

In that 20 mins, perhaps they misunderstood us hogging the table but in fact we were waiting for the bill, the service staff started banging around the cabinets near us. This is unbelievably childish and not professional. But frankly, was quite funny to watch the behaviour.

All in all, the whole experience was amusingly distasteful at Bochinche. As it was unexpectedly childish and unprofessional.

Dear Bochinche, if you overbooked your restaurant, it is your responsibility to manage the situation and not your guests’. By selectively hurrying your guests during their meal is not acceptable, and I believe is not the Argentinean way of hospitality"
Great Great Restaurant,"Our fav restaurant in Singapore. The staff are great and hate to single anyone out as all staff are great, but Fabrice (Head Chef) and Dominique (Matire D) are engaging and outstanding. Very accommodating on food frequents. Just love sitting at the Chef's counter and watching and engaging with all the Chefs as they produce your meal. Consistently top notch food."
A cosy restaurant with great service,"We were seated at the bar seats in front of the open kitchen. It was fun to see the chefs at work, coordinating the orders and doing quality checks. The waiters were attentive and friendly, the food was great. All in all, an awesome experience."
World class Steakhouse,"Easily the best steak I’ve tried in Asia and rivals the best steak houses in the US. The Argentinian beef that was expertly charred was superb.

My guest and I shared an assortment of empanadas and the ceviche - both excellent.

The wait staff were impressive. Lots of restaurants have friendly service but this staff is knowledgeable. We asked if the ribeye was large enough to share and the waiter said he could increase the size to whatever we wanted. Clear;y this wasn’t a precut frozen portion... he the asked if we wanted the steak sliced

We left the restaurant feeling upbeat - a nice feeling to have in the COVID environment"
A lovely time,"From the moment you enter you know that this will be good. The open kitchen set up and the bustling ambience is the perfect set up for a great meal. We had the seats at the bar, and was so well taken care of. Food is excellent, combined with a lovely recommendation for a bottle of red and finished of with a tasty dessert. The service is spot on, the waiter was very prompt and contributed to making it a lovely time."
"Great ceviche, delicious beef despite being a challenging times to be operate a restaurant","I had only heard about Bochinche at the start of the past week and I decided to take our group of 5 people on Friday evening as a bit of a punt and I am happy to confirm that overall, we were not disappointed.

Obviously, social distancing measures are being hiked to new levels in Singapore at the moment and with a number of establishments having lost their licenses to operate over the past couple of months, the threat of punishment is clearly at the forefront of many restaurant's minds. So while a waiter is required to greet you with a mandatory message about not removing masks until you have at least a glass of water in front of you, I do feel that it was a message that could have been delivered in a far more courteous manner than the 'greeting' that we received upon arrival on Friday. Ultimately visiting restaurants is about experience and this was a literally terrible start to the evening, slightly deflated, everybody duly agreed to follow the rules and like naughty (fully masked) schoolboys, we were quickly taken to our table. Not the start that we had expected or hoped for at all.

Gladly, things did get better (once the water was in front of us and masks could be removed at least!) but then took a bit of a turn when we discovered that a pint of beer at Bochinche costs SGD 30. This is pushing it even by Singapore standards, luckily, we weren't planning on focusing on drinking beer but I suspect that that kind of a mark up is unlikely to please very many guests.

Those points aside, I am happy to say that the waiter was great overall and everyone really enjoyed the rest of the evening at Bochinche!

Choosing to share dishes between the 5 of us, we started with a variety of empanadas, lamb sausage, octopus and a couple of rounds of the ceviche. Everything was great and that for our table, we universally agreed that it was the ceviche with pickled onions and fish roe that was particularly special.It was really, really good in fact.The octopus was nice but the accompanying escabeche was far, far too sweet for all 5 of us. The lamb was nice but nothing particularly special, gladly, the empandas were very good, so a slightly mixed start but thanks to the red snapper ceviche, it just didn't matter!.

We then opted for the John Dory, a 300g rare Filet and a 300g medium rare Ribeye, some side dishes and with a couple of bottles of (far more reasonably priced) Malbec on the table, everyone was in heaven. I can confirm that the filet was delicious and judging by the expressions on the faces around our table, everything else seemed to hit the mark.

So all in all, we really enjoyed Bochinche and I will look forward to bringing more groups in the future, I just hope the the welcome from the front of house team will be improved dramatically before then."
Great food!,"Highly recommend the food here, visited for the first time and will definitely be back again. The Argentinian Rib Eye was a particular highlight!"
Steak Sth American,"Having tried most steak places, we expected Bochinche to be a typical Brazilian affair. It was a welcome surprise to find something different and uniquely Argentinian. Meat was grilled perfectly. Ceviche and Chorizo Croquette starters also wonderful. Well worth a visit if you like meat. Not a great place for Vegans"
Excellent food (the steak,"Excellent food (the steak was awesome - always trust the chef’s advice about how it should be served) and excellent service. The mango parfait was also delicious, especially the ball of coconut heaven it came with!

Not cheap, but worth every penny for a special treat!"
Fantastic food!,"A wonderful dinner experience! Very nice food , rather on the pricey side. but totally worth it. We loved everything but especially the Dulce de Leche dessert was AMAZING! we will definitely go back to this restaurant."
Good but service needs to improve (maybe it’s because of the CB times),"The environment is great, the two servers a were so nice but not enough for all the tables...
the steaks flavors were yummy BUT the meat has a looot of fat ...
the empanadas are tasteless, so I ordered a salsa (which you have to pay extra! Never seen an Argentinian place where salsas aren’t part of the table) and the worst is that the salsa took 23 minutes to get to our table... so, by that time my empanada was more than cold...

Prices are good, midrange"
Excellent food and service,Had a nice cosy dinner. The food was unique and flavourful. Service excellent even though there were only 3 persons taking care of the many tables. Highly recommended!
Frens Catchup,"Great ambience & service.
The appetizer was pleasing to the eye and a generous serving of salmon with a tasty salad at the side.
The main dish was ample and done as desired though in hind side would have better as a medium rare dish.
Dessert was a crowd pleaser and gobbled up as soon as it arrived.
Overall a pleasant lunch in a great location"
Overpriced and way too disappointing,Food was very disappointing as we ordered the ribeye and it was way overcooked. There was no truffle taste to the truffle fries. Not recommended.
Overrated!,"Ordered ceviche as starter, rib eye steak mid rare and the truffle fries.

Ceviche was alright, nothing amazing for the price.
The steak though was really underwhelming. For sgd$69, it is not worth the money. It was over done by alot.
The truffle fries had no truffle taste at all. Just very garlicy. I don't get the good rating.
The service was not bad, very eager to clear the plates thou."
Nothing special and overpriced,I read some reviews that this place was nice. Unfortunately I was not particularly impressed. Took a while to be served and then when the food arrived these were quite small portions. So I was not overly impressed considering there are much better options around in Singapore!
Staff did their best to earn the poor rating,"I had 3 main issues with the restaurant...

1. Too eager to clear plates. On more than one occasion we had to ask staff not to take away unfinished plates. Restaurant was hardly full so we should not have been rushed.

2. Staff consistently over-poured wine glasses killing the wine itself

3. Staff insisted that a voucher issued in Oct 2019 valid for 3 months was invalid and continued to do so in front of my guest. When he eventually realised he was wrong he did not admit his mistake nor the decency to apologise.

Steak was what you would expect from a steak restaurant. Atmosphere was ok."
Dissapointing -- lost its mojo,"We have been to Bochinche in this new location several times. The atmosphere is nice, however the last couple of times we could not help but notice a steady decline in the quality of the food and in the value for money. It is definitely not a cheap restaurant. A typical full meal with appetizer, meat, desert wine and coffee will set you back at least between 180 and 200 sgd nett per person! Specifically, while the dessert was ok, the house bread and butter were dissappointing, the empanadas unremarkable, the meat very salty (see other reviews) and undercooked, and side dishes (brocoli this time and the parmesan fries the previous time) unedible (hard, cold, or undercooked). We sent the dishes to the kitchen for correction and they sort of obliged but at some point we just gave up. At this price point this is simply unacceptable. I am Argentinian and was really looking forward. Left very dissappointed."
Great food and service - a must try!,"Invited some guests from Australia to dine at Bochinche. Service was great and attentive, explaining to us the specials and the different cuts of meat available. Starters were great but the meat is the star of the show. We had the Black Onyx Sirloin, a Ribeye and the beef & bone marrow burger and all were fantastic."
Superb,Great food. Nice presentation. Good selection of wine. Perfect for a celebration. Will visit again for sure
The BEST for me in October!,"I visited at least half a dozen eateries this month and this one STANDS OUT!

Tucked at the end of Amoy Street you may miss it however once you step inside for sure a second visit is a must!

The interior with the music and ambience is perfect for Argentine food. Great ambience for couples dinner.

The house bread and Empanadas were out of this world. Worked up our appetites and we ordered Pork Chorizo Sausage,Wagyu steak aged 31 days and Grilled Chilli Thyme and Oregano marinated chicken with sides of sprouting Brocolli.

Bravo Chef!What a wizard!

I will return for sure!

Cheers
