Excellent location and good food,"We sat outside in the garden and it was a very nice evening. We had three different rillettes and the escargots as starters. Very good! Waitress found us a bottle of our favorite white wine although it was not on the wine list anymore. Good service! The lamb shoulder was very tasty and smooth inside (cooked sous vide) and after some minutes under the grill crusty outside. Veggies were good as well. Yummy! Summary: a lot more choices on the menu as for example „Pucks“ at MSB, good service, good food and wine at high level for reasonable money, relaxed atmosphere. A good choice for lunch and dinner!"
Good food let down by the service,"The menu at Atout is small and we didn’t find it exciting, but it did feel like comfort food.

It seems to be an increasingly common local phenomenon in Singapore that restaurants charge like fine dining without offering the service that should come with those prices.

Our evening at Atout was like that. The restaurant wants to be “casual” but that crosses over into “sloppy” when the service staff aren’t quite sure what they are doing. When we had questions about the menu, our server had to call over a colleague to answer them, and a request for drinks and condiments during the meal was forgotten and we had to repeat it when the waiting had gone on too long.

When you are being charged for a “butter degustation” to go with the bread that you are also separately paying for, that shouldn’t be the way. Either you are providing the dining experience that matches your pricing, or you are not. We felt that Atout was not."
Fine Groceries and Delicious Food,"I found out about Atout, one of the few grocers who carries Kampot Pepper, and so I'm off to check out this place.

Smoked Salmon Rilette with Mixed Greens & Pickles is full of colours and flavours. The tanginess of zucchini and carrot refreshes the palates while the greens is crunchy and full of flavours due to zesty seasoning oil drizzled over it. I'm not exactly a salad person but this salad wins me over. Salmon rilette has that subtle distinctive flavour of cooked salmon, and this subtlety is exactly how I like it. The pink peppercorns sprinkled over this spices things up. A well-executed dish.

One of the perks of dining here is that bread and French butter are included in the set lunch because the warm bread with soft fluffy interior is delicious. I can actually finish the whole lot of them, whether with butter or on its own. What is even better is that the French Conviette butter given is oh so amazingly good. Within the buttery, super creamy goodness, there is a very light hint of citrus, which refreshes the whole taste of the bread. This is so good that it is totally worth it to come to this restaurant to dine just for this butter.

And extra information: this butter is certified AOP (Appellation D'Origine Protégée), meaning that it is a unique quality product produced with au naturale ingredients, strict standards and specific methods.

US Kurobuta Pork Cheek braised in Red Wine, Carrots, Mushrooms and Potatoes is such a hearty treat. Generous portions of tender, gamey meat and potatoes will delight Braised Meat fans. The pork is so tender that I can use a spoon to lightly scoop out a chunk of pork. Unbelievable. Obviously, lots of effort is put into making of this dish to make the meat so tender.

I love Valrhona Dark Chocolate 'Nougat Glacé, Almond Tuile because not only it is good, full of the intensity of quality dark chocolate, and the texture is so unique. It is slightly sticky and chewy, just like chocolate nougat. I'm surprised by how good chocolate can be when in chewy form. To make it even better, after a few chews of the chocolate, it melts into chocolatey goodness in the mouth. This change in texture is interesting and for practical purposes, it does not leave chewy bits in the teeth. Almond Tuile is a nice complement to the chocolate to add the crunchiness texture and nutty flavour to it. This creation is another one of those desserts that I think deserves a special trip down to try out.

The place is of stylish interior with dark wood framing the full length windows overlooking the lush greenery outside. This is perfect for an idyllic day out for families, couples, friends. The service is very good and attentive, without my prompting, they automatically come up to clear the plates, fill up my glass with still water and even clean up the water spilled by me immediately. Extra compliments to two young service staffs: an Indian guy and a Chinese gal, I didn't get their names though. All of them are very friendly, and the dining experience here ends on a good note with the guy at door bidding farewell.

I like this restaurant a lot. In fact, I prefer this place over another one of similar concept (dining + grocer) due to the extensive menu, unique creations, the value-for-money set lunch and good service. This is a great place to recommend for gatherings and yes, even for solo outing to just enjoy nature with the good food."
Reminded 4 times before next seating!,"The food was ok. What made the dinner experience extremely unpleasant and distressful was that we were reminded to leave four times before the next seating at 8pm – first upon arrival, second and third throughout the dinner, and finally at around 7:50pm, we were shocked to be presented with the bill.

Before 7:50pm, we were asked what dessert and drinks we would like to have. We ordered a Crème Brûlée and two pots of Earl Grey. When we were presented with the bill shortly afterwards, we were under tremendous pressure to consume all that we had just ordered including our leftover wine in 10 minutes.

There were guests at two other tables who were already seated before we arrived, and it was puzzling why we seemed to be the only ones targeted to struggle with our dinner. The high frequency of interruptions to our dinner was very disruptive to our conversations. In fact, this was the first in my life growing up in Singapore where I have received 4 dinner deadline reminders before the time was up.

We also noticed at the end of the dinner that not all ladies were given baskets to put their handbags into. The lady beside our table had her bag placed on her laps all throughout her dinner, while ours were placed on the back of our chairs which could not prevent them from falling off due to the open backrest.

By the time the bill was presented to us before 8pm, we had already lost our appetite. We obviously could not finish what we ordered having to deal with the continuous stress that made our stomachs a little sick. At around 8:30pm, there were a handful of empty tables, and that made us wonder more about why we seemed to be the only ones pushed.

The manager came over to apologise about the repeated reminders to leave and offered to waive off one pot of earl grey.

Yes, one pot of tea.

Not only will this compensation of tea not bring us back again, it is a shame that we will not be able to recommend it to our friends. We left with an awful memory of what happened at Atout on a Friday night.

This is definitively not the service standard of a restaurant – a French restaurant. There is certainly a lot of improvements the restaurant has to look into if it wants to maintain good class service and remain competitive in the market."
French for asset,"What used to be Le petit salut is now Atout, though the chef is the same i read

Pleasant ambience with the garden and greenery outside, outside seating too, if not too hot

We had the set lunch, priced more reasonably than dempsey cookhouse. Starter of heirloom tomatoes was fine, can’t screw that up. My pasta was overcooked and limp. Dessert of truffled brie ok

Service ok

"Excellent food, patchy service","We had dinner at Atout on 5 May 2022 to celebrate a very special occasion.

The French onion soup must be the best in town, and the 500g “Pepper Crust” Angus beef ribeye with brandy sauce was so good that the 200g chargrilled beef tenderloin with Hollandaise sauce paled in comparison to it. In other words, if you love beef steak, go for the 500g ”Pepper Crust” ribeye. You only live once.

The beef tenderloin was served with mashed potatoes but the “Pepper Crust” beef was served on its own without any sides. So the salad we ordered was a necessary accompaniment, but with hindsight, the potatoes as sides weren’t necessary, as we were already very full.

I can’t remember what we had for dessert. Probably a molten lava chocolate cake or something.

Truth be told: We had really looked forward to the evening as it was a very special occasion. Also, we had to cancel our reservation a year ago due to the pandemic (in quarantine and I was so very disappointed then!). The food was excellent and the ambience was really lively, p-a-c-k-e-d with diners who included regulars. But the service was disappointingly patchy, which is why I’ve given it 4/5 stars. Our experience was somehow marred, and strangely (or tellingly) I don’t have any photos of our meal.

Will I return? Perhaps. Because the beef was really, really good. But I think we’ll try other restaurants, and return to the consistently friendlier ones before returning again."
Burnt my tongue,"Visited on 21 June 2022. Soup was served boiling hot without warning. Staff didnt warn about it, first sip after blowing it a few times and my tongue got scalded really badly.

Horrible service. No follow up no apology no ice until I pressed on and wanted to complain."
Very good food,"Been here twice and enjoyed myself both times. The food is very very nice and we order the 1KG tomahawk to share with sides and a wonderful selection of wine to go with the food.

Reasonably priced and the outdoor area is not too hot during the night."
Missus’s Favourite Lunch Place,"Once again, had a great lunch here, coupled with excellent and super friendly service. We loved the rillette starter, with the delish fresh bread. The Toulouse sausage was tasty, as was the squid ink pasta. The dishes were also well presented.

And we ended the meal with my favourite dessert of truffled brie with fig jam, and the chocolate roll. Drinks of lychee and lime, and expresso, were okay.

Do take the time to check out the shop upstairs, where you can find good vinegars and peppercorns, as well as a great selection of wines, gins and even Atout’s extra virgin olive oil."
Lovely evening spot,Came for dinner in my first trip back to Singapore for two years. Enjoyed Pate and Rillettes to start. The rillettes were so good especially on the gorgeous French bread. Pate's were also good quality. I would have been happy to have eaten these through the evening. We didn't though and each ordered the most delicious sausages to follow with two bowls of chips. Fantastic!!!
Great Lunch,"Had been here a few times and find the food pretty good. Did not do any review but decided to do one because my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the dishes and service this afternoon. We had the 3 course lunch special. The Burrata with heirloom beets was an excellent dish. The beets come in 3 different Colors and it was yum. The steak was cooked nicely but I had their signature steak with crusted peppered was more delicious. My wife had her steam barramundi with heirloom carrots. She mentioned the fish was a little bland in taste but the carrots was tasty. For dessert I had the Valrohna chocolate log which tasted great, while my wife had her pear and marron log. It’s Christmas so everything in a log! Francis provided excellent service. Friendly and always wanting to explain the food. We were given a table facing the garden. It was not a hot day. Overall very pleasant meal and environment."
Excellent Lunch,"Back here again to celebrate a birthday lunch with the wife. Unfortunately, due to the Covid restrictions, only two of us could be present.

The meal was excellent and the service was friendly and warm, as always. Chef Patrick was on hand to greet several old customers, and even delivered the birthday cakes to our table.

We started with the country style pork terrine with chestnuts, which was tasty. My wife thought the piece was harder than normal - perhaps it could have been taken out of the fridge a little earlier. We both loved the braised Kurobuta pork cheeks, which were delish and fork tender.

The warm chesnut cake with vanilla ice cream was good, but the teuffle brie cheese was superb, especially with the fig jam.

We brought back two extra cakes - blackforest and hazlenut stack - and the blackforest was particularly enticing, with its rich and bold flavors and liqueur-soaked cherries."
Quiet place for working lunch,"Came here for a farewell lunch with a colleague. Set lunch $42++ is a good deal, you get bread basket, appetiser, main and a dessert. On weekdays, it's pretty quiet which is v conducive for conversations. After our lunch, I had a 1hr conf call, so I took it from the restnt, staff didn't chase me, and people thought I took it from home bec patrons were all spread out so there was no background conversations, and neither did I disturb the other patrons."
Very Reliable,Always have a good meal and good time at Atout. Allow 1 for 1 wine and myself and 4 male friends made the most of that. Nice toasted gluten free bread available. The various Rillettes are terrific- rabbit very good. Whole shoulder of lamb was terrific. To the point where the recent vegetarian in our group looked like they were regretting the conversion.
French bistro,"Can see why this place is so busy on a Friday night : restaurant was fully booked, service is impeccable, and everything was delicious. The hake fish was one of the most tender I’ve tasted and the hanger steak and linguine were cooked to perfection. They also have a shop on the second floor where you can buy some cakes, ice cream and cheese to enjoy at home!"
Excellent food but service not at par,"We thought we we give it another chance, as the food was great last time we went, compared to before. This time the food was excellent! We had the Belgian endives salad, escargot and the Wagyu beef stew. All really good.
However the service quality is not adequate for a restaurant of this price level. The staff turns the restaurant ambience into a fast food feel as they are not really listening and rushing around. Had to get up 4 times because they always forgot something or switched back on a very strong aircon. They did not even ask if we were happy with the food. Poor staff training & management. And playing funny techno music from random Spotify playlists didn’t really help to improve the ambience. Charging $450 for 2 pax incl wine, this restaurant really needs to work on its service staff quality."
Always great to be back!,"My favourite restaurant in Singapore, amazing food here and very well price. Love their Foie Gras terrine, pig head terrine, pate en croute, braise chicken with garlic and braise Shortrib. Will be back again for sure."
Big shout out to Dave!,"This is a big shout out to Dave (Mr Lee) Finally got to meet you again, after missing you for my/our past couple of visits to Atout.

Thank you for your warmth and gracious smile, the moment we walked down the stairs. It was most comforting that you took care of my guest’s dietary requirements, despite items that were not available.

The duck confit was lovely today, the seafood was fresh, and the heirloom tomatoes... worked a treat! The truffle of mountain goodness (fries) too!

Would love to see you again, shortly. Enjoy your well earned break!

Yes, and hello to Pogi Francis! Salamat Po!"
"Good service, pleasant surroundings","We dined at their Cosy private dining room at level 2. Service was excellent. Flying white ants were buzzing around our table for a while. We enjoyed their signature Amazing Claypot chicken with 40 cloves of garlic. Good fennel salad. Fish was below average. Beef was good but overly peppery. Attentive service was much appreciated.
Their Toilet left a great deal to be desired. The Toilet seat out of alignment, with messy and wet floor. They have a very large car park space."
We will be back,"We returned here to kick off the missus birthday week celebrations. Did not visit last year due to the covid lockdown.

The place was packed, but service was stIll good and friendly. I loved the pork rillete starter, which was the best dish for me. The lobster bisque was full of flavour and rich in taste.

I also liked the seafood pasta, which was delicious, while the wife felt her braised kurobuta pork was just okay.

Dessert was a delightful truffle brie. I am not usually a cheese person, but I thoroughly enjoyed the dish. I had ordered a special chocolate tart slice ($16) for the missus, as well as the dark chocolate pot. The wife preferred the pot though, as she found the tart base rather hard.

Overall, it was a delightful meal, and I thought it was reasonably priced at $132, which included a coffee and a pot of tea."
"Worth visiting with blanket, or enjoy outside","Quite nice food and taste. Friendly staff, and enjoyable interiors. Great.

But the room is over cooled with AC and circulators, and my wife got her grilled beef served not hot when it comes to the table. My grilled pork also got chilled quickly. That's the only disappointment, but a big one, I experienced, since other things are great.

It may be one of Singapore restaurant practices, not to keep foods super warm.. I don't know, we may be too picky for food's temperature..
I wish they could have used a nice thick, well warmed plate for our dishes."
Idyllic al fresco lunch,"Atout has a wonderful setting in lush greenery. It’s 5 min from the main shopping belt in Orchard Road but has a calm relaxed ambience. All the indoor seats were taken so we had to sit outdoors but that worked out fine with a cool breeze in quiet green surroundings.
The set lunch is superb and value for money at $42. Add a glass of wine for $10 and order the beef sirloin for an additional $18. Loved the lobster bisque and Canadian pork belly with polenta.
Service was attentive and very prompt. We finished our 3 course meal and lingered over coffee, all in 1 hour! Highly recommended."
Bad Food. Terrible mussels.,"Bad Food. Terrible mussels.

Came for the steak.

- Steak was meant to be medium well, but got overlooked. Definitely too well done.

Last time, i ordered medium and 1/3 of steak was medium rare.

Maybe it’s the thickness of meat, they just can’t get it right.

Pepper crust is yummy though.

- we only wanted oysters but waitress convinced us how amazing the mussels in white wine sauce was, and it was the last batch. We took the bait.

DO NOT ORDER THE MUSSELS

It was cream sauce, not white wine that I expected. Mussels came “damp” without much sauce. But it was so soggy and mushy, almost felt like it was over cooked.......

Waitress definitely over sold it.

Just to top it all off, we got the wrong bill."
Unacceptable service by Maitre D. Served Main before my guest finished his soup,"Imagine the shock when the main dishes were brought BEFORE my guest could finish his soup. Completely unacceptable. When I pointed this out, I was told by the the European Maitre D that a) I should have told them that I wanted them to delay the service b) They had to get us out as soon as possible in preparation for other guests (although there were empty tables. What a pity as the food is good - confit is delicious, soup and truffle brie. Plonking mains down on guest BEFORE they can finish their APPETIZERS IS UNACCEPTABLE especially in a purportedly French restaurant"
Great Afternoon Out,"Spent the whole afternoon at Atout (again)... since they do not close after lunch service.
Lunch reservations are strongly advised given the crowd and buzz when we arrived.
Set-lunches were great values for their taste, portions and options (with vegetarian option available).

Our sincere appreciation to Mr Dave (Lee) and Mr Loewy for taking care of our table from the moment we arrived, till the dining hall emptied. Their service and interaction were faultless this afternoon. We are certainly looking forward to our next visit!"
Enjoyable dinner,We tried their daily specials - mussels in cream sauce and mont d’or cheese with bacon and onions. Both very good. We also had the grilled octopus and wagyu beef short ribs which was excellent. House wines by the glass were reasonably priced. Many thanks Patrick and team.
Best french food in town,Definitely the best french food we’ve had in Singapore No fuss but excellent choice and quality Service is impeccable too Really enjoyed all our diners there! Highly recommend it to anyone wanting the best french food in Singapore!!
Fantastic lunch!,"For a special experience, this is a wonderful place! Highly recommended - food and the team were excellent. I would happily recommend this restaurant!"
Recommended place for dinner/b’day celebration!,"The staffs were really friendly, and the service was really good. The place was quiet enough for a quality conversation with friends. We had such a complete and satisfying meal and will definitely come back again! Since we are a group of 5, we had a variety of selections from the menu such as melon with parma ham, lobster bisque, french onion soup, Angus beef ribeye “peppered”, French chicken, pork rib, seafood spaghetti.. And toppled off with the hazelnut chocolate cake. Everyone has their own favourite, and we went back with a happy stomach.

Recommended!! Thank you for the good and valued food and services!"
Not Bad,"We managed to get a late booking on Sunday and sat outside where the fans kept us cool. Nice.

We had the set lunch which, apart from the average lobster-less bisque, was wonderful.

The burrata with melon was soft, creamy and refreshing. I had the Barramundi with peas, beans, and a wonderfully tasty sauce and my partner had the seafood Risotto which was equally tasty.

We finished with the truffle brie cheese and chocolate lemon cassis cake, about which there were no complaints.

Good friendly service capped off a good meal. SGD 98 for 2 without drinks was well worth it."
Great place !!,"Always great to be back for their charcuterie, Foie Gras Terrine and pig head terrine are always great. Many great dishes to try too."
Pre-Ordered Butter Delivery on 7th July 2020,"Bad service. Delivery came 3 hours later than the appointed time. No decency to inform the customers that delivery faced delays; numerous calls made to the the restaurant proved redundant, emails also were not replied to.
Finally when I managed to speak to a June who ssid she was the Manager, she requested for our understanding as they have more than a thousand orders for delivery to fulfill.
Whose problem was it?
Never mind, I told myself to understand as it was raining and to show compassion to the delivery guys.

However, the disappointment was huge upon receiving the delivery. The butters were melted, for a dairy perishable, I was stunned the orders were not packed in thermal bags nor did it come with any ice packs. The packaging corners were almost torn, butter oil was leaking thru the paper wrapping. The truffle butter was vacuum packed in a plain plastic envelope without a food label. Is this acceptable??

The quality of the butter most definitely has been compromised. Some pieces were meant as gifts.

What to do now?

If you’re not ready to do LIVE and handle your logistics, please do not even start to do it.

You’ve compromised on your reputation and the quality of your food.

Your response and handling of this matter is totally unacceptable and it frustrates the customers."
Awesome French dinner,"The food is awesome, especially when watching the Chef owner cut and introduce the steak in front of us. The montaor cheese is nice as well. The sausage is just average."
"Black forest cakes,duck Rillettes, Peppered steak- Angus Beef Ribeye all excellent","First of all must try their Black forest Cake. It's Superb! Have ordered many times during lockdown, never once failed. Patrick's duck rillettes and peppered steak are also excellent."
Best traditional and authentic French in town,"A safe and sure value in Dempsey!
Great home made French specialties, terrines, pâtés,merguez etc
The Chef is there almost everyday, keeps an eye on the service, likes to serve and cut the T-bone served, and takes time to chat with the customers.
The meat was absolutely a delight and the selection of wines available will for sure find your satisfaction and help you to cleanse your buds.
If you still have room for some sweets, go for the soufflé. Superb!
A highly recommended address."
Dinner with friends,Food was good and wine selection good too. We opted for second seating which was 8:30pm start (Sat 22 Feb). Service OK. Did not appreciate the fact that after spending almost $1000 at dinenr we were asked to leave the restairant at 10:40 as they wanted to close. Even the head chef (I think owner) was in attendence and just said we need to go they are closing. This was after they did not bring one of the desserts as they did not order it but brought it and the one couple had to swallow it down. Anyway hope business continues to be good for you as surely this wont be tolerated anywhere else in the world.
"Forget the set menu, go à la carte!","Chef Patrick Heuberger is very talented, and that’s why atout is one of the best bistros in Singapore. To really appreciate the good food here, go à la carte. The lunch menu, while reasonably priced, doesn’t include some of their better dishes."
"Lunch at Atout, Harding Road, Singapore","Restaurant was cosy, a tad noisy and service was attentive. It is located in a quiet ""bungalow"" (shared with another outfit) surrounded by lush greenery and ample parking.

Unfortunately, I found the food rather lacking. To be fair, I had ordered the festive 3-course lunch set (costing about S$58 or so excluding beverages/wine). In a business lunch setting I could not bring myself to take photos of the setting nor food.

1st course - Lobster Bisque was tasty and good. I was so looking forward to the rest of the meal.

2nd course - the Duck Confit was a disaster - it was dry and hard (over-done and over-fried). This costs an additional $10, which was to add insult to injury.

3rd course - dessert was Crepes Suzette - passable but blah.

Only still or sparkling water is served - no table water. Don't know if this was meant to add to the exclusiveness of the restaurant.

Overall, I was disappointed with the quality and standards. I had a good look around the table and was greeted with sights of the other dishes which looked tastier (than mine) but serving portions were small. Some commented that their fish was similarly over-cooked and dry. Perhaps the chefs were over-zealous and/or too pre-occupied with other tasks."
A dinner night with friends at Atout,"The ambience was good along with the foods served. The serving staff were attentive and helpful to change our plates when required and also refilled our cups .

As there were two non beef eaters hence we selected the chicken, pork ribs and rabbit stew as main to be shared amongst the four of us along with a few starters. The chicken was good, the pork ribs tendered and the rabbit stew was a little cheesey to be able to taste the mustard."
dinner,had the foie gras and angus ribeye for dinner. food quality is good but service needs to be improved. the staff placed the plates on the table without saying a word??
"Very good experience, as usual...","Nice atmosphere, great Chef and staff, this is a place growing in popularity with the local people and the expat community.
Everything is just very good, most of the products homemade and the wine list recently updated is definitely interesting with a very good choice of French wines for instance (what else with the frog legs?...) and also Australian etc
Excellent sweets, try one of the soufflés they prepare, divine!
Well done guys again!"
Very bad experience,"Terrible restaurant , staff is rude and unreasonable . Food is expensive . Never go again in my life . Go if you want to regret"
The Meat Place,"A casual place that is great for lunch, dinner and even tea. Opens from 1130 to 2200 hrs without a break
Chef Patrick is a master at making his own charcuterie. Love his liver pate and rabbit rillets.

The ribeye steak with peppercorn crust is a must-try . So is the quail stuffed with foie gras. The lamb chops are also great.

Desserts are also awesome if you have space. Profiteroles are to die for.

The set lunches represent tremendous value.

This place doesnt miss a beat. If there is one slight shortcoming if any, it is that it can get quite noisy when the crowd gets boisterous in the evenings.

Wine list is adequate and not expensive. Corkage waiver is on a one for one basis"
A lovely place for lunch,"We had lunch Atout on a Thursday. The restaurant was packed. Service was prompt and attentive. We ordered the Ratatouille, Squid Ink Pasta and French Onion soup. One of my kids ordered a course. All the food was excellent. My kids loved the mash.
A very lovely place to spend a weekday afternoon."
evening with colleagues and wives after a hard days work,The food was fantastic. a total mixture of french and Spanish cuisine. Was probably the best beef I have ever tasted.
For the French Taste!,"A a nice and quiet location (Dempsey area) where used to be the french restaurant Au Petit Salut, now operates, in a more casual set-up, this equally french restaurant Atout. We will return for the excellent taste. Tasty : grenouilles (frog) in entrée, and the lapin à la moutarde."
A French Brasserie in Singapore,"Had an enjoyable evening at this pleasant restaurant in quiet suburban part of the city.The ambience was relaxing,service friendly,and the food,especially the hor d'oeuvres were tasty and in fairly generous portions.We brought our own wine,the '08 Les Clos,which paired very well with the octopus and Foie Gras.The restaurant's wine policy of one for one ,resulted in us having a very enjoyable Pommard,albeit young,from a comprehensive wine list that was provided. This was a good foil for the steak and andoiouilette we had.
A very enjoyable and pleasant evening."
Small French paradise in Dempsey!,"We always go back there for the French delicacies no one else offers in Singapore; andouillettes, frogs legs, merguez, but also excellent beef t-bone!
Service was good, courteous and efficient.
Great selection of wines from France and Australia, but also some good spirits such as Calvados and Armagnac, perfect as digestives after a great meal."
A delightful experience,"We had a wonderful experience dining today and the servers were very friendly as well. Even though we were a little late for the lunch set, the server was kind enough to allow us to order from it still. The food was amazing! Very appealing to the eyes! But my absolute favourite was the dessert! It's really something I've never tried before and I really enjoyed it! The ambience of the restaurant was pleasant as well! Would definitely come back again for more!"
"Good, predictable food","Had lunch for 3 over the weekend. Service was okay but could be improved - the crumbs left from the bread were not swept away from the table until AFTER the dessert, which was disappointing.

Foie Gras Terrine - Just like any FG terrine, it tasted okay with the fig jam. Nothing special about this terrine
Rabbit Rillette - This was great, it wasn't gamey and tasted good. Went well with the toasted bread
40 Garlic Chicken - I tend to love anything with butter so this dish would naturally suit myself. But I can imagine it being overwhelming for my other two companions. The chicken was slightly overcooked as the breasts' texture was rather dry despite being drowned in butter.
Pepper Steak - We requested for a medium-rare steak but got a medium instead. The steak itself tasted good with the pepper not too overwhelming, but the sauce was too salty. Go easy on the salt!
Dark Chocolate Souffle - Good souffle with a rich texture through-and-through. This dish didn't enter the system so the manager was upfront about it to us, apologised, and gave us a complimentary rock melon dessert dish to make-up for the mistake.

Probably won't win the Michelin star as there's no ingenuity or insanely memorable dishes, but it's good enough to warrant a return. Expect your average French fair at this place."
Still a great spot,"Went with family for Saturday lunch, figs was on the menu, so we ordered that as an extra, which was an excellent call. All of us ordered the set lunch, which was actually a little bit heavy for the meal. Lobster bisque was good and my herring salad was quite refreshing. On mains, my barramundi wasn’t a great choice, the Toulouse sausage and duck choices look much better. Desserts were great, soufflé and crepes Suzette hard to go wrong. Love the location and the ease of parking out front. Will be back for a Ala Carte meal one of these days soon."
Figs... seasonal produce,"In SG, fruits are imported. Sometimes they may not be optimal when they arrive. Must admit, the imported figs we ate are just right.... topped with blue cheese and finished with EVOO and a splash of vinegar. SUPERB!!"
Ok,"We ordered pork ribs and the taste was just ok, the sauce doesn't go well with the meat. For the price we were expecting it to come with mashed potato or price or veggie, but nothing. The snapper was actually good but again the sauce tasted the same as the pork rib . Scallop was good, escargot was so-so. Enjoyed the coffee and their desserts, cream brulee and souffle. This restaurant is too expensive for the taste of food. Table was so close to each other."
Consistent performance,"Great selection of French cuisine and a a good wines list.
Frog legs, merguez, chorizo, pig head terrine, beautiful t-bone are among the great dishes you can taste there.
Vegetables and French fries are available too of course...
Good choice of sweets, the soufflé is divine.
Portions are generous so you might want to share.
Mid range pricing and it is worth every penny.
Eager to go back again!"
Good Food but.....,"Was there on 10th August for lunch for the first time. I thought the ambience, food and service was acceptable but what turned me off was when we wanted more butter for our bread and they indicated that there would be a charge for it. For a restaurant which is fairly ""high end"" and not cheap, why would they need to charge for butter ????? Has not that already been factored into the price of the food????Furthermore, I cannot recall any other decent restaurants charging for butter. It is like charging for tap water (which some low-class restaurants do). I thought that ""cheapened"" the restaurant and may not return even though the experience was overall pleasant."
"Good food, great service, lovely ambience","Been here about 8 times, never disappointed, with service or food. Great for couples and also for dinner with friends"
Delicious french cuisine in the heart of Singapore,"This beautiful restaurant has wonderful ambience while being surrounded by lush tropical plants. The options on the menu are absolutely mouthwatering, and it's up to you whether you want to splurge or have a fine french meal.
Their wine list is extensive and don't be afraid to ask the wait staff for recommendations. The staff really are genuine in making your experience the best it can be, and trust me they know which dishes are going to be the best to recommend to you!

I loved the duck foie gras terrine, escargot (a must!), Lobster Bisque
with Scallops Dumpling, any of the beef dishes, and the lamb. And for dessert don't forget the creme brulee or one of their cake specials!

Also check their facebook page for rotating monthly specials where they do a set menu or meals with wine pairings for a good price!

Definitely a date-night or special occasion restaurant. I take my family here whenever I'm back visiting Singapore."
Superb !!!,What to say... Chef PATRICK and his team are just fantastic. Friendly atmosphere and always a pleasure to get back there. Just let you guide by the chef and his recommandation and you will see that you will be astonished. The wine accompanying the food is also of quality and the sommelier Arthur will always guide you accordingly.
Fabulous evening,"Had a fabulous dinner with 8 friends. We were quite lucky to get a table because of a cancellation.

Service was a bit slow as they were packed. However they kept us informed.

A few items were outstanding- the 1 kg beef, which a couple of us shared, the chorizo and the calvados soufflé.

Wonderful evening."
Charming and French,"It’s in a quaint colonial type house along a quiet street with adjoining free open car park space. We had a private dining room that was cosy and elegant.
The meal was quite delicious. The mushroom veloute soup was fresh and flavoursome. Duck and salmon rilletes, foie gras pate were superb with the freshly baked warm bread. Loved the barramundi fillet, roasted chicken and pepper crust ribeye.
Desserts were delightful - The best profiteroles ever! The creme brûlée and black Forrest cake were Super too.
Service was prompt and helpful. The wait staff were knowledgeable, accommodating yet unobtrusive.
For such an excellent fine dining experience, we were pleasantly surprised by how affordable it was!
Highly recommended!"
"punctual, prompt and sensitive service",the ATOUT is a venue to visit; indeed a *must visit*. The offerings are vast and the service impeccable.
Weekday dinner,"We had a simple dinner during a weekday day evening.
Very good discovery : tasty French food , large portion , price is relatively reasonable.
Friendly and efficient service.
Very large choice of wines at competitive price.
A good sign is the restaurant was full on a Monday evening.
If you missed the good French brasserie food is the place to go."
Excellent Casual Dinner,"First and foremost: Exceptional service from Mandy. But also, Delicious food from Chef — the Burrata was super creamy, the Duck Confit cooked to perfection, Oysters fresh and briny, Rabbit flavorful, cold Lentil Salad spot on. Fantastic wine list with a few hard to get producers and extensive Champagne choices. Sadly, no room for dessert, but the ones we saw come out to other tables looked lovely."
A positive surprise!,"I was invited by some friends, the first time in ATOUT.
I must say that lately I am very demanding in relation to food in Singapore, but I must admit that ATOUT impressed me positively. First of all, the place is very nice and well sized: the tables are not too close to each other, there is an area under a pergola for those wishing to dine outside of air-conditioned environments. After a quick read of the menu, I chose the one that in Asia is quite difficult to find in a restaurant: the rabbit. I am a lover of rabbit meat and have therefore launched a personal ""challenge"" to the chef.
Well, after an appetizer of cold cuts, caprese and pate, my plate arrived, served in what should be a small painted terracotta pot, there was my rabbit, immersed in a delicate mustard sauce, scented with twigs of fresh thyme. The scent was exceptional and so was the taste. The cooking was perfect, and the combination with the sauce, gives a boost to the whole.
Well, what can I say ... I will go there again to try other dishes, given the positive first experience!"
Great meal,"Always great to be back for dinner, as usual the foie gras terrine, pig head terrine, burrata with tomato and roast snapper. We were stuffed!! Always great to be back!!"
Modern French restaurant with an interesting menu,"Set in the lush location of Dempsey, Atout offers a wide selection of French style cuisine from an a la carte and set menu. We went in a group and chose from both."
Consistent quality,"Great experience there again to sample (and enjoy) French delicacies.
The meat is tender and tasty, the sausages were very good and the grilled vegetables (spuds and capsicums) were just perfect.
Impressive list of Champagnes and wines from over the world.
but with a preferençe for France. We loved the Pic saint loup, rich and full bodied.
The service was great, but this time we ate inside and unfortunately, as customers start to pack in, it becomes very noisy.
But a great experience !"
Nice an quiet expansiv Dinner,We went to Atout because of a friends recommandation and we had a good dinner. It was not the best we ever had but regarding the price it should has been so. Nevertheless it was a nice Dinner/ Evening we spend there.
Nice environment,"Had lunch set meal for $42+++. I think the environment is nice, quite a lot of Japanese. They have a lot of varieties of alcohol. The food is nice but didn’t leave a deep impression. The lobster soup is nice, the chicken thigh taste more like Breast meat. Staff very friendly but not detail enough to wipe the table with bread crumbs"
Wonderful French country cooking.,Lovely airy and light restaurant in a garden setting near the Botanical Gardens. Excellent and tasty French country cooking from Chef Patrick. Big flavours from a nice varied menu. Reasonably priced wine list.
Love the meats,I was won over by the meats - especially the pork chop and beef. The wines are reasonably priced too. I will definitely visit again.
Birthday dinner,"Super good environment, Celebrated my wife birthday there with 2 babies and they love it. the stuff was playing with the babies and serve us very well. I like it! will be back for more!"
Family with young kids not behaving welcome Friday night?!??,Excellent food and reasonably priced. Good service overall. However when I asked the manager if he could speak to the family behind us with young kids running and screaming around he turned me down in a very rude way. It is a restaurant he said! By the way there was only 1 family with kids in the entire restaurant. As a family father I know how nice it is to have a meal together but the kids were having bad manners and the parents let them do. Kids aged below 6 years should be home at 8pm. We wont return because of the manager’s attitude.
Over Rated,"We are happy with the Mushroom and Onion soup but we were very disappointed with The vegan dish which taste like a Indian dish. As for the duck , it is nothing to shout for. I am giving up on French food in Singapore."
"Great buzz, delicious unpretentious food & decently priced wines!","I dont usually say this after my first visit to any restaurant but with ATOUT, I have to say my experience was excellent. The Seared Hokkaido Scallops ($28) were fresh, & the Lamb Merguez sausage ($28) beautifully seasoned. The angus ribeye pepper steak was worth the $88 pricetag but my favourite of evening was the garlicy frogs legs ($28) and the 40 garlic roast chicken ($36) which incidentally is big enough for 2 pax.

The wine list eclectic and affordable to all (starting at $60 for house pours). However since I was in a good mood, I went for the expensive saint aubin ($138) and vosnee romanee ($230), and I can tell you, each drop was as gorgeous as Adam Levine with a tight tshirt!

The service surprisingly was perfect for me: this means the waiters DID NOT POUR MY WINE, (THANK YOU) and DID NOT TAKE MY DISHES AWAY IN A RUSH, (THANK YOU AGAIN) and the charming occasional company of Arthur the manager and Patrick the chef made the evening even sweeter.

The ambience finally was buzzing with a full room of happy locals, expats, tourists and the occasional transgender.

Overall score = 9/10 and yes I'm coming back!"
"When in Atout, do the chargrilled pork.","The birthday bestie treat seam-filled with French ooh-la-la ❤️ at Atout. The grand highlight was chargrilled Canadian pork chop, pepper crust style. The crunchy slightly spicy exterior gives way to the melt-in-your-mouth fat in the centre. The gorgeous pink of the pork seduces. Duck rillette has excellent consistency and the layers of fat coat your taste buds. The only miss was the odd mix of crowd. It’s semi sandwiched between casual dining and fine dining. But at fine dining prices. Perhaps a segregation of crowds who prefer a quiet fine dining ambience by drawing the separating glass door could do the trick.
#eatstylishtravelstylish"
Set lunch,"Came here for the first time for lunch this week with some friends. We all opted for the 3 course set lunch at $42++. I chose the duck rillette, the snapper and the crepes for dessert. The appetiser was good but somehow the main and the dessert seemed a little bland. No reservation needed for the weekday lunch. Service was friendly and efficient."
Wonderful dining experience,Chef Patrick’s specialties of cold cuts and beef steaks are the best in town!! Casual yet sophiscated dining experience! A fan for sure!
A disappointing evening,"Risotto was like Porridge and Fish was over cooked and lacked flavour. While we were having our main course , they insisted that we must order our desserts immediately as wanted to close . We were out of the restaurant before 10 pm"
Charming and French,"It’s in a quaint colonial type house along a quiet street with adjoining free open car park space. We had a private dining room that was cosy and elegant.
The meal was quite delicious. The mushroom veloute soup was fresh and flavoursome. Duck confit had a perfect crisp skin but the meat was a tad dry.
Service was prompt and helpful."
Authentically Traditional French Food,"Started with chicken liver pate with foie gras and duck rillettes which were delicious on baguette slices. Followed by grilled octopus. For the mains, we had pork sausages with steam mussels in wine, fennel & celery broth, plus red wine braised beef cheeks with carrots & mushrooms and steamed rainbow trout stuffed with scallops and prawn mousse. The desserts were even more amazing - apple souffle, crème brûlée and truffle Brie with dried fruits & fig jam. The entire meal was paired by 6 wines and 1 digestif. All that for S$198 per person!"
Delightful lunch,"Having taken over the location of Au Petit Salut, the premises have lovely gardens and delightful nooks, including private dining areas upstairs.

The service and food lived up to expectations, as well. The duck rillette was rustic, tasty and non oily, while the lobster bisque was good too. The freshly baked bread went especially well with the rillette.

I enjoyed the pork and fennel sausage, though thought it had too much cumin. My wife liked thr braised pork shoulder, which was quite a generous portion as well.

The choco banana tart was not too sweet And the chocolate taste did not overpower the other ingredients. They made a mistake with our other dessert - my wife had ordered the earl grey cake but we got the mango espuma instead - but we did not realise until we had already taken a few spoonfuls. It was okay, though my wife said it was too foamy and did not have substance, while I did enjoy the slight tartness.

Overall, it was a good lunch and a great start to a week long gastronomic birthday treat for her."
Atout - French cuisine at Dempsey,"Great ambience, food and service. My guest loved it and she will bring her family. Thank you for the memorable meal. A little pricey - the only reason for not revisiting too often."
Excellent,"Had another excellent dinner here! Was a last minutes decision, had foie gras terrine and duck rillet, braised beef cheek and soufflé! Never get enough of their foie gras terrine !! Will be back for sure"
Excellent set lunch!,"We went for the lunch set and all of us ordered something different. 4 out of 5 of us very happy. A little disappointed with the sausage. Not quite on par with the rest of our orders (snapper, pork, and beef tenderloin were all delicious) Desserts were also amazing! (Apple tart, mango, crème brûle and brie cheese platter). Service was very attentive but a little too speedy initially (I know, who complains about quick service?) but they slowed down as soon as we told them we were there for a leisurely lunch. Cant wait to go back!"
"Nice Atmosphere, Great food!","My first visit to this french restaurant on a Valentines. Set up of the restaurant make the whole atmosphere looks relax. Strongly recommend the 1kgs Angus Prime Rib! The beef with medium rare ensure the meat so juicy and the shallots covers the beef with its fragrance. Chef Patrick introduce us with the dish in a professional way. The Prime Rib is good to share with 4 pax as it comes with 1kg servings only. Escargot with garlic butter also a must to try! It's yummy. Overall service and experience is great! Will definitely recommend my friend to visit again.
Note* It's better to reserve a table before you go if a group of more than 4."
Great food but can be less salty,Food was really good but ambience even better - sat outside for dessert and coffee although it was in the afternoon. It was cool and shady thanks to the trees and a big fan blowing.Service staff was very attentive. Thank you.
Value for money set lunch,"As usual, the food is delicious. Lobster bisque was full of umami, and scallop appetiser was so yummy and generous. Will be back"
Cuisine Francaise a Dempsey Hill!,"It was my first visit since Chef Patrick had taken over the restaurant from the previous owners, and we were a party of three for Sunday lunch. We had a reservation - which was just as well, as the place was fairly full. The indoors area (one can dine outside under a covered terrace if one wishes) was bright, with lots of natural light on a sunny day, and views over the surrounding greenery and water feature. It certainly wasn't a hushed atmosphere, but the noise levels were consistent with a busy family restaurant at lunchtime, and no impediment to quiet conversation. Our appetisers of pork terrine, pate en croute (both made in-house) and cods liver were all very good, and no less than one would expect of a place that majors on its charcuterie. Our mains were no less satisfying: a peppered ribeye steak, a beef tartare (a dish one chooses only at an establishment in which one has great confidence), and a squid ink pasta with seafood. The waiter explained that the steak was a ""sharing"" size portion, but it wasn't too much for a single diner (not ours anyway!). The French fries were well, very French. We couldn't resist the desserts: two of us enjoyed the prunes in Armagnac (outstanding), and the other a chocolate souffle - which was subsequently pronounced to be well worth the fifteen minutes wait. The service was prompt and pleasant. The only disappointment was the very limited range of wines by the glass: a situation that shouldn't exist in these days of modern wine dispensing devices. Such good food deserves an equally good range of wines by the glass!"
Disappointing despite the good reviews,"We went for brunch. I did have my reservations about the forced sharing of dishes and it was true that it did not work for 4 of us. The sides were served in 1 bowl per couple. I can understand why as the table was too cramped which is another problem. The lobters bisque and chocolate souffle were the only good dishes on the menu. The chicken was too dry thus we could not finish it. The fish was just average. The service was a bit too hurried as we had to tell the wait staff not to remove dishes on 2 occasions. The waffles are average and not memorable. At SGD$80 a person, I could spend my money better elsewhere."
Change is not necessarily good.,"1. Noisy not the place for a quiet meal anymore.2. Ambience unlike before, unwelcoming. Except for the remaining staff from the previous mgt."
Good but needs work,"There are some things that really bother me about restaurants. One is the annoying habit of charging for things that should be free. I ordered the duck rillettes, which is a dish that must be served with bread. No bread was served. But the restaurant then asked me to pay $3 for bread. And $1 for butter! Why? ""We make our own bread and butter."" Now maybe this is a small thing. But when you are paying high prices for fine dining you shouldn't have to pay extra for bread and butter. (they finally made a point of giving me some bread for free). And the main courses come with nothing so you have to pay extra for veggies and potatoes. Food was good, but nothing special. There are much better French casual bistros. We won't be back."
Great service n fantastic food quality,"Value for money. Portions good for sharing. We ordered chicken in forty garlic, duck confit, angus beef 500g n squid appetizer. All extremely tasty. Ambience very nice n service staff friendly. Highly recommended."
The Best of France in Singapore,What can I say - beautiful French provincial cuisine - informal dining- beautiful attention to detail.
Amazing french food,"Atout has become my favorite French restaurant in Singapore. Both the ambience and food are amazing! We ordered from both the set lunch and alacarte menus.

My favorite appetisers were the frog legs and the Turkey and bacon rilletes. The frog legs were fried, so a bit crispy on the outside but juicy and tender on the inside with a light onion based dressing. Atout uses fresh frogs so you can taste the sweetness of the flesh.

The red wine braised venison and and French quail stuffed with mushrooms and foie gras was also very good."
Great rillettes & a happy table!,"I visited years ago when the restaurant was Au Petit Salut and I can confirm that things have only got better. Less formal and perhaps more focus on the food, we were 10 people for lunch and I think that everyone enjoyed Atout.

We all opted for the set lunch menu but kicked things off with the duck and rabbit rillettes as well as some tongue and a cheese board. The rillettes were very good and worth the trip alone, we definitely started on a high!

There are other french restaurants in Singapore that I like more than Atout but it is certainly up there and I will look forward to exploring the menu further next time!!"
Excellent,"One of the best rabbit stews I have ever had. I’ve been here a number of other times, and the food is overall quite amazing, but the rabbit exceeded expectations."
Amazing !,Atout offer an outstanding and high quality french food. I felt in a Bouchon Lyonnais. The service is very good and everyone are helpful and welcoming. I'll go back as soon as possible !
Beautiful French fare,"Atout wasn't trying too hard. It was just good food, great taste and wonderful service. We ordered the salad composte, lobster bisque and ham platter for starters. They were fresh, clean and very flavourful. Bread was yum. And you can't go wrong with french butter.

Main were the seabass and forty garlic chicken. Both were great but special mention to the seabass: cooked to perfection and absolutely unpretentious. Big portions, good for sharing too.

We skipped desserts, which was a shame! Will be back for the desserts next. Truly one of our faves from now on."
Delicious yet unpretentious food,"Everything we ordered was super delicious; From the truffle brie, tomato salad, foie gras, chargrilled octopus, pepper crusted steak and pear tart. Chef Patrick has revived the old Au Petit Salut, it is now one of the best French restaurant in SG."
