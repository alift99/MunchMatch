Good as always,A long queue now. 30 minutes as tourists arrive. . Go now before more arrive. Service fast. Like it. Food as you like it‚Ä¶.. fast. Good luck
Terrible Service! Do not go,"Terrible service at the Chinatown Point outlet - I was handed a QR code with no further instructions. When I approached the one of the older waiters for help, he dismissed me saying I had to line up. I told him I was already seated and hence did not need to join the queue and I only wanted to get some help with making the order using the code. I tried asking again, and he dismissed me again saying that I just had to line up for a seat.. He did not even take an interest in what I was asking for - not just once, but repeatedly. I left without having a meal as I could not get help making an order. It wasn't just that one staff that was rude, the rest also displayed a very dismissive attitude.

I went to another restaurant - Tongue Tip Langzhou Beef Noodles at the basement level - much better service, and the beef noodles (handmade) was very nice!"
Pork rib soup,"This chain from south bridge road expanded around singapore and beyond in recent years. Quality depends on the branch Besides pork rib soup, they have noodles and in some countries, even hot pot"
Nice Bak Kut Teh experience but better service needed,"We went to the Song Fa Bak Ku Teh restaurant in Singapore in Chinatown district. The restaurant was very crowded on a Monday lunch period. We ordered the lunch set which included Bak Ku Teh and a bowl of rice, and also refillable soup, which was really appreciated as one bowl of soup would be too little. The Bak Ku Teh was very tasty, there was some pork and it was filling. The service could have been improved as they were catering to too many customers on a weekday lunch period. Same as the ambience- the restaurant was rather small hence not a lot of space between each tables. The lunch cost was reasonable."
Homey feel,The usual great fare without the massive queues at the mothership branch. And air on that you can feel. Topped up on the soup only twice. Don‚Äôt want to over do it.
Very popular at lunch,"A friend and I had lunch here several weeks ago when our respective schedules found a common slot. It was just past the start of the usual lunch hour, but the place was already nearly full. We plonked for the second-last available table, and proceeded to order using their tablet menu. It took a fair wait for our orders to arrive, presumably because of the newly-arrived crowd. But it was worth wait for nicely-flavoured pork rib soup along with rice and traditional (essential) side dishes (incl. fried dough fritters and salted vegetables). Prices were a little high but that seems to be the norm these days as pork rib soup becomes more common in restaurants than hawker stalls these days."
Pork rib soup and more,"My go to place for pork rib soup or simple meal. Pair the pork rib soup with fried fritters and salted vegetables, and you have a classic meal from the 70s. The unlimited soup refill is great"
Super bad service,"Very bad service attitude during dine-in. Moreover, takeaways must be placed in person and cannot be placed via phone which is ridiculous. Food is so-so only, and more like a tourist attraction for SG Bak Kut Teh, while there are many much better alternatives. Strongly DO NOT recommend, better to go for other Bak Kut Teh brands."
Finally the soup tastes better when just open after CB,"The photo at left was taken when the restaurant opened at phase 2 first day. The ribs hard to bite and the soup also not nice. I think maybe because of the chef didn't cook for a while... And I'm totally understood. Photo at the right was taken at around 10 days ago, and finally every dish we order the tast back to Song Fa standard. Will continue to love the place and of course I hope when you read the review please trust their quality of food."
No Frills Bak Kut Teh Lunch Spot,"Song Fa had been a regular no frills Bak Kut Teh lunch for my friends and I for quite awhile. Usually spots a long lunch queue at most of its locations, nowadays without the tourists quite manageable. If I am introducing Bak Kut Teh to tourist friends, Song Fa will not be my choice. But for a simple lunch in a mall between friends, reasonable prices, reasonable food and brisk customer service make Song Fa a great go to place. Menu is simple and systematic, plenty of sides choices, no frill lunch sets and promotions. Basically the peppery TeoChew style soup is tasty and flavourful but not as peppery as the traditional brands. Dragon bones not as tender or flavourful as I would like but at least not as stiff as the regular Bak Kut. Taupok, Big intestines and Lor Bak heavy on anistar but nicely cleaned and tender. Youtiao is crispy, chai buay tasty and the kungfu tea is s nice traditional touch. Don't know why Char Siew is being introduced. Maybe to appeal to tourists or the younger generation. Nice char and tender bite but bascially only taste of glaze and marinate. Best cut for Char Siew is not belly meat. Overall 3 to 4 stars no frill food for lunch with some tea to chat over and brisk, efficient services. Michelin recommended but not the best Bak Kut Teh I had for sure"
Dry vegetables,"We were a family of 5 visiting. The meat was ok but not Michelin bin gourmand worthy. We had also had two sides of vegetables (pea sprouts and Cai Xin) without oyster sauce due to allergies. The vegetables were dry and overcooked and the sprouts were sticking to one another.
All in all disappointing."
One of my preferered Bak Kut Teh in SG!,"Tried a lot of chain Bak Kut Teh places in Singapore and Song Fa is really one of my most favorite stalls :)

Really like how consistent are their peppery soup, and the staffs are really nice to offer unlimited refills, so you can be assured that you are able to enjoy the soup to your fill!

Some of my personal favorites to recommend people:

1) Sliced Pork Soup- very tender and chewy, good for people who are lazy to chew on the bone

2) Mee sua- I prefer this over rice as it is very smooth and goes perfectly well with the sliced pork

3) Pork trotter, big and small intestine- these parts of the pork are really well marinated and you could really taste the sauce along with the tenderness of the meat! So these are some good combinations that I will order as well

4) Fried You tiao- I will always order this to soak on the peppery soup and the crunchiness of the you tiao goes really well with the soup

Lastly, Some other side dishes that I will order also included salted vegetables, Dried beancurd skin.

Overall, it's a place that I will drop by over and over again!"
Delicious Bak Kut Teh and attentive staff,"We do enjoy the authentic cuisine in Singapore, Song Fa Bak Kut Teh. It is very tasty and nutritious. The staff is very friendly and attentive to serve the soup (free of charge) till we are satisfied. It is highly recommended. This is real value added meal!"
Best,"Even we took a heavy breakfast, wanted to take a chance on this award winning brand. Not only cannot regret... probably is one of the best places ever. My mouth is watering at this moment just for writing the review."
Delicious,"Fall-off-the-bone tender pork rib meat and delicious soup, although a bit heavy on the pepper. Highly recommend!!!"
song fa BKT Chinatown,the meat so tender..the portiin is big enough to fill to grown up stomach..we ordered one bak kut teh and two rice with one tofu..it is for 15.75 included tax and GST..top notch
Best BKT,"Excellent, peppery Bak Kut Teh with great dough and free soup refills. An inexpensive and tasty meal."
"Tasty bak kut teh/ pork rib soup, worthwhile a try","Went to the outlet in Upper Circular Road, Clarke Quay. It is a busy place with many tables inside and outside. It is a quick service meal , the pork rib is well done and the soup refill is free. The garlic head inside the soup also melts in the mouth. We had a portion of rice, and vegetables. It is enough if you are not a young big eater.SGD16 with a drink."
Piping hot soup,Like to do lunch at song fa whenever I feel like having some hot soup. Their rice üçö is always so nice and fragrance. Salted vegetables is always a great addition and blend in well with the pock rib soup. Love their refill soup.
Top notch Bak Kut Teh ever,I have tried Bak Kut Teh before but this is the best ever. Good services and very fast event there were a lot of customers. It is Singapore Michelin Guide. Extremely recommends!!!
Delicious ribs soup,"So expect to be in que for 15-20 minutes since it's so popular amoung tourists.
But they let you order even when you are on que, so the food is served hot and quick.
The main thing here is soup, nevertheless you can order rice or noodle including side dish like fried vegetable, fried meat.
You can even purchase tea and spice soup to enjoy at your home."
Never know it could taste so good,"I never had a good experience eating Bak Kut Teh before but Song FA's definitely changes that opinion.

We tried the one at Clark Quay and it's totally worth the 10-15 mins. Staffs are friendly and efficient. You can't make a reservation so you basically just need to wait in line.

The waitress will get your order while you wait so your order are served within 5 mins of you sitting down.

Other ""side"" dishes are good too. Oh and have I mentioned they kept topping up the soup! You seriously can't go wrong with this."
Love it!!,"Awesome food, fast service, friendly staff and fluently English. Great location near by Chainatown MRT. Great will be back."
A fsvorite!,"Wonderful pork ribs especially with fritters and rice. There is always a long queue, so be prepared to wait, because it is worth it,"
The Classic Soup,you cannot imagine from what you see from the clear soup. The taste is so brilliant. and there are many branches in this town.
Vietnamese tourists say ¬´X√¥ng Pha!‚Äù when they go to Song Fa,"Why do people stand in line for, sometimes 30‚Äô, to eat here, when Legendary Bak Kut Teh just a block away, is empty? The ribs and pork intestines are indeed very good, but the main reason is some clever deal with travel agents, that send tourists here by the bus loads."
Still the best,Still the best Bak Kut Teh in Singapore. Especially prefer the soft pork meat and the eay they prepare their Bak Kut Teh. Price is also reasonable compared to other Bak Kut Teh shop.
Delicious Pork Rib Soup,A must try herbal soup (non-halal). A Super rich aroma of spices & herbs to awaken your taste buds. An unforgettable food experience like never before.
Excellent food,"We had the pork rib soup. What a great choice. The food was excellent and the waiter kept filling up the soup at no extra cost. We got there at 11.30 for lunch, by the time we left there was a massive line waiting to get on. You have to eat here."
Best place to go to when you‚Äôre sick.,I love bak kuh teh! It‚Äôs super good especially when you‚Äôre about to get a flu because it will literally make you feel better! The soup is freeflow which makes it more awesome!
Yummy,Visited the branch at Yishun Northpoint. Very good service. The staffs welcomed and took our orders with smiles. Also made sure we have refills of soup. The soup was excellent. Pork bone were tender although not the most tender I had eaten before. We can tell Songfa takes pride in their food by serving us crispy yu cha kweh. We had a lovely dinner. Will return again!
Amazing bak kut teh,"Nice atmosphere, lovely waiters and amazing food. Will definitely visit again. Really glad they have multiple chains across Singapore."
Excellent bak kut teh and service staff,"This was a surprising find. Despite the queue, we decided to give it a try since it will be our first visit to Song Fa. Service staff moved the queue really fast. Took orders for those waiting in line. Very efficient. And when we were shown our seats, the food came just a while later. Like clockwork. The bak kut teh turned out to be so good. One of the best we have ever tasted in Singapore."
dinner,this restaurant has a long queue. they have a few outlets. service is sometimes slow. food is decent.
Mind-blowing Bak Kut Teh in Singapore,"I could not remember if I've had bak kut tehs before. I may have but they were probably toned down version of the authentic one.

But wow, this one was amazing. I love that it's a bit spicy. Ordered a drink I liked too, but I could no longer remember the name (it was white).

Like many famous restaurants in sg, be prepared to be on queue, even on non-peak hours."
Edible and crowded,"Busy and long queues at lunchtime. Good service, rustic decor, we sat outside where there was more space. The ordinary Bak Kut Teh was peppery , slightly salty, and at 11 am, the meat was not soft enough. Free flow of additional soup topups. We also tried the fried water cress vegetable, liver and kidney and intestines side dishes. The fried croutons were a tad bit salty."
First evening in town,"On our first evening in town our driver recommended us this place. Super simple and super food. Simple plastic chairs and tables but fast service and really good authentic food. Not many Europeans around, which is a good thing!"
enjoyed,"the soup was tasty, the ribs very good, the bok joy fresh, the ngoh hiang delicious. we didn't have much of a wait on a Saturday night, maybe 10 minutes. service was efficient. you come here for the food; not atmosphere; and we would definitely come back."
Superb food,"I was there for lunch with my families. The Bak Kut was very chewy and tasty, you can add the soup for free as many as you want.
The queue was a little bit long but still ok, especially lunch time.
They have 2 store in chinatown area, 1 is beside Mc. Donald, in front of the mall, and the other one inside the mall.
Once you try surely want to go there again."
Repeat,Came here two years ago and this time bringing other family members to this establishment after we debarked from our cruise. I do prefer this peppery flavor pork ribs soup instead of the herbal kind. We had to get in the short line this time but were seated inside after waiting a while. We were given paper fans to get us through the hot weather. The soup we ordered were good as usual with unlimited refills of soup.
Be there early to avoid the queue!,"Bak kut teh is one of the national dishes of Singapore, everybody claims theirs is the best, but man oh man, this one leaves others in the dust! Mind you this is not a 3 hat restaurant, the dishes don't look flashy, the plates/bowls look so home-style, but the tastes speak for themselves!"
Nothing special,"I visited here, expecting heart warming food as people said. Bak ku teh is rather normal, not bad not good. Pork ribs taste honest porky flavour, broth is light. No airconditioning in/outside of the restaurant, not quite nice environment for warm broth."
All about pork,"The pork ribs soup is the most famous in this restaurant, for me the soup is spicy, too much pepper. But the ribs are yummy üëçüëç"
First Bak Kut Teh of our lives,"A really good first time experience. Didn‚Äôt know what to expect and didn‚Äôt have any expectations. The line wasn‚Äôt too long at 8:30pm and we only waited for 10 minutes and they took our order while waiting. Once our table was ready, the food was served only moments later and judging by the looks of it, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. But upon tasting it, it was exactly what I was looking for - hot and peppery. I got full on the soup alone before even starting on the pork ribs. The servers were amazingly attentive, they poured soup liberally and they seem to notice every time I raised my hand to order something new.

Prices were ok for a very satisfying meal (I attached a photo).

Very pleasant experience and definitely something I would recommend."
Iconic dish,"Pork rib soup is one of the must try when you come to Singapore.
Found this reputable place while we were at Chinatown. Waited about 10 mins to be seated. The restaurant isn‚Äôt so big but very busy. Orders came out very quickly. Dishes look clean and good quality. Vegetable side dishes were tasty too.
This wasn‚Äôt my first time having Bak Kut Teh. From my memory it wasn‚Äôt very peppery. The soup at Song Fa is very strong with white pepper taste. So now I don‚Äôt know what the authentic taste should be.
Happy to recommend this place if you are nearby."
pass or only if no time and low budget to spend,"Chinese kind of fast food.. food is average, service is average. but prices are low and it is clean. For a first time I regretted not to have gone to the McDonald next door! sad."
Dissapointed because I was expecting better.,"I saw on internet that this restaurant was an institution in Singapour, so I was super excited
to taste local food from Singapour but i was extremly dissapointed‚Ä¶:(
I found the food was bland and not really tasty maybe because I'm not used to eat that kind of food (?) but nothing special..."
Favorite pork rib soup!,"My favourite Bak Kut Teh in Singapore.
Songfa in Chinatown always has long queue so go early to avoid disappointment or long wait (it doesn‚Äôt take reservation).
I must say all the dishes are good but here are some of my favourites that are MUST ORDER.

Prime rib soup - hot and peppery
Kidney soup - the kidney is the best and doesn‚Äôt have the smelly taste
Braised Big intestine - must order
Tang-O(vegetable) soup - acquired taste but I love it
Braised Pig trotter - tender and yummy (not for those who hates the fats though)
Youtiao (fried dough) - crispy and goes well with the soup

Their service is always good and prompt too. Unlimited refill of hot soup as long as you can finish!
Highly recommended!"
2nd visit this year and equally good!!,Tried the dry fried ribs at the New Bridge Rd / Chinatown branch. Liked it more than the traditional clear broth ribs. Queue was a tad long during lunch time.
There is just that satisfaction in the soup!,"The restaurant was more than half full when we arrived at 11am. We ordered the soup with the ribs straightaway, and topped up with another bowl of intestines. They came within minutes and the meats went straight down the guts. How satisfying! These ribs just became more tasty after generously dipped in the dark soy sauce. Hot peppery soup kept being filled by the attendants. Great tasty meal for a great lunch."
Tasty Bak Kut Teh,Visited here with friends. The signature Bak Kut Teh pork ribs were very meaty and delicious. Pity there was only 3 ribs for the regular $8 serving. The soup itself was more the peppery (as opposed to herbal) variety of Bak Kut Teh. Free refills of soup was a bonus.
"Cheap, tasty and helpful","Bak kut teh and Chinese tea is good,especially a store clerk kindly taught us how to drink when we did not know ."
Great Bak Kut Teh!!,"Remember having bak kut teh when younger and havent had authentic in a long time. So when saw this famous restaurant for Bak Kuh Teh had to drop in. Place was packed even though restaurant around them were empty. Was only 5PM..totally know why. Very small menu, mainly bak kut teh and they do it perfectly .. Ribs were off the bone tender and the broth was delish... They kept coming around refilling the broth.. Total of 5 times.. The side of Chinese broccoli and
Pork thigh was also very very good. Totally worth it, coming back again tomorrow before we leave."
Good food,Long queue but Fast serving during lunch and dinner hour. Best time is in between the peak meal time. Menu will be provided while queueing. Gives you ample Time to choose your food. Convenient. Chinatown Mrt.
Time honored brand with 50 years history,"One of the best local flavors tourists must try.

Song Fa is a time honored brand. It has almost 50 years history. This Chinatown outlet is the original one.

Among all the delivery food, Song Fa has the best packaging so far. Unlike other Bak Kut teh packaging the soup spilled everywhere when diners received. They use high quality dishware and pack neatly with a gentle reminder sticker on top of each bowl. The detail will show how serious that they focus on their business.

It‚Äôs not easy to cook pork rib tenderly. The ribs are meaty and the peppery soup is just seasoned well. Braised tofu will enhance the salty flavor. This is a great meal choice for sole traveler. You don‚Äôt need to worry of missing any flavor cos Bak Kut teh is the Essence.

The waiting time may be Long so better avoid peak hour. The performance to price ratio is high. No wonder people say at Song Fa, the heritage of Bak kut teh lives on in its truest sense."
Rude & Arrogant Service,"My extended family loves Song Fa and my mum in law took the trouble to pack for 3 families at the Centerpoint branch yesterday.

She asked for an extra packet of soup per family as the grandkids love to eat it with rice. She was turned down flatly with no explanation.

She then tried to ask for 2 packets of soup as if one dines there, the servers would come around repeatedly to top up the soup without being asked.

She was turned down again and the cashier who took her order challenged her: if you are not happy, you can go and complain on Facebook to my boss!

This is not only rude service but also strange behavior as soup comes bottomless when one dines there.

And the place was not even busy! Not matter how delicious, they will not survive for long when there isn‚Äôt any basic courtesy.

Never going back."
Love it !!,One of my favourite restaurant in Singapore. Super delicious bak kut teh with premium pork ribs. Very recommended !!
Excellent services - Very thoughtful,"My mother and myself went to this place for brunch this morning. I am totally impressed with their services. The waitress noticed that my mother is quite weak and volunteer to change her seat to those with back support without me having to ask. By the way, the standard chairs they use will be those stool looking type. She is very comfortable with her back-support chair. I appreciate her initiative.
While we are having the meal, another waiter notice that my mother put her handbag beside her and give her a piece of cloth to cover her handbag. At first, we did not realize what is the cloth for. I was told that this cloth will deter pickpockets since the entire handbag is covered and will not be easy to pick things out from. This company not only go for good food and service but will go extra mile to protect their patron which impressed me. It is not all about dollars and cents but they run their business with a heart."
Love the soup!,"Bak Kut Teh here is very delicious especially the taste of the soup. It's the kind of food that makes you feel good. Despite a very long waiting line, they manage pretty well. During peak hours, you might need to wait 20-30 minutes but once you get your table, the food is served right away."
Nice food,Long queue at this place during meal times. Best to go at odd hours. Food is great. Reasonably priced.
Pork rib soup,1 of the places to have good pork rib soup in singapore. And the branches here and elsewhere are always crowded. I arrived at 9pm and there‚Äôs still a line. Good food and not too expensive. The nice part is they give u unlimited servings of soup
Great Place for Bak Kut Teh,"I usually go to the outlet at UE BizHub with my family but this was near my office, so my colleagues chose this outlet. Song Fa is amongst the best Bak Kut Teh around.

Bak Kut Teh literally means ‚ÄúPork Ribs Tea‚Äù. The main dish is pork ribs in peppery soup. Other dishes include braised pork leg, striploin and parts like liver, big & small intestines, peanuts, tofu and vegetables. Traditionally people drink chinese tea with it.

There are two other outlets nearby at 11 & 17 New Bridge Road but those are crowded and messy. This outlet is clean, spacious and air-conditioned. In addition, the outlet at no. 17 used to collect payment upfront before food is served, which irritates me. Not sure if they still practise this.

If you are not the sort into pig spare parts, you can try safe dishes such as pork rib soup, pig trotters, peanuts, vegetables and big intestines. If you are game, try drinking traditional chinese tea. One packet make into one pot for all to share. Ask the waitress how to make the tea. Don‚Äôt be like my colleague who orders Coke to go with Bak Kut Teh. It‚Äôs like ordering traditional chinese tea with your western steak. You get it.

During lunch & dinner hours, the queue may be long. But it moves fast. So no worries.

Be sure to try this. You will not regret."
"Organisation, service and authentic food","Recommended by a friend we were at first put off by the long line at 6pm outside Song Fa. But they have a great system -- first we were handed a menu, then our order taken, then given a number and seated in a just a few minutes, and our food arrived instantly, and we paid when it was delivered. We had slow cooked pork ribs in a soup, fish soup and a plate of steamed broccoli with two refreshing lemon/lime cool drinks ($S29) Great food for us as we have to stay away from chilli and too many spices. Other customers were very helpful to tell us they would ""top up"" our soup if we liked. At that time we seemed to be the only westerners seated at Song Fa, and we were happy to have the opportunity for such an authentic and tasty food -- also at reasonable prices."
Famous restaurant for tourists,Always crowded when we passed by. But it didnt take long to get a table to try one of the most popular food in Singapore. Bah Ku Teh is very good especially the soup. We also tried another new dish on the menu but didnt remember the name. Price is acceptable for a famous restaurant.
When in China Town Song Fa Bak Kut Teh it.,This is a fantastic place to eat when in China Town. Try the Spicy Pork soup yummy..It does get busy from early evening so get in early for an early tea. It not overpriced and it has a get variety of dishes to suit everyone's tastes.
Excellent Food,"Song Fa is five minutes walk from my hotel and I went there for breakfast, lunch and dinner as the Bak Kut Teh is so delicious. It‚Äôs the restaurant I go everyime I am in Singapore."
Yummy!,Easy to understand menu for a first time visitor and the staff at the entrance helpful with recommendations. Excellent pork ribs and easy on the purse too!
Want to come back again...,Love the taste of classic singaporean bak kut teh. Always want to come back every time we visit Singapore. The queuing is worth to wait.
A lively tourist trap on the edge of Chinatown,"There is incessant queue of tourists outside this store like queue outside LV boutique in Ginza. The business seems booming but the quality of the product gives this signature Singaporean dish a bad name. The broth was overpowered with pepper and MSG. So if u r a tourist and interested in Bak Kit Teh, avoid this trap at any cost."
A classic bak kut teh,"A classic Singaporean at Clarke Quay, serving tasty food, chicken intestines, pork ribs and the like. Definitely not very suitable for vegan people!"
It pays to listen to the concierge!,"My colleague is a big fan of Singapore's Bak Kut Teh so we asked our concierge for a recommendation. He said that Song Fa is the ""only place"" for it. So we heeded his advice and walked around 10 minutes from our hotel. We arrived just in time as the queue was beginning to build. Be prepared to share a table. It was so good that my colleague returned two more times during our quick business trip."
It was a wonderful experience. Order their pot of tea as well!,The soup was bit salty but was really great with a bowl of white rice. Their Oolong tea came with the real tea serving tray. Was really fun to enjoy pork soup with clean Ooolong!
Tasty traditional food,It has many restaurants serving Bak Kut but I & my family tried this special food in this one on family trip three months ago. The soup is delicious and the chopped pork is soft. I ate with rice with another stirred-fried vegetable dish.
The Best And Yummy local food,"""Song Fa Bak Kut Teh Chinatown Point the yummiest and popular in Singapore"" must try Bak Kut very soft and the soup very delicious."
Best singapore signature local food,"This is one of the best local food restaurants in Singapore.
You can see long queue there, but you don't need to wait a long time.
They are quite popular and provide excellent food and service.
There is spicy soup and tender pork.
I would like to visit here again.
Must try first!

Pork ribs in Chinese herbal soup - and tea!,"Brought my son, a true meat eating teenager and he was well satisfied! Kids who are used to Tony Roma's or Westerm grilled ribs will not be disappointed.

I introduced him to our local ribs - Bak Kut Teh. We had the ribs in sweet black sauce and a plate of stewed pork belly and Chai Sim leafy veges in oyster sauce. He wasn't used to the broth with pepper and Chinese spices (not hot) and he took to it!

Also introduced him to fried dough sticks - Yew Tiao and it was crispy and fresh.

We went at an odd time, 5pm so there wasn't a queue.

Friendly staff and decent prices. Keep up the service."
Comfy nutritious soup,"While I have had several occasion to enjoy Back Kut Teh in both Malaysia and Singapore, Song Fa offered a good balanced soup (mild and a good kick of pepper, not too spicy). Friends of us (local Singaporean) took us there for supper and ordered the dishes for us - the singnature pork rib, fried dough, rice and boiled peanuts. Although it was already past 8pm, we waited about 15-20min to have our seats, which also proved their food was popular. The rib was tender and soup tasted really good. We can ask for refill (soup) as much as we want, and price was so reasonable. I would say 10-15SGD would do per person. They have quite a few dishes to select from, and I‚Äôm sure this will be one of my must go place in Singapore."
Definitely the best,My wife and I never missed to drop by one of their stores to eat their pork rib soup. We always take home their instant spices pack.
Soup,"I think this soup good for rainny day . Staff serving active,the price responsible The Q long at 12.00."
Yummy,"Bak Kut Teh, the local food in Singapore. Went to Song Fa that most forum recommend and which is totally true. The bak kut teh is really good and other food are delicious."
Yummy.,I ordered the most famous dish. Bak ku teh was definitely delicious. there many several branch around singapore.
Possibly the best Bak Kut Teh in Singapore,"I have always loved Song Fa Bak Kut The for years, but last night was the first time eating the one at Chinatown Point. I loved that it was indoor and cool with the air-conditioning, which makes it family and all-weather friendly. When we were there on a public holiday night it was about a 15 minute wait, with estimated wait times clearly displayed on the signboard so you knew what to expect. Inside was busy and crowded, yet it did not feel squeezed at all between tables. What I love is that all the staff were patient and friendly, despite our complex and big orders; there were also very efficient in helping us takeaway our leftovers. Do not be shy to ask for soup refills, although most servers are very on the ball about refilling them for you. Enjoy!"
My favorite food in Singapore,we found this restaurant by chance and we absolutely love it and even had 3 meals there which was a lot cause we had just only few days in Singapore. Don't miss it !
You shall not miss this if you are in Singapore,Been waiting for this meal for a very long time since I left Singapore a couple of years ago - definitely should not miss this if you are in Singapore - fantastic taste and great service
Best BKT in Singapore,"Take note that the soup is pepperish. If you are a herbal BKT fan, this is not the place for you. I love pepperish BKT and this place is so good! Order the pig leg and big intestines!! Ask for some garlic and chili padi!!! Pour in the thick dark soya sauce!!! Make a pot of Xiang pian tea!! Best meal after a Long week!!! Breakfast lunch or dinner, all no issue!!!"
Specific meal,"Very specific food for Europeans. There is a menu only with pork meat. The service is very fast. However, no one doesn‚Äôt speak English normally. The meal was normal, but it‚Äôs very heavy for the health. Soup,pork meat and rice are the local Singaporean dish. For me it‚Äôs interesting to taste it once."
Good famous restaurant,"We had a meal there and it was quite good, Bak Kut Teh was good but what we like is the big intestine and braised pork belly, super delicious."
Delicious,"Really, the soup is great. We even bought the soup powder back home. The pork rib was so soft. Really recommend."
A must try,"This is definitively not my type of food but when in Rome you need to do like the Romans so I tried the chicken feet and the pork stomach soup, humm tasty I have to say but I could not eat it all. However, my partner loved it. The tea they serve is intended to help digest all that fat, and they have this beautiful ceremony serving it. Once you see it you can then do it yourself. Judging by the queues every day lunch and dinner, this is a must in Singapore."
A Singapore must,Whenever I come to Singapore Bak Kut Teh here is a must get there before 10.30 and you avoid a long que wonderfull rib soup and a nice old time feel to it.
Good food,Good food. Long queues. Small space. Around 20 SGD per person. Worth a try. Free flow soup servings. Extra 10 cents for additional wet tissue.
The best Bak Kut Teh in Singapore....if you like that sort of thing,"I was taken here by colleagues in Singapore for a business lunch. This is a common Singaporean dish and they were interested in me trying it. I have to say it was edible, but quite an acquired taste. I went for the more expensive loin chop which I would recommend. The meal was accompanied by rice, Pork Belly and Pak Choi which was very nice and more in keeping with what I would eat. Worth a visit for the experience if you're a western business traveler like me."
Glad to try,"The main dish is the bowl of soup. The amount of flavour in the bowl is out of this world, some say its therapeutic some say its hot and junky.

Meat was good in the soup, served with rice and a few interesting side dishes.

Only down side are relatively expensive compared to other local restaurants."
May Not The Best but Must Try,I am here again for Song Fa Bak Kut Teh. I strongly recommended Song Fa Bak Kut Teh if you are looking for Bak Kut Teh as dinner or lunch in Singapore.
Perfect Meal for Chinese Stomach.,"It's one of the most popular restaurants among the Chinese tourists. We arrived at the restaurant at 2PM, it was still full of customers.
The most famous dish, Bak Kut Teh, namely pork ribs soup, is delicious, while the ribs are tender and succulent. Other food are also tasty.
A perfect meal for a Chinese stomach."
Don't miss this Bak Kut Teh in Singapore,"I never try Bak Kut Teh before but i got a suggest from my friend so I go and i have to say that i can have this everyday! spend only 4-5 days at Singapore but I go have lunch here for 2 days.

When you order Bak Kut Teh Soup here you can re-fill it all the time with no limit this so awesome! and they also have sweet veggie, rice, iced tea that you should try too.

so many people when lunch time have to wait in a long line but service pretty fast so don't worry about time.

I got lucky that i met some Singapore guy who once travel to Thailand before and also being a Teacher so he recommend me and my friends so many tip at this restaurant and how to travel in Singapore. that why i'm impressive with food, people and this country."
The Best Bak Kut Teh in Singapore,In my opinion this restaurant served the best bak kut teh in town. The soup is rich in taste (peppery) and the fish dish is also delicious. The price is fair. But this place is always packed with people during lunch and dinner. But it will worth the queue.
"Good taste, must try","I'm from Thailand. We have Bak Kut Teh in Thailand but the taste is quite different. To me, I like Bak Kut Teh at Song Fa because the spicy from pepper and the sweetness of pork rib. Overall taste is delicious and outstanding. This one I put in the category of MUST try."
The best of bak kut teh,"Worth the wait .... Almost everyday during lunch or dinner there will be long Queue . The pork ribs is juicy , succulent and tender. The side dishes look delicious too. The soup is free flow.... Service was normal..."
A tasty peppery Bah Kut Teh served up quick smart,"If you haven't discovered the delights of pork bones boiled in a fantastic peppery broth.. you need to try Song Fa... you won't be alone!.. there will be people queueing inside and outside ( tip .. go inside the mall and queue there, the line will be shorter.

I had the large pork bone stew and shared a large bowl of the Chinese donuts to soak up the broth.. and servers with large kettles will top up your bowl when needed!
I have had Malaysian Bak Kut Teh (BKT) which is a slightly more herbal infusion than that of more spicy and peppery Singaporean edition.. Both are great though Songa Fa serves the peppery version which was apparently originally enjoyed buy Chinese labourers, originating maybe from Fujian, China. There is not a huge menu for fussy eaters so park them a McDonalds next door or give them some white rice and greens to enjoy"
