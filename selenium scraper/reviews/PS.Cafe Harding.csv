Great food! Great service!,"The service was on point. Helpful, attentive and friendly. The food came out quickly and was tasty. My only criticism is that the restaurant was cold. Which made it a little uncomfortable."
Terrible Service but YUM,"I had a reservation for myself and my mother; we arrived on time and were promptly seated and provided water. After that, it was if we didn't exist for over 20 mins. The restaurant wasn't nearly full, but no servers even came near our table or even glance in our direction. We were finally able to flag someone down to order, then waited forever again hoping for our drinks, which ultimately just moments before my mom's food. I had to continue waiting an awkward amount of time for mine, to the point I had to insist she start eating before it got cold. The terrible logistics aside, once we got our food, it was quite good - thankfully! Though I'm not sure any food is really worth the frustration. My mother had the fish and chips and I had tye sticky BBQ ribs. We were both eager to clean our plates and we ended with the sticky date pudding, which could have used a little more sweetness but was still good. The rating is mostly for the food. Perhaps takeaway next time!"
Good lunch with visitor.,"While hosting a visitor in town, we went to have lunch at PS Cafe. Surprisingly it was packed but the service was good. Have a good meal and good conversation."
Nice Ambiance,"if you want a different type of scenery away from the concrete jungle, This PS cafe harding branch is the one for you. we had coffee and dessert after walking along Dempsey area. a good green scenery that will take your mind of the hustle and bustle of work life. we had some coffee and pairs with blackout chocolate cake with ice cream on the side. it has been a go to place from to time."
Family brunch,We had family brunch after little walk at Botanic Garden. Vibe was good and we wanted to stay longer if there is no plans after the meal.
Terrible Service and Extremely Overpriced,"The food is just so very average but you try and rationalize it's OK because the atmosphere is so nice and relaxed. But when you throw in awful service with outrageous pricing ($32 for Fish n Chips? Seriously?) it's all a bit much.
But again a relaxing chill place very good for a business lunch. But wait, the staff (and management as I had raised the issue with the onsite manager and he gave me a ""deer in the headlights"" look) have no clue about how to serve the food at the same time. I got my order over 15 mins before my colleague. Simply not what you expect when the bill for lunch for 2 was over $100. Hate to say it but won't be back."
Average at best,"Nice staff, nice ambience but that’s where anything positive ends. Service takes a while and food is cold when served. It’s so cold, difficult to say it’s any good.
In summary, okay to visit but don’t go out your way."
Beautiful location with delicious food,"Stunning setting amidst the forest in Dempsey. Very popular weekend spot for brunch so get there early. Everything we had was excellent. Highly recommend the Thai Chicken and the Caesar Salad. The truffle fries are large but very addictive! Velvet cake with (not too sweet) with ice cream is delicious.

Staff were friendly but we struggled to get their attention. Felt like they were understaffed.

They have a patio outside where you can can also dine, if you are ok with the Singapore humidity. Note they don’t allow dogs.

Would def go back."
Poor Service,"The food is great, but it took over an hour to get our food. We had to ask the waitress thrice on our drinks and food."
Awesome,It was awesome! The place was nice and neat. Food was good as well. Came in dec and theres abit of Christmas vibe
A PLACE TO FEEL AT HOME,"Always like the ambience of PS Cafe Hardings, surrounded by greenery and secluded.
The customer service was excellent too. Staff was wonderful to grant me my favourite table and allowed us to finish off even after they closed the station."
Always my favourite restaurant,"Had dinner with a friend from overseas. Picked P.S. Cafe as it has always been one of my favourite restaurants for many many years.
She loved everything about it, even the name of the restaurant. :)
As always, excellent food, service and ambience!"
Good Product and Professional Customer Service,"Ambience was good, service professional, food and drink of good quality.

Easy parking and restaurant in good standard."
Nice chic cafe,"Went on a weeknight around 730 PM. Place was very cozy and had that unique ambience of being in nature while remaining a stone's throw from civilisation. Nice Christmas tree and soft lighting although we sat on the patio which was just right - not too cold and no mosquitoes as well.

Service is often a make or break and you can tell in a second when a restaurant has bad (or lacklustre) service (which happens more often than expected even at higher end places). This unfortunately was not the case here - staff were polite and helpful but also refined enough not to be overbearing or intrusive. Ordered baked camembert, the mee goreng, and borrows dale pork chop. All great food that befits a cafe of this price.

One special touch was inquiring on extra bread for the Camembert which should've required an additional cover of 2 or 3 dollars. A kindly staff, however, brought us two huge pieces fresh from the kitchen free of charge without any request. This touch of hospitality was well remembered.

Overall, we spent a good 3 hours at the cafe having a good conversation, and would totally come back sometime.

P.S. By the way the washroom was good as well. Very nice (lavender?) scent with artisanal hand soaps. I typically try to avoid washrooms at cafes but this was great."
Ok,Only two salads on menu was disappointing and they were drenched in too much dressing. Could smell deep fryer fat from table
Great evening,"Food is good, ambience is great, service is excellent. The staff happily took our group photos with a smile"
Returned after 7 years,"Location and ambiente still cool, food is standard, nothing special. Service is below standards. you are not being seen by the waiters and really have to approach them to get your stuff. Sorry, expected a bit more!"
Lovely place,"Go for the ambience, especially while the sun is out so you can bask in the lush green compounds. Savoury dishes are good but not exceptional. Desserts are better."
Nice and Cozy,The whole place was nice. Food was great and the serving was big i think good for 2 to 3 persons per dish. Staff were very accommodating as well.
Great experience and smbie. Food and serving large for the big breakfast. Avocado was mashed like guacamole not sliced,"Great experience and ambience. Servings small for amount you pay, ie stacked avocado and mushroom. although big breakfast was large. The avocado was mashed like a guacamole, menu should read ‘guacamole’ rather than ‘stacked avocado’ as it’s misleading. Stacked avocado is fresher! Thks for opportunity to give feedback"
"Great Food, Great Ambience.","As always, food is always good and service is always prompt. PS Cafe Harding is always my choice to visit.

Reservation with PS Cafe is always a breeze and we can be assured of our table to be ready even when we reach slightly earlier!

Ensured everything was conveyed to us to ensure that we are aware of the daily specials and making sure we don't over order with their recommendations."
Review Sat night,"Hi i thought the food and drink was really good but the service was very slow at the start, had to ask 3 times where our drinks were."
service need reboot,The reception at the front need a serious make over. The staff was rather rude towards customers by not listening and almost ordering customers to queue in a certain manner. There were no queue pole nor directional sign to guide any customers. This really dampen the mood to the start of a lunch gathering. I also witness the same conduct extended to another customer. This really upsets me.
"Great Food, Brutal Service",I wanted to really like PS. Cafe but the terrible service put a sour taste in our mouths. We had to go to the bar twice to order drinks given that we were invisible to the staff and after an hour and 15 minutes we gave up on getting our entrees and asked for them in a take away box to mitigate ruining the rest of our afternoon.
Nice ambience to unwind a hectic week,Nice ambience to laze around. Have a meal and chit chat with friends and unwind down in the later afternoon of a Friday.
Best place in Singapore,"This has got to be the best venue in Singapore. We went for lunch at 1pm, and sat outside. It was sensational. Highly recommended."
Lunch with wife and kids,"Went to celebrate my wife's birthday . The location is good , one of the first cafes at Dempsey . Got a table right next to the kitchen door so lot of commotion around .
Even though I had mentioned while booking the reason for our visit there was nothing special from the cafe.. not sure whether this is something they should offer .. as in some acknowledgment of the birthday ? .. food is great , the portions are nice and very well cooked too.. the staff can't offer any personal attention .. I am guessing because the cafe is always packed .."
worst service ever,I visit ps cafe a lot for brunch and dinner. and I experienced my worst serice in 6 years. I don't know if the day I went was low-manpower but the indian lady was the worst ever. Her attitude literally ruined our dinner with fine food and atmosphere. I won't be visiting Harding PS Cafe for sure
Tasty food but service and speed of making the food disappointing,One of my favourite places for lunch due to the setting and tasty food but I was disappointed by the service (the staff wasn't very attentive) and how slow the food came out of the kitchen (just under an hour)
Disappointed.,Used to be one of our favourite restaurants. Service was awful and we had to return one of our meals as it wasn’t cooked!
Lovely place. Awesome for Pictures.,"The place was awesome, surrounded by greenery.
Toilet wise, there's only 1 toilet cubicle each for male and female.
Some of the cushions looks dirty and stained.
Kinda pricey in terms of value of the food. We came here for dinner."
Delicious food,"Been here a few times and its always excellent. High standard of food and service.

Their dessert is especially excellent.

The ambiance of this particular PS. Cafe is amazing, fantastic to go for a lunch or brunch."
Fab service and food,"Lovely staff, accommodating and polite. Food was fresh & delicious.

Service was prompt and with a smile"
Good service,"The staff at Harding on the 19th of August and 20th August were wonderful. They were accommodating to my request, the music was too loud, but they lowered the volume. We were having a meeting. People are not there for the music I believe. A place to sit and talk when the music is louder than the voices we cannot converse."
Expensive Food with Slow Service,"The menu has limited food choices for lunch and the dishes are overpriced. Service is slow and my crab tart tasted like dry overbaked flour. Overall, PS Cafe Harding does not live up to the hype of being a cafe that is always crowded."
Very average experience,"There is an obvious drop in standard and quality of the food - especially the steak frites, it has so much tendon it is inedible, so that was disappointing. Overall atmosphere of PS Cafe Harding is still wonderful. Service quality has also dropped although the same can be said of most F&B due to manpower shortage everywhere."
"Good food, good ambiance, great staff members!",Enjoyed my dining experience over at PS Cafe Harding. I got to enjoy the delicious meals served to us while feasting our eyes on a very relaxing view. The staff members were also awesome!
Good services and great food.,"Second time coming to the cafe, the service crews was attentive and awesome. They were friendly as well! Food was really good too!!"
service needs to improve. chocolate cake was not up to standard,"It was a birthday celebration and requested by the birthday boy to celebrate at Harding. Arrived on time and waited, waited at the reception for anyone to take notice of us. after a good 10 min with no one to acknowledge, we saw our friend who has already arrived waiving us over. she, also waited for a good 5 min before requested to be seated. of course, no service staff noticed we arrived and had to ask for water, to order. Pasta of the day was delicious but the priced truffle fries and choco cake were let down. Truffle fries lack of any taste of truffle (forgot the oil?) and choco cake was dry (although it looked moist). the eclair was also super dry. So, for the birthday boy, PS was definitly a bit of a let down. I hope they can regroup and get back to where they were before."
Best view in Singapore!,"This is one of our Singapore favourites. The view is the best in Singapore bar none. The food and wine are good, but remember you are paying 33% for the view - and it’s worth it! We started with the scallops and kingfish from the raw bar; followed by sea bass and NZ lamb. Washed down with NZ Pinot - just perfect. Don’t leave Singapore without visiting Level33!"
Fantastic experience,Excellent food. Love the nature ambiance. Great service too! Dessert is a must and highly recommend it.
Changed,"Compared to former visits over the years the cafe has changed. The breakfast was unavailable arriving 10:05; the service was quite slow and the waiter was not easy to understand regarding english
language. Anyhow , the staff was friendly , quality is good an the place is exceptional ."
Beautiful terrace view cafe,Arrived early and was seated immediately. Orders came in as expected and do not miss their signature PS menu!
Run of the mill,"This is a very popular and busy cafe so don't expect anything too special in terms of food or service. Both are adequate however. Staff need to be called if you need attention, there is no ""anticipation"" but as I said they are busy and there time is fully taken just taking orders and delivering food. The food is what you'd expect, fairly standard cuisine and nothing very out of the ordinary. The food did arrive only ""warm"" which suggests it had been sitting for a while between being available from and kitchen and delivered to the patrons. Not an unpleasant lunch, but quite average by Singapore standards."
The hosted said I was pregnant- is this a joke.?,"Today- the hosted ignored me when I entered as she was on here phone.
Then told me I was PREGNANT !!! Then she noticed I wasn't you know being 120 pounds and all.

I have never been spoken to like that in my life! The rudest thing that was ever said to me. Why does me being pregnant or not have anything to do with you leading me to my table? Don't ever speak to me about my physical appearance. So bizarre because I don't even look it. It's not my ego, it's the fact it was the rudest thing ever and out of context.
I ask to speak to the manager when I sat down only to told that person ""is on break."" I don't think they were they just didn't want to get into trouble.

Absolutely applaud looking for the Manager to get into touch with me regarding this experience......"
Not like it was,"We’d visit this spot everytime we are back in Singapore, but this was a true disappointment. 5 of us dined here that night, 5 different meals, with 2 starters. ALL OF THEM WERE BAD. Overcooked fish, dry burgers, blend pastas. Will never be back again!"
Disappointed,Had high expectations of the cafe cos been seeing good reviews online. But was so disappointed with the food. The pasta was so over cooked. Requested for a remake which they obliged but it’s still a fail. The waitress who served our food almost spilled our food as she put the plate onto our table.
A mixed experience,"I chose PS cafe @ Harding to celebrate Mother's Day thinking this would be a lovely venue that is different to the places we usually go to. The locale is beautiful, but we were smacked by a wall of noise once we stepped into the beautiful premises. Mum was, quite unfortunately for the cafe, sensitive to noise, so we requested to move to a table at a corner that was a bit away from the noise. This wasn't entertained immediately and it took repeated endeavours from me to persuade the PS team to move us. Food was good, if only the restaurant was more soundproof, or more empathetic to our needs, we would have enjoyed it even more."
Great morning teatime,"Outdoor seats are aweson green view and can lelax a lot. lots of flowers are in restaurant, fragrance of flower in restaurant and toilet too are so nice in there."
chill brunch/breakfast,Very nice ambience and views. Chill and quiet in weekday mornings. Coffee is okay. Not outstanding. Breakfast (PS club sandwich) comes with a big portion and is very delicious
Worst Impossible Burger I had had,"Visited on 6th May. Ordered the Impossible Burger thinking it will be as good as the Fullerton and Great World” outlets, but I was super disappointed it was almost tasteless and charred-less.

Other non PS cafe eatery even tasted better than this one. DO NOT ORDER ONE HERE."
Perfect Setting,"Harding has never failed to deliver on a superlative dining experience. Gorgeous setting, fairly priced gourmet menu, friendly service."
Disappointing & Embarrasing,"My friend was visiting Singapore and I wanted to take her to a signature restaurant in Singapore so I booked the PS Cafe Harding. Turns out, it was so disappointing and embarrassing. The staff are very rude - they look at you when you call them but turns away, request for something but they never come back. This happened last time when I was there, but assumed because it was a busy Friday afternoon. This time, I visited on a Monday afternoon when it was not even full and same thing happened. I am never going back again."
Good food while it lasted,"Great ambience
Tables not too close together in a soaring light filled space
Watch out for the mosquitoes even indoors !
Last orders taken very early
Wait staff are frequently occupied with other things with backs to the customers and the floor.
Eventually I gave up and just got my own plates and walked up to them to place am additional order"
Very good,"Went for monthsary celebration , we enjoyed the food and atmosphere . Service was excellent, everything was perfect . Ultimate fugy brownie was yummy"
Good ambience,"Other than ambience.. nothing is fantastic. Service is quite slow maybe due to lack of manpower. Raise my hand to take order but waitress who acknowledged totally forgot abt me and serving other clients first until I need to seek her attention again.

And we also think they missed out our order until we need to clarify with them again."
understaff,the general service is good and staff were attentive. it would be better if there are more staff to attend to needs of patrons
Very slow service.,Overall a very nice place but with an extremely slow service. We stayed around 10 minutes waiting at the reception then another 15 minutes to have a waiter coming to our table and approximately another 10 minutes to get our coffee. Perhaps they are understaffed and this seems to be affecting the service quite significantly.
Great outside ambience,"Food was unfortunately mediocre. New style inside with the huge menu boards and white lighting gave a canteen atmosphere so I am glad to have been seated outside, which is a lovely spot among the trees at night with decent fans and ethereal lighting. Shame last orders were before 9.30pm on a Saturday night."
Great luncheon experience,"Gorgeous setting, the food at PS Café never disappoints, regardless of the location. It's fresh, tasty and well presented and the reason I keep returning. Service should improve with more training, more attentive to customers who shouldn't be calling the staff for service."
Very good food and service,"We were attended to almost immediately and brought to our table. Since it was humid, we chose to be seated indoors. The waitress who attended to us throughout the night was very polite, attentive and helpful. I do feel annoyed at myself for not taking note of her name to compliment her here. Overall, the food dishes were great and complimentary water was also served. Make sure you try the dessert options. We ordered the sticky date pudding and it was awesome."
Picturesque,"It’s the perfect location for a cosy and scenic hangout, celebration or meal! It was not too noisy to have some warm conversations, and I would definitely return to try the dishes and desserts I have yet to, with different groups of people!"
Not worth a visit,Unfriendly staff and expensive food. Not worth the value as there are better family friendly restaurants nearby. Avoid.
Freaking slow service,"Slow service, food took almost more than 30 minutes to arrive. Asked for bill also took more than 10min. Horrible."
Amazing!,"Loves the ambience, first time to visit the place yet had a great time and experience. Overall satisfied with friendly services, tasty foods and the vibes!"
Veg pesto pasta,Pesto pasta was full of broccoli and was very bitter. No salt at all. Other items were fine specially the chocolate cake
Pleasant dining experience,The ambience was great and food was good. We were attended to by Cherry and Khojie and their service was excellent. The other staff were also very friendly and cheerful. Overall it was a very pleasant dining experience.
Dinner at PS Cafe Harding,"Setting is lovely as we dined outdoors. Arrived at 6.30pm and a handsome rooster was making his presence known amongst the shrubbery. The spicy prawn pasta was great , the crab tart was decent but the fish ( part of fish and chips set) was a let down. The batter was not crisp and the fish was a tad dry. The fish and chips is our favourite at PS, and we felt quite let down that day. Dessert was profiteroles and we enjoyed that very much. Our friend ordered the brownie and she was overwhelmed at the sheer size of it, and struggled to finish it."
PS Harding,"My only suggestion is to train staff to improve service levels. Out of the whole team on duty, only 2 seemed like trained servers.

Arrived and hostess at door mentioned there isn’t any coffee today. I had to ask her why would a cafe that serve breakfast not have coffee? She then clarified that the machine broke down this morning. What would have created a better first impression at the door is to explain that machine broke down and they are looking into getting it fixed so at the moment, cannot serve coffee.

We sat down and told them we were disappointed that there is no coffee. They inform us once the coffee machine is fixed they’ll let us know right away. Nobody informed us, I had to rely on hearing the machine whistle to then ask them coffee ready to be served.

We were also served tea with no teaspoon even though we asked and were served black tea with sugar. Water alone took us a few raise of hands to have it served to us.

It didn’t look like the ratio of manpower vs patrons were off but clearly there is a gap with service standards."
Great service,Thanks to Melody for making the trip such a good one she has an amazing service attitude and she Remembered me even after months!
Lunch Meeting,"Unfotuanately, i did not get to order my favorite dish and the menu was also limited. Food was also average."
Food quality is quite normal. Service and atmosphere is good.,"Food quality is quite normal. Service and atmosphere is very good. When you do reservation, always show limited time slot available, but in reality, when you walk in, you still can find seats available"
Lush greenery and great service,"We came for brunch on a Sunday 11am, no reservations. The Recep was v patient, bless her! As I wanted an outdoor seating, hubby wanted indoor, we couldn't decide and she suggested indoor as sky was getting gloomy. We were seated indoor by the glass door so we still enjoyed the lush greenery. Then the server David was v attentive, prompt in taking our orders and later in bill settlement. A very pleasant brunch for us today. Will def come back next time for the outdoor seating!"
"A bit noisy, but yummy food","It was very crowd during lunch time, many walk-in customers were rejected by the receptionist. We had reservation at 1.45pm, but only got a table after 2pm. It was a little bit noisy, only quieter after 3.30pm. Food and drinks are good."
Service,"Service was very bad, we have called few times informed regarding the suprise birthday celebration to customer service line they said the Harding restaurant has noted about it. They said they have make the note and end of the day they will bring the dessert with candle and Happy Birthday note but the desserts came twice without anything. When the first time they brought the dessert i did told them about birthday celebration yet the second time they bring without anything. Lapses in communication and when i made the complain the customer service was rude. The day was ruined. I hope this situation wouldn't happen to anyone who excited for birthday celebration."
"great location, friendly staff","Food is fantastic, although it's a bit pricey. This branch is surrounded by lush greenery and I prefer this much more than other brunch locations in the city. The air con is strong and it can get pretty cold indoors. So, guys, look out for your date and lend her a jacket if she needs one :)"
perfect for coffee and dessert date,"PS Cafe was recommended to us from one of our friend. The best location to view the spectacular greenery. We came for simple lunch and celebrating my partner's birthday. Excellent service from the crew & special thanks to Cherry for her extremely friendly,approachable & attentive service."
Love Truffle fries,"Must order truffle fries, one of my favorite cafe ! Everything was smooth even reservation team helpful ! Really appreciate your excellent service"
Mila's service is commendable,"We were greeted by the warm welcome and smiles of Mila and she was very helpful in shifting us to a table indoors when it suddenly poured heavily.

The food and ambience are great, as always."
Restaurant review,"My favourite restaurant in Singapore, with stunning outdoor seatings and high floor the ceiling glass windows/ curtain wall allowing natural lighting and beautiful view of the greens! Staffs are super attentive Especially Ms Milla who went the extra mile to accommodate to our request! Will be coming more often! It’s a feel good place !"
Kudos to the Staff!,"What a great day to start the month of October being served by the most welcoming and great staff of PS Cafe Harding. It was a cozy restaurant with great food and great service done by Mila, Martin and Cherry! Kudos to your outstanding service! Thank you very much! My friend and I had a great time at the restaurant and will surely come back. Kudos and cheers! :)"
"Great Ambiance, Great Service & Friendly Staff","I had a great time dining. Even when I’m solo, the staffs (especially Ms. Cherry Pie), are accommodating and the service was superb! Cherry was very attentive to customers need and really go an extra mile with her service! Will definitely recommend to friends and family!☺️"
"friendly staffs,with nice interior","Amazing restaurant,entrance flowers looks so unrealistic but its real indeed,ambience so lovely or it just not busy day. We ordered the roasted chicken, and Aglio pasta food was so good,and we also enjoyed the Aperol for two,and what makes even beautiful is staffs are so friendly and attentive;most specially to our server Cherry who served our lunch perfectly!"
Very Unpleasant Experience,"Huge disappointing experience
Unprofessional staff, one by name of Ashley
Total lack of courtesy, customer service
All staff preparing to close cafe 1.5hours before published closing time at 10pm
Customers being asked to leave 30min before published closing time at 10pm is unacceptable"
Visit with family,"We visit PS very often but this visit was a disappointment. The service was very bad till we had to complain about it. We always look forward to the drinks, specially the sangria but unfortunately that was also not too. To add to it, the table assigned was right next to the servers counter n at 1 point food was almost dropped on us as there was 1 person working the till and another trying to pass with a full tray between them n the chair. Overall a bad experience n if not for PS where we know the service is better, I would not go back to the place"
Lovely setting with nice food and good service,"First time at this location (the other time being at East Coast). Food was very good (Green Goddess vegetarian pesto with chicken and a Caesar salad). The pasta was very tasty and substantial. The Caesar salad had very fresh prawns and also very substantial. For drinks, the 1 for 1 cocktail didn't suit me as I was not used to the flavor. The outdoor setting was breezy, filled with bird song and the weather was very kind that morning. The wait staff were professional and knowledgeable about the dishes. Overall, I would return for seconds!"
service,"Whilst the restaurant manager was trying to be nice, the overall experience was terrible due to timings. Arriving at 8.15 and immediately being told that last service is at 9pm......I thought it was 10.30 closing, so maybe last order at 10.....but no, earlier and earlier. When we ordered and into our mains, the waiter came at about 9.30 for settlement of the bill......
For us we do not go out to get fed.....if needed we eat at home or we go to a food court. The restaurants are there to have a good and relaxing time.....
This has become unbearable in Singapore......very sad, as long timers we always enjoyed the outdoor settings etc....but now, eating in a restaurant becomes a joke....."
Great dining always~*,Superb service! Good food (the roast chicken is excellent!! and recommended wine was really good!! Didn’t have dessert cause we were heading to ice museum
Great overall dining experience,"Good Food, great ambience and excellent service...please keep up your service standards. We plan to go back for brunch soon!!"
"Good food and location, poor customer service","The cafe is lovely and the food is generally very good, if pricey. Unfortunately they just can't seem to get staff to deliver a customer service experience that lives up to the standard of the cafe. It dtracted greatly from my enjoyment of this lovely cafe in beautiful surroundings."
Great service,Great service by HafiZ. Food could be better. Steak frites was flavourful but fish and chips were dry. Good wine selection
Excellent staff service,Chun Xiang and Shan are very dedicated and attentive employees. Valuable assets indeed. It has been a very enjoyable experience.
Quick Bite,"Arrived at the P.s Cafe in Dempsy and was warmly
welcomed by Hafiz the manager on a rainy day. We had a quick coffee and delicious sandwich, our server Mila was great, never letting our water glass get empty. Thanks guys for the great start to the day."
An evening with the gals,"I recommended my friends from the East to come to PS cafe for specially for the desserts and sangria... We ordered impossible burger and tandoori lamb ribs and for dessert we ordered sticky pudding and flourless orange cake.....these were delicious.... sadly the sangria and mojito were not good .. we were disappointed! I apologized and realized that the standard for the drinks have dropped in ps cafe... I have always ordered sangria and have recommended it to friends since for many years... Last year, I went to ps to raffles city...and the sangria was bad....so diluted...so I that it's only that outlet...once I tried at Harding Rd....I knew that the standard for sangri has dropped...it not rich with wine and fruits anymore...."
Another one bites the dust,"Used to be my favorite restaurant for many years. Went back for the first time since Covid started and it will be my last. Food came so fast, it was obviously prepared in advance and thrown in a microwave. Flavors were bland and unbalanced. Even their famous desserts weren’t satisfying at all. PS Harding is a great example of what can happen when a great restaurant is sold by its caring founders to an institutional owner who is clearly just milking - and destroying- the brand. Pity."
We will come back - again and again and again and …,"Beautiful setting in the green - perfect for an early dinner during sunset: the food is great, the service very friendly and efficient"
service and attention to diners needs much improvement,"Despite multiple request for additional sharing cutlery as well as orders reminded, i need to reach out to different staff to request the same thing. Getting the staff's attention is almost impossible.
Even though i am a huge fan of the truffle fries and dessert, i wont return for the visit as the service standards is a put off for the entire experience."
"Reopening after semi ""lockdown""","Ordered the crab tart, king prawn aglio olio, and truffle fries. These were usually good, but it was rather disappointing this time round. Food was bland, texture in in the crab tart was all wrong. The herbs in the crab tart just didn't come through, and it smelled like catfood.
Truffle fries were good!"
Lovely Ambience but Very Average Food,The burger was extremely greasy. The steak frites left a fair bit to be desired - the sauce lacked flavour and it was frites with a little bit of steak not the other way around
Dinner Dessert,The experience was very good! Cherry was very accomodating and extended extra assistance to us. We enjoyed our time at PS Cafe.
