Awesome,"Little on the pricey side but great food, good cocktails and friendly service. Would definitely come back!"
"Friendly ambience, good food","Went for a business lunch and was plesantly surprised by the food quality. The staff knows the food items well and was quite attentive. The ambience is quite friendly too, vibrant for a nice business lunch."
Great food around party people,"The hummus and babaganoush platter is must have, the lamb shank shakes off its meat as tenderly as it can be, the spiced rice is amazing. Sangria is so good but harmless to a baby. The sstaff are sweethearts. Right in the heart of the bustling street around China Sq, so loud music and chatter is expected. Spent SGD 90 per pax. Will be back for more!"
"Again & Again, the best Middle Eastern Restaurant in Singapore","Glad to start the new year with a nice dinner and friends gathering at Kazbar. Food is the best Arabian Food in Singapore, cold/ hot Mazze, kebabs, fattoush, and not to forget the friendly staff and nice atmosphere :-)"
Thank you for nice surprise,"Nice ambient, good food and amazing staff, we were celebrating birthday and restaurant came with really nice surprise for us! thank you for making our experience special"
Mighty Delicious Mediterranean Food & Great Service,"We received a recommendation to try the food here. We made a lunch reservation beforehand. Less than 1min from our arrival we were shown to our reserved table. The restaurant was crowded with the lunchtime crowd. As this was our 1st time here, we didn't really know what to order. We were served by Mr Thiaga who was very knowledgeable with his suggestions. We had a starter of 'Cold Mezzeh Platter' consisting of an array of delicious homemade dips with pita bread followed by a 'Mixed Grill Platter' of lamb chops, shish taouk, shish kebab, lamb & chicken koftas. Finally for dessert we had 'Muhalabiya' it is rose water and pistachio bread pudding to cleanse our palate."
Dining experience good checkin not so good,We reached the restaurant at 10 mins past and at exactly 15 mins past when it was our turn in the queue the person told us that we are late.. wasnt a great welcome. Their food is good although a bit overpriced. Service is fantastic.
Dinner at Kazbar,"Have been for dinner with family many times. So took the clients for Corporate Dinner. There was another big group having an event. Nobody was bothered to attend or entertain us, Even the food served was not up to mark. Left as very bad experience with me and will think twice before going again."
Great service,"I think that to be a great restaurant, it cannot soley rely on the food, but also the customer service and atomsphere. The food was really tasty, the grilled meat were tender, the ambience was so so, but the customer service was excellent. We had a waiter named Thiaga (the name badge flashed by too fast), who was funny, entertaining and attentive. He made us laugh and talked about football and gave recommendations to food choices. We would come back again, if he was serving us."
Awesome food,Amazing food though the service could have been better. While ordering you do not get the feeling of being wanted in the restaurant.
Authentic Middle Eastern Food,"The only authentic middle eastern food in Singapore, hits the spot every single time ! Highly recommended!"
Amazing Middle Eastern Food,I am Lebanese myself and in my opinion this is the best lebanese food you can get in Singapore. Just authentic and delicious. Geat service too! Thanks you
Dinner on a friday,"I haven‚Äôt been back to Kabra for a few years and had dinner last friday. Food was amazing and portions were generous, probably makes the best lamb chops. We have the mix grill, feta salad and the mint and cucumber yoghurt and dessert. Not only was the food good the service was equally amazing. Definitely going back again. Post Covid i would say this was best food and service combination"
"good food, great service","had the set lunch, which had big portions and very tasty. But the service was excellent. We got a 'cave' which was nice and private."
Birthday celebration,"Managed to get the booking done though it was last minute! It was a wonderful experience celebrating my daughter‚Äôs birthday at Kazbar. The food was amazing & the suggestions given by Mr.Thaygu were so apt for the group size. He was too good helping us suggest the best food.
Most memorable thing the team did was to play a birthday song. It was the best birthday celebration at Kazbar."
A popular place,"Hello, although a popular place as it was super crowded on a Thursday evening, it felt like I was in a fish market. The place was brimming with office goers chilling after work. I didn't expect this kind of noisiness and crowd on a Thurs evening. The food was good and staff was co-operative. Not my type of place for a quiet dinner date with my hubby."
"Good Food, OK Service","Food was good, however the service wasn‚Äôt up to the level. The attendant took lot of time to confirm the order."
Good Food But Terrible staff!,"We used to visit this place quite often, but after today‚Äôs experience, have decided not to go anymore. It started pouring heavily and the staff didn‚Äôt bother to move us to different table even when there were tables available which could seat 3 people. After standing for quite sometime, the staff came and asked us if we are okay to move with another family with an attached table. We were uncomfortable. One of the staff members told us he can give us a different table and we would have to leave before 745pm. When we told him we were unsure of the time we would leave, he asked us if we were planning to stay beyond 745pm. @Kazbar management - if you do not want people staying longer, do let them
Know what is the timeline you guys have before people book for their evening or put it on your website. Don‚Äôt let your staff dictate the time we should spend at the restaurant. It was an unpleasant experience and spoilt our evening mood.

Bottom line- we will never visit this place again!"
Great food! Great portion!,Great food! Great menu! Nice staff! Do have some tomato ketchup for the french fries please. Will recommend my friends.
Best in Town,"Best middle eastern food in town. I been to almost every restaurant in Singapore. As a Jordanian, I can safely say that no restaurant even come close to Kazbar in service and quality of food provided."
Great Food / Great Service,"Lunch set menu is perfect - no matter the occassion. Reserve a table tho, if you dun want to be dissapointed."
Never Fails to Amaze!,This is my go to place for mediterranean cuisine whenever I have dates or overseas friends in town. Amazing food and the fabulous service always leaves me leaving with a smile. What more is there to it?! Thanks Thiyaga & staff for the wonderful dining experience!
Always a favorite!,"Kazbar is one of the best Middle Eastern restaurants with a wide variety of choices, and all delicious! The quality is consistent (always good) and it‚Äôs so reliable! But you need to reserve - it‚Äôs always full whether lunch, drinks, or dinner. Their manager is friendly and waiter Thiaga is kind enough to recognize me and make me feel at home."
A wonderful experience!,"Fabulous food, friendly and attentive service, the bar was bustling outside but inside it was quiet and spacious enough to be comfortable and converse easily, what more can you ask for?"
7 Days to hold a $200 deposit? - Really?,"Food was good. All meals were paid. But I just find that the restaurant withholding my deposit of $200 for 7 days, even after the meal was paid, a very ridiculous thing to do. Kazbar, please DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS!"
"Love the food, but not enough staff","One of my favourite places , but during lunch rush they are short on people and nobody is checking in on you if you want anything or trying to make an eye contact with waitstaff."
Fantastic food with great ambiance,"Authentic Lebanese cuisine in the heart of the CBD. Kazbar is always lively, because of the hospitality of the staff and the crowd. And the food is the best in Lebanese food you get in Singapore. Mezze, grills, wraps - all are delicious. Hummus is to die for and the condiments are just perfect. Baklawa is a must to finish the meal. Visit with a hearty appetite."
Superb,"Had gone on a Saturday evening for dinner, We had outdoor seating and the ambience was very good. We are vegetarians and were helped by Ash bwho was very helpful is suggesting and a great host as well. We loved what she recommended. Food was great and so was the ambience"
Just go,"Kazbar has been a fantastic stalwart of China Square and Singapore for years, I had my 35th birthday celebration there and that was over 17 years ago! I have been many, many times. It's a great location and the service is always good and it is run professionally. Food is fantastic, mezze and kibbeh are wonderful, the lamb chops are arguably the best in Singapore (they are consistently succulent and mildly spiced) and I am including top fine dining restaurants in my assessment as well. I have had most items over the years on their menu, last Wednesday 2 of us had some mezze and the mixed grill platter, it was very tasty (and especially with those lamb chops in there!).

They do a very reasonable set lunch as well (maybe too much rice sometimes) and desserts are beautiful if you like the Mid East selections. Their coffee is excellent quality, the beers are always cold and fresh (excluding bottled they serve a range of 4 on draft that just about covers what you need - 2 lagers inc Stellar, London Pride and Hoegaarden). If there is an Achilles heel I would say it is the wine selection however it might be they do corkage, I have never checked.

Moving on to atmosphere, it is almost always lively with the business crowd in force. It is also a great place to just sit and people watch as they walk past both at lunch and in the evening. I would say go along and try it out, I very much doubt you will regret it!"
Fantastic food as always for decade plus,Kazbar‚Äôs authentic and mouthwatering food is the reason I have been a regular patron of Kazbar for a very long period.
Food was good but ‚Ä¶,"Food is always good but I was denied sitting in a requested area. I wanted a particular waiter and requested to sit in his area but despite having open tables, my request was denied. I had to ask for drink refills and again for the bill. Staff were busy chatting amoungst themselves vice serving. This is the first time this has happened so will chaulk it up to who was running the floor that day. I‚Äôll try again but if I get the same treatment, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll go elsewhere."
Delicious,Enjoyed! Food was delicious. We enjoyed eating all what we ordered. Will definitely come back with family and friends.
Love this place and I‚Äôve already told everyone!,"Friendly staff, fresh food, great drinks, GREAT playlist and a clean bathroom! What else could a person ask for?!"
Kazbar delivers!!,"We had a friend in town from Australia, he was in town on a work trip. During the pandemic we had ordered lots from Kazbar and we found the food excellent. We went for the first time in person on Saturday and the air was electric. The vibe was wonderful and the staff and the food truly excellent. I highly recommend a visit to Kazbar!!"
Lunch at Kazbar,"It was a birthday lunch which Kazbar make so special. Food was excellent, I had the set lunch and I felt they shd give less rice as I can see a lot of wastage. Other than than I always love going to Kazbar"
Lovely experience as always,Food was lovely and so was the service as always. Food options for vegetarians are great and delicious
Definitely going back!,Wonderful food and amazing service. Wasn‚Äôt expecting much because the street is more famous for its bars than cuisine. Wonderfully surprised and definitely going back. Do ask for their selection of Syrian Reds. And the mixed dips and mixed grill were spot on!
Delightful!!,It was a very nice experience at Kazbar our second time. The cold mezze and the spicy bread was a great combination. Also the mutton kebabs were super delicious. Next time would love to try the hot mezze and the attractive desserts.
Nice place and good food.,"Good place to chill out . The food is good and staff is attentive and provide good service, will go again!"
A Walk In Surprise Middle Eastern Rest.,"Service 5. Ambience 4. Price 4. Food 5.
Decided to eat herr one evening on a weekday despite no resetvation after through all the other restaurants. It was absolutely the right choice. Service was excellent, with the waiter recommending their best dish which was lamb chops and hummus. The lamp chop was 6 out of 5, best ever, tender, tasty, with just the right spice. Hummus also great. Service was spectacular, they even remembered my name when I booked a table and visited again with my 2 grandchildren 2 days later. And the children even had 2 complimentary very tasty ice cream scoops of pistachio and dates. What a wonderful evening."
Great for sharing!,"Great food and service, even with manpower shortage. For 4 pax, we had mixed mezzah, mixed grill platter, fish and prawn tahini tajine; very filling. Poison Sumac cocktail was yumz Desserts are really sweet, would rcmd to share"
Not so good.,"I went there having read positive reviews, the food consumed is quite good but not spectacular, whilst the service is kind and quick .
We have chosen a plentiful appetizer, a main course with chicken and another with lamb chops, it was good but not abundant for such a price.
I will try again but I expected better for more than 100 SGD.
The restaurant is in decorated in typical Meddle Eastern style in the Center of Telok Ayer."
Bad experience with food,My wife surprised me for my birthday by organising lunch at Kazbar on the 14th Jan 2022 at 1pm. We had a nice waiter who served us named Thiaga and he recommended some dishes for us. All the dishes were good except for the Fish and Prawn Harrah. The prawn was very overdone and it was really hard to chew. I brought this up to Thiaga and he said he‚Äôd let the chef know. He didn‚Äôt get back to us at all. The chef didn‚Äôt come to see us about it either. When we paid we still had to pay for the Fish and Prawn Harrah. When I asked Thiaga about this he just shrugged his shoulders. It was a disappointing experience for my 50th birthday surprise lunch.
Splendid experience,"Beautiful ambience. Served well with the best server's ,an Indian bearded chap who guided us with his recommendations and we had a Walla time at kazbar. Thank you Kazbar for the experience."
Simply the best!,Never really experienced middle eastern food but Kazbar opened my eyes and made me realise what I was missing out on! Special shout out to the local staff (i think) Thioogo who was very friendly and gave great suggestions on what to eat. Restaurant itself was themed perfectly to match the style of food which further elevated the total experience. Just WOW. Looking forward to returning!
Good food and great service,Recently visited Kazbar with two little kids who can be quite handful. The servers were patient and professional. Food was good and overall we had a very pleasant experience.
Year End and Weekend,"Thank you so much food was good, ambience is good, and staff is very friendly. Warm welcome. Appreciate it."
Great experience!,"I was there to celebrate my hubby‚Äôs birthday. It was our first visit to Kazbar. Mr Thiaga was attentive to our needs. He made sure that we did not
order too much. Explained clearly when we were unsure about certain food items. Thank you!

Ordered lamb chops and it was simply fabulous! Sangria was great too The staff even surprised my hubby with a birthday song and a dessert!
Truly a wonderful night we had at Kazbar.

We will return for another meal! Thank you Kazbar staff for the yummy food, friendly service and great atmosphere!"
Business Lunch,"As usual, my experience at Kazbar is always excellent. I love the Authenticity of the food and the quality. The taste is always consistent. Staff are professional and make me feel at home. Thank you so much."
Enjoyable Experience,"The food was big portions and delicious. Fantastic service as the friendly manager would come by to check how we were doing. Very spacious and lovely environment. Overall, my friends and I enjoyed our dinner there."
The Kazbar Experience,"Loved everything at Kazbar. The food was delicious especially the lamb. The service staff were helpful, efficient and hospitable. We received a complimentary dessert that we polished off immediately. Only problem was they had to close early at 1030:( would definitely go again!"
Excellent Middele Eastern Food,"This vegetarian friendly restaurant offering food from the Middle East was really excellent. The grilled dishes were cooked to perfection with juicy interiors. Great selection of wine & drinks. Good ambience, friendly staff. Will visit again."
Fabulous Time!,"Great food, attentive staff and great ambience. What more does a person needs to welcome in the weekend?! Thanks Kazbar!"
Amazing food fare and service!,This was an amazing experience and my new favorite restaurant. I love Lebanese food and lamb and this restaurant delivers on both fronts and more! The food was perfect and the staff were so friendly! The bartender delivered on the best white sangrias I had ever tried! Do try their meat platters and mezza platters when you visit them and bring a group of friends to share the delicious food fare. I will definitely be coming back and will recommend this place for the beautiful food experience and lovely ambience.
"Fantastic food, lovely atmosphere!","Cold mezzeh and shish kebab are a must try! Red wine sangria was brilliant as well. Great food, great ambience, prices were decent as well given the portion size. Quite possibly my favourite dining in experience, will definitely be returning!"
Wow!,What a great experience. My friends and I enjoyed wonderful food with great ambiance and super service. We are already planning our next treat at Kazbar.
the manager is rude,"the owner? manager? is rude, Angelina, - the way she speak is blunt, and she was literally taking away the plates and glasses interrupting the conversation without any comment. Either she doesn't have social sense or she doesn't really care about the service and manner. Also because of her the water was spilled on my friend's clothes, but she didn't say sorry at all, and ignored - completely it ruined the mood."
Date with my friends!,Teva was awesome! Will definetely come here again for Teva! The food that he recommend was good for a group of friends! :)
Great service,"Great service by Teva, he was very hospitable and recommended us really great food! Would definitely come back again!"
"Good food, drinks, ambience & service","Food plus ambience, just perfect. Teva & Sienna took good care of us and because of their service we booked table for t e very next day as well. It was two days in a row for usü•Ç"
For an Amazing dinner Night Out,"The place was amazing! The hummus was just superb. Server were all friendly and nice but the person who stood out was Teva. Such warm hospitality, I‚Äôm also impressed about his knowledge with the menu. He‚Äôs given us detailed explanation of every food we ordered and all his recommendations were amazing! Truly a gem"
Great food and service,Food was nice presented and taste was good. Enjoyed the hot mezza sampler and hummus. The grilled lamb cubes were tender and had the right level of charred-ness. Server took time to explain the food were they were served. Place was well kept and clean.
Can eat and drink until Toh.,"Wah, I tell you ah this place the martini damn power leh. Very shiok‚Ä¶ and bang for buck. Kena 2 I flying already‚Ä¶ kena 4 I say hello to Elon Musk on the moon Liao. For 2 guys, order 1 small dip, then the mixed grilled platter‚Ä¶. Very very shiok. Eat the baby lamb chops with the hand like caveman Lagi best, can KFC already‚Ä¶ finger licking good. Then kena some martinis‚Ä¶. Also the poIson sumac pomegranate margarita (don‚Äôt worry ah, not poison ok!!). FOOOYOH! Sit outside is the best. Service is damn good‚Ä¶. Kazbar time is happy time!!! Some people say expensive but I pay that price at other ‚Äúfancy‚Äù restoren eat like bird only. Here, wallet still got money but stomach no space. I come again ah!!!!"
Amazing food!,"First time here, and we absolutely enjoyed everything. Staff were very accommodating as well. Would definitely go back."
Excellent Food and Service!,My only regret is...I didn't went enough while living in Singapore. Delicious food with an excellent service! Definitely a MUST GO !
Awesome.. Very nice...,"Went there with family... the Indian uncle, can't remember his name... so very helpful and friendly... food awesome... ambience awesome.. very satisfied... will revisit"
"Great food, ambiance and value !",Simply my favourite to enjoy a great dinner. The Lebanese menu whether for cold or hot dishes is just fantastic and simply can't avoid the Tabbouleh.
Excellent dinner,I have Lebanese origins . I can sincerely witness that our dinner last Friday 7th of May was excellent . Clearly the chef is Lebanese and have a great mastery of Lebanese spices . BRAVO
Delectable Platters,"Bday party order.
We went for the Mezzeh Platter and Mixed Grill Platter.

The delivery was smooth and the food was delectable. Everything was prepared well and we enjoyed every bit of the platter. Everyone was happy and was full of praises.

I would like to specially mention the lamb chops which were heavenly and they never tasted better.

Definetly ordering for the next house party too."
"Fantastic Lunch, Great Service","Absolutely fantastic lunch - must visit! We had a lovely lunch today and it was just a wonderful experience. We had the cold mezze platter, mixed grill platter, baklavah and ice-cream and everything was just divine! The mixed grill was particularly amazing with a variety of flavours and treatments of the meat, and the meat was all so tender and well-cooked. We also were super impressed with our server, who was so knowledgeable about the food and wine and gave advice as to how best enjoy each platter. The vibe is so relaxed and hospitable, the food comes out fast, and it is just a really pleasant, enjoyable, welcoming place to dine. We've been a number of times before and it never fails to impress us! Well worth a visit, for sure!"
Crispy wholesome falafel,"Hands down I know I'm going to get this crispy, crunchy coating with soft fluffy centre every time. So happy to have this as a drop by snack today with their super creamy hummus and tahini dips"
Good food and excellent service!,"First time and Kazbar and we were served by a lovely gentleman (I think it was Thiga?). We had Shish Taouk, Mohammarah and Saffron and Pistachio ice cream. Our gentleman was so patient in explaining the food to us! He also made the effort to check if we were all right during our meals. One of the best experiences that we have ever gotten! Highly recommended!"
Good food and service,Kazbar is one of our favorite restaurant for middle eastern fare. portion sizes are generous and the food is delectable. service is good and prompt as well.
Generous and tasty,"This place has apparently been around for ages and I wish I had come here sooner. Although the prices aren't cheap, they were extremely generous with the portions so you should kind of judge it as 1.5 pax per meal. We had the shish kebab (lamb) and joojeh kebab (chicken). Both were grilled to the right amount of char. The flavours are strong as you would expect of Middle Eastern cuisine, but not overpowering. I prefer the joojeh kebab - it is possibly the most tender grilled chicken I've had so far, I really have no idea how they do it. The shish kebab is slightly tough, but that's expected of grilled red meat chunks. The saffron rice was great too! So good that I can eat it just on its own. So is the spicy bread, which is slightly crispy and not too spicy, just the way I like it. I didn't really like the raw onions mixed with parsley (is this the babas?) but I guess it's meant to act as a refreshing balance to the meat.

We also had the Baklava. Each piece is really tiny, but don't worry about the size. Each bite is super rich and I can clearly taste the layers of pastry, honey and crushed nuts. It's topped with additional crushed pistachio and pomegranate seeds, which accentuates both the visual impact and the taste.

Overall, I'd totally come back again."
Middle East eats without the hassle of Arab St,"Mixed in with the bars and restaurants of Church St, the food here really is a step up from the tourist traps on Arab St and the touts trying to convince you their place is best. The tastes and ingredients are truly authentic. Hot and cold mezzehs were delicious (the falefel the only slight disappointment) and the mixed grill was fantastic (the lamb chops are superb). After a break we had desert of ice cream and baklava with mint teas, that rounded off the meal perfectly. After 8 months since we left the Middle East, this did touch the spot."
"Authentic Lebanese food, wonderful staff, fun location","This is by far one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore, either for a night together as a couple, or to take friends. We have been coming here for five years now, regularly. The location in Capital Square is fun and always buzzing, but the restaurant is a nice sophisticated haven in between the other bars. The food is fresh and tasty, authentic to what we used to have in the Middle East, and consistent in quality and presentation. We have never ordered anything from the menu we didn't like. My husband and his friends like the offering of Mazaa beer, and the house wine is a good quality Lebanese wine and an extremely reasonable price. The best part is the staff who always remember us and greet us warmly, remember our favourite dishes from the menu, or are willing to recommend something new, are helpful but never intrusive. A must try."
Good is good but the dessert ruined our impression,"The Food is good, tasty and authentic.
The staff is ‚Äûdoing the Job‚Äú. No warm feeling or vibe like usually you have in a mid-eastern restaurant.
The dessert (Baklava) is a rip off!
All pieces Fitbit two mouths at $18
And not close to a Baklava. Totally dry and they use mixed nut, not walnuts or pistachios (only for decoration)
I‚Äôm from ME, so my criticism is maybe a bit tough but based on experience."
"Authentic Middle Eastern cuisine, extensive menu!","Great ambience, friendly staff, excellent service. Our go to place for middle eastern food in Singapore."
The fact that it has survived SG's F&B scene speaks for itself!,"We have been repeated customers of Kazbar since.. , year 2000?! Long way back! We have been living in and out the country, and still go back and love the place. The fact that Kazbar has survived that long in Singapore's F&B scene speaks for itself. The owner and staff have been consistently friendly, even when they are overwhelmed (e.g. recent post lockdown); the food quality has been consistently excellent - our favourite are lamb chop, the accompanied garlic sauce, and cold meze. Highly recommended!"
Authentic Lebanese food,"The best Lebanese food in Singapore, authentic, fresh and very tasty. The staff are extremely welcoming and professional. I highly recommend."
Excellent place for Dinner,"Excellent Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food and drinks! Ambience is great, service is excellent!"
19 years of serving for a reason,"Firstly, how many restaurants truly will go to the efforts to cook everything with extra virgin olive oil? when most customers don't know or care. This is testament to the efforts to create good food from quality ingredients, so matched with an authentic Lebanese menu and team effort for top service this restaurant is my go to for all occasions"
I love it.,"Kazbar serves the best vegetarian mezze platter in town. Great location, cosy atmosphere and attentive service."
Excellent kitchen,"Great food, great staff. Recommend to try musaka, meat platter, feta cheese salad. Total 100sgd, 2 people full:)"
"Awesome food, very happening environment, birthday song was a surprise üëè. Last but not least kind people and service.","I love the staff, very kind and caring. Amazing food, lamp sausage are really awesome. Visit again soon."
Wonderful time at kazbar,We all loved the dips so fresh and yummy. The grilled meats especially the lamb chops were stellar. Had the poison sumac their house cocktail and it was exotic and delicious!
Relaxed Middle East Restaurant,"Was visiting an office nearby so stopped off here today for lunch.

Restaurant operates with indoor and outdoor seating. Has a special lunchtime menu of specials for $22 which I opted for - had the lamb sheesh kebab. Added Shorba soup to start. Service was quick and efficient - seating comfortable. Portions were too large for me, but I guess that‚Äôs better than being too small. Great restaurant with a wide selection of dishes. Saffron ice cream for dessert was exquisite."
Amazing food and ambiance,We will definitely return to the restaurant. Food was great. But the spicy calamari as tasty. The chicken wings are our favourite on this visit.
Delicious Foods with Excellent Service & Nice Ambient,Will come back again for enjoying this authentic foods. Good values for money for such fresh delicious foods and draft Belgian wheat beers...
Very good food and vegetarian friendly,Nice place with a wide variety of dishes and several vegetarian options. All very good. The place is noisy though so not recommended if you expect to have a nice conversation.
A sure value,Always great food and impeccable service. One of our fav‚Äô in Singapore. Just hope the Almaza beer will be back soon üòâ
Delicious and Fantastic Service,"We went for lunch and had a fantastic time. All of the food we had (hot and cold mezze platters, baklava and ice cream) was so delicious, well-presented and proportions perfect. The place was buzzing through the whole time we were there and it was a lovely vibe. In particular our server was just excellent, so friendly and kind and professional."
Super Friendly Staff!,One of my best experiences. Staff were really friendly and service was top notch. Will definitely dine there again.
Rock The Kazbar,"The restaurant atmosphere, location and staff have earned mines and colleagues business. A most whether living in SG, visiting and have time to catch happy hour or just a simple date evening. If you like wings, definitely TRY Kazbar wings!"
Excellent Middle-eastern Food,"I must say this is one of the best places for middle eastern food. We took the hummus and the mixed grilled platter. Awesome! I love lamb chops but rarely buy at restaurants cos the meat is little and its surrounded by a thick layer of fat. Here there's no fat and the lamb chop portions are of good size and succulent. It is one of their must-try! Although we went on a Saturday, the crew were fast, attentive and polite. Food was delivered fast. Like this restaurant. Will return with friends."
Great middle eastern food in Singapore,The Food & Drinks as well as the service are really good at Kazbar. The staff is friendly and helped us with the selection of dishes.I'd totally recommend this place if you are in the mood for good food
Authentic Lebanese Food,"This is one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore. The food is authentic, reasonably priced and delicious. The staff are attentive but not overly so. It is also in a nice location where you can hear the China Square bustle but still enjoy a conversation."
Not a friday evening....,"Food is very good but too noisy on friday evening ! Music too loud inside, same outside with the other restaurant..impossible to talk to each other so not nice. Better to go on weekday or at noon"
I go to the restaurant to,"I go to the restaurant to order a takeaway as checked that the prices through delivery services are different from the menu on their website, in addition to delivery charges. When I order the food, they wanted me to order online which I found strange and fishy! They do take orders on the spot which I finally convinced them to, and found out that they overcharge for each dish for ‚Äòplastic containers‚Äô. They must be doing darn good business in this covid-19 situation when every single other restaurant is offering discounts ! Not charging more!! Worst is it was not disclosed which is a crime in singapore. When debated, I was told the extra charges are in lieu of service charges for a takeout, hahaha! Well done and all the best."
