Great Service Great Food,"The wait staff, Paul, Roy, Sitah & Moef, have been most wonderful. Their food recommendations were on point. They were attentive to our needs to. Grilled seafood platter was delicious! We'll certainly be back!"
Marvellous restaurant that one must try,"We had our 16th wedding anniversary dinner at Origin Grill. This was our 2nd visit to this restaurant and it again did not disappoint us with the marvellous service and food.

We had seafood bisque, Hokkaido scallop and tuna tartare as starter, followed by Lumina Lamb Rack and Kagoshima Wagyu as main with Japanese pumpkin as side, and finished with floating island (mango and passion fruit) as dessert. I would say that all food was amazingly and deliciously prepared by chef Nathan and his team. My wife and I were also delighted to be served by Paul and Yantin with great Shangri la way of hospitality.

Paul also took the effort in taking great photos of us during the meal, and chitchatting with us when serving the food sharing his experience and challenges overcome during the pandemic.

Thank you restaurant Origin and the team behind it in making our wedding celebration a memorable one."
"Best Quality Food and Service, Only Shangrila!","all the staff are super friendly and warm! also shoutout to Justin Lim and Shelley Leow who coordinated everything from the menu, reservation and dessert request! Also Yatin, Paul and Pei San was very nice when explaining and serving the food to our tables and also Yatin bery good in taking pictures! Thank you our family is super happy and always love Shangrila! Nothing beats the service and good quality food! By the way we love the food super esp the beef carpaccio, the wagyu beef cheek and seabass, plus the Mandarin Vanilla and Sesame the best! Love it!"
"Great Service, Great Ambience, Great Everything!","Had one of the best dinners since the COVID reopening. Food was fabulous, service (thanks to Paul, yatin, Roy and Moet!) was attentive and service was great! Had the platter for 2, the serving was generous and 2 of us were really full. The beef was done exactly to the dones we asked for. The waygu melts in your mouth. The dessert floating island is a must try, instead of the usual vanilla creme anglaise, they did a passion fruit and mango base custard and the acidity balances the sweetness of the meringue perfectly."
Amazing birthday dinner,"We had an amazing birthday dinner, food was delish, service by Paul & all the team was fantastic. We had a cooked to perfection tomahawk steak with 4 different sauces, potatoes, salad & creamed spinach. They did not have any Pinot Grigio but went and got us a bottle from the bar. Paul then surprised us with chocolate cake & candle for my birthday."
Birthday,"Have a wonderful birthday dinner here. Food is delicious and the service really good too. Paul is very helpful , he take many nice photos for us. Highly recommended :)"
Amazing curated set dinner by Britt & Team,"Origin consistently raises the bar in relation to service and food quality, at reasonable prices (considering 5 star setting and cuisine). Britt planned an unforgettable set dinner as part of a celebratory event for my colleagues and me. Delicious bespoke meal paired with wines and Origin Bar‚Äôs new cocktails. Kudos to Roy, Paul, Marcus and Rebecca for the attentive service!"

Excellent service during Christmas week,"My family of 3 had an incredible lunch at Origin Grill/Bar, Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore, on Tuesday 20 December. The festive 3 or 4 course lunch is delicious (particularly the beef tenderloin main dish and beautiful Alaska dessert with mango sherbert), and the restaurant setting is spacious yet elegantly cosy (with a view to the hotel's famed gardens). But what topped the experience is its incredible service -- personal, attentive, warm. Despite the hotel not having our lunch reservation on its system, we were allowed in and had a nice central round table. The service by Moet (originally from Myanmar) is particularly commendable. She was super attentive, always anticipating our needs (e.g. for extra serving plates to share courses, extra butter when she noticed our leftover rolls); she also suggested an extra dessert not on the lunch set (otherwise, we would have had 3 identical desserts). We were even more impressed that she had only worked at Origin for less than 2 months! Thank You Moet, and Thank You Origin and Shangri-La Singapore for a truly warm, memorable and beautiful festive lunch experience!"
Superb meal & service!,"First time here and definitely highly recommended! Portions were perfect for group sharing and service staff were very knowledgeable about the food and drinks and had good attention to detail. Thank you to Moet, Yatin, Jessica, Roy, Shelly and chefs and team!"

Our Neighborhood Upscale Bar & Restaurant,"My wife and I live in the neighborhood where Origin is located. We love the Origin Bar for cocktails, and the grill has never disappointed.

The food is quality, and the service is always top notch. Staff members like Pei San are very special. She attended to special dietary and health needs, and was able to make great recommendations on the menu. More importantly, she and others do this with great personalities that makes for a good dining experience.

When we want something a bit more special within walking distance, Origin will always be our first choice."

To celebrate Wedding Anniversary,"Both staff, Pei San and Von were attentive and had served us patiently in explaining the menu to my husband and me for our wedding anniversary lunch last Saturday 26 Nov 22. Good service thumb up for them. Unfortunately both my husband and myself had diarrhoea after we left the restaurant an hour later. We suspect it was the appetiter Beef Tartare that we ate that had caused us the stomach upset and we had to rush home instead of continuing our celebration."
Very Impressive First Visit to Origin Grill!,"Excellent quality of food, ambiance and service from Shelly, Mo√´t and Pei Shan. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal and time at Origin Grill on a Sunday afternoon!"
Beautiful Food and service in Origin grill,"I tried Origin new dishes today. That was lovely.

Great service,First visit and the service is awesome! Love the Caesar salad and great wine pairing. Worth your money
Great service and amazing dinner experience,"Recommend starter- kale salad and octopus. Both portion just nice and tasty. I enjoyed my tenderloin which

Good and nice service & food,"Regular here service and food is nice , thx for Vin help us for my booking and Shelley ,Sitha who servce me the day , but still need some comments for the food ‚Ä¶.. food is nice but the taste every time is different, my flavor is Hokkaido scallops & seafood bisques , taste no the same every time , beef is the best which is yukimuro steak , hope the chef can manage the food got the standard."
Excellent services,"Very helpful from the staff name Shelley and Pei San ‚Ä¶ good in recommendations about dessert .. also thank you the chef Autumn and her team still have Aimi , Rebecca and Marcus come out and explain for us"
Outdated,Had a tenderloin with cauliflower and Japanese pumpkin. In general mediocre food. Feels outdated. Shangri-la's flagship restaurant needs a new head chef.
Food was good but not great,"They called it farm to table, but that focus was not clear in the menu and the one steak that was grass fed and free range was not available. The food we did have was good, but pricey. The service was attentive and professional and I wish they had more to work with in the menu."
Tranquil dinner Orgin Grill for our 18th wedding anniversary,"Enjoyed a good quiet anniversary dinner at Origin Grill in midst of busy weekend. had the appetiser dish with Hudson Valley Duck Terrine. impressed with the smoothness and good blend on savour and saucs to get all taste bud senss ready for the main course. Catch of the day with fresh prawn and trout compliment well with the sauce and side. Rangers Valley Striploin was succulent and definitely above expectation. Thanks to Shelley,Rox and Britt for their service. the beautiful ambience and wide spaced tables ensure a good private anniversary dinner."

Lunch at Origin Grill Bat,"Celebrated birthday at the restaurant. The appetizer, main course and desserts were all up to mark. Also to give compliments to Paul who provided excellent service. He was patient and courteous and always with a big smile."
Lovely Experience,"Had a busy day visiting sites around Singapore so we decided to find a restaurant within the hotel - so glad we found Origin Grill. The food was lovely - we opted for risotto and sides and had an amazing bottle of wine. The staff were extremely attentive and Paul, one of the waiting staff, made the experience so much better by offering us chocolate to compliment our wine, which worked a treat! Thank you Shangri-La for allowing us this perfect dining experience."
Great service and main courses,"As usual the main courses were great. Great service from Pei San too. However, desserts will need to be improved. Had the chance to try their trial desserts but would prefer traditional sweet rather than fusion savory flavours."
Great service and delicious food,"Have an amazing dined here in my Hubby Vacation.
Food was absolutely delicious and good value. Especially the main course of the Angus Ribeye which was soft and juicy, and the Pan Roasted Seabass's skin was crackling and meat was smooth, Liked this menu very much! The restaurant has nice ambience and good atmosphere , Let us feel relax to enjoy our dining.The serving staff Paul was very attentive and thoughtful to our needs.One of the best restaurants which we were try and will definitely be back."
lovely Sunday lunch,"Dined here again to celebrate my brothers' birthday. Shelley was very welcoming. Was served by Vin and Paul who gave great suggestions and were very attentive.
Food was good especially the caesar salad, Bangalow pork chops (skin was not crackling though), mushroom risotto, steak and especially the cheese board and bluberry souffle! Liked the new menu very much! Congrats to the chef!
You have a good team of wait staff like Rox, Amanda and others. Thanks, Shoban."

Culinary Heaven,"My wife and I were fortunate enough to dine at the Origin Grill Shangri -La this evening. It was Culinary Heaven thanks to the most amazing Chef Nathan Griffin who is undoubtedly a master Chef and creative genius making the most spectacular and taste bud tantalising meals from starters main course and dessert. You can‚Äôt go wrong whatever you choose but if in doubt Shoban front of house makes for an authentic helper at both food and sommelier guidance and his charm adds warmth to the whole experience. Paul was our waiter and again he added joy and positive energy to the evening. We have loved Singapore made all the more special by Chef Nathan Griffin, Shoban and Paul all of whom are 10 stars if I could give it many thanks and best wishes Dickie and Heather"
Origins,"Paul made a great difference in our dining experience! He is very observant, upon seeing that we feel quite full, he quickly added a slice of lemon in our drink. He is also very knowledgeable on the dishes. Thank you very much!"
Great ambience and food.,Food is very good. Had the octopus and sharing platter and both were top notch. Paul was very attentive and his service was fantastic.
"Hit and miss food, but excellent service.","Excellent service from the crew.
Specially commending Paul who did a fantastic job taking care of us and 1 toddler.

Food however is a hit and miss situation.
1. Kids seabass came first and the fish was undercooked (shockingly) and they replaced with a well cooked one.
2. Starter Hokkaido scallops, tasted ok average.
3. Lobster Thermidor, we totally enjoyed it.
4. Pork chop, meat texture was dry and tough. Abit too salty. (Totally unexpected and not enjoyable at all)
5. Lastly, ice cream, ended on a good note"
Very good food and service,"We had fish and beef and both came out superb. The staff made good recommendations for the wine and the food and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The chef is friendly and we like the lady tt recommended the food and one of the servers, Paul. Great rime and great food."
Great service and delicious food,"Had an amazing dinner with my husband at origin. Their scallop was succulent and went well with their seafood Thai broth. For my main I had the ribeye which was very juicy and delicious even though I ordered it well done .
I had their silky creamy mash potatoes as a side and the green onions gave a nice textural component to it. To top off the whole meal we went with their blueberry souffle which was recommended to us. Nice warm and fluffy which went very well with the yogurt sobert. The service was outstanding they made us feel very comfortable from the moment you entered the restaurant until the very end. They were very helpful and attentive.A special thanks to Vin, Shoban , Britt and Shelley for creating an amazing dining experience. Will definitely come back again."
Dinner at origin,"Went to have dinner at origin for the first time and was warmly welcomed by all of the staff. Had the octopus to start and it was very lovely and nicely charred. They have a nice selection of different types of beef with different cuts.Had their beef tenderloin and it was cooked perfectly.Lastly we had the blueberry souffle which was just a perfect way to end the whole meal. Service was excellent , very professional yet at the same time very friendly special thanks to Vin, Shoban , Britt and Shelley ."
Lunch with sons,"We had a very wonderful experience at the restaurant. They launch their new menu a day and we were being introduced each dish. The service by Pei San was excellent as she always cheer up the environment with her jokes and all. Autumn , Aimi and Vin are all very polite friendly and the dishes are all done well. Definitely a family environment of lunch with my wife and two sons. Thank you"
Birthday Celebration,"Food was unbelievable. We had the seafood bisque with a unique zangy citrus aftertaste to remove any seafood metallic taste. The charred octopus was juicy and the charred taste is very good. For the mains we had one of the wagyu striploin and the pork chop (recommended by our 5star server, Yatin).

We also had the fries and charred cauliflower as sides so we were too full for dessert. But there was a nice small birthday cake for me.

Overall the food was amazing and service excellent. We will definitely visit again."
