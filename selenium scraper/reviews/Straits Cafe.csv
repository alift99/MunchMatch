Delicious breakfasts for the hotel!,I'm a new vegetarian and the staff went out of their way to make my food delicious and nutritious! Thank you all!
Great Lunch!,"It has been a long time since our last visit (in 2012) and the cafe has undergone renovations and now is brighter, trendier and more cosy.

Before entering the cafe, the staff took our temperature in wake of the Covid-19 and had our contact details taken, we were then ushered to our table by the window side, which was good as we could have a good street view outside. Sofa seat was along the window that was good but was too low (not full stretch to the head) at the back, if not it would be perfect.

The food spread was good, combining of local, asian and western dishes. On the day of our visit, they had a seafood fried rice vermicelli that was very nice, besides the stewed beef, sambal fish, signature laksa that was yummy and hor fun soup too (both at live cooking station), stir fried kailan, dim sum items, seafood on the ice where prawns and crab legs were fresh and mussels, DIY rojak and salad bar etc, just to name a few. In addition, the cakes and pastry were nice and not to be missed was the durian pengyet that was so creamy and flavourful along with other like chocolate crepe, cut fruits.

And the good thing was that both hot and cold (softdrinks) beverages were inclusive in the spread, where very few restaurants would include the latter especially for lunch. Well done!

For those who fancy Japanese items maybe disappointed as there was no sushi maki or salmon though most restaurants would provide a handful of such items (for for us, it was fine), possibly because it was a Peranakan restaurant, focusing on nonya food.

Service was great, staff were friendly and efficient in clearing used plates and utensils from time to time. In particular, Tina had done a great job while the Indian manager (sorry didn't manage to get his name) was nice as we had met him before long time ago during our dinning sessions back at Oasia Hotel (Zaffron cafe) and Changi V Hotel (Saltwater cafe). It was good to see him and we had a brief chat and he was sharing with us his experiences at these cafes, that was all under the Far East Hospitality Group!

And finally, it was great value for money, considering the ambience, spread of food and service was around $55 with the 1-for-1 promotions. Lovely.

We will surely return again, surely not 8 years later, possibly for dinner and hopefully we will enjoy it as much as we did this time round.

Overall rating would be 4.5 out of 5 but since we are not able to give a 0.5, we decided to leave it at 4, giving it room for improvement and its being closed to perfection. Do keep up with the good work!"
Not worth it,Very little variety and don’t worth the price. Please reconsider your food option when you charge at that rate. Basically I stop eating after 2plate/rounds. And the familiar durian dessert was also not as nice as previously. Totally waste of my trip there.
Good Local Food Buffet,"Came here for lunch on a weekend, it's located in Hotel Rendezvous itself. Good spread of local food, especially the crayfish and the durian desserts!"
Connected to the Rendezvous,Connected to the Rendezvous Hotel and provides all their breakfast lunch and dinner options. All buffet style so if you like that kind of thing go for it as the food quality is very good. Access from the street too.
Lunch buffet is good,"We had the first team lunch in 2020 there. Not too crowded during lunch. The durian deserts and laksa are amazingly delicious, all of us can't help with more servings. The rest of the food is good too"
Great service by Marco,Waiter Marco a very cheerful and polite staff friendly and the food is really fresh & taste best recommended to this place.
Great Service,The food overall are very.Marco recommend what food is good here.Would like to have more varieties of food.Should come here again.
Amazing service from Marco,Went to Straits Cafe for dinner buffet with a group of friends. We were treated very well from the staff name Marco. Great food & great service. Try the Chili Lobster while it last.
Dinner with friends,The food is good. Marco is a very polite person. Plates were clear promptly and he also serve everyone with a smile.
Marco Great service,Had dinner as it was my birthday. Food is good. Service is excellent. Durian pengat and the crab legs is a must try.
During Christmas Visit,"On Christmas Eve 2019, we(3 of us) chose this hotel to have celebration and family gathering at Straits Cafe.

To my surprise, as LOCAL GUESTS dine in there we have to pay for car park fees.
We haven't go back to this property almost 6 years. (We hold our Wedding Banquet lunch there 6 years ago)

We spoke with Concierge staff to seek any other options to given during Festival Season and simply got rejected.

That's why I want to highlight this feedback to management team, maybe can consider offer this small and fair benefit
(To provide free car park coupon to those dine in F&B outlet guests during Festival Seasons)

I believe those guests who dine in at F&B outlets also brings great amount to hotel revenues.

The Staff at Straits Cafe are nice and professional, food was good and service was attentive.

Hope managment team can work out some options regarding car park issue if still want to stand out among competitive hotel industry in Singapore."
Christmas Lunch,Shocking Christmas lunch from our perspective. Would have expected some accompaniments with the Turkey but nope! No potatoes or anything you may expect. I suppose the blow would have been less severe had we a taste for Turkey and noodles. An experience to forget and a place I will not be going back to.
Awesome service from Marco,"Perfect venue for simple gathering with Peranakan food; laksa, kueh Pietee, Alaskan crab legs and etc."
nice hotel restaurant for Muslim travellers.,"I went to have breakfast and was impressed by wide variety of food, (which is just standard for all hotels. but no pork items, )
The fruit station- just two fruits available- Water Melon and honeydew)
The club lounge at same hotel offer wide variety of fruits - orange, grapes, even strawberry...etc.."
Christmas lunch,"We booked for our office Christmas lunch on 20 December. Disappointed with the selection of food. Expected more Christmas dishes since Christmas is around the corner but was disappointed. There were no turkey, ham or roasted beef. Asked the staff and was told these were served on alternate days. What were in place that day were fish and samosa? We do not find the food great."
Lunchtime buffet,"I came here with a friend for the lunchtime buffet in October and we made use of the Entertainer to get a 1:1 pricing. Good selection of locally themed food, quite decent quality. No problem getting a table. Don't think I'd want to pay full price though."
Food,"So-so only.nothing special,in fact,i feel like i have wasted the amount i paid for it.
But again different people has different expectations."
Good food and pleasant atmosphere,"We were in search of authentic local cuisine and found this cafe. There was a good choice on the menu but we weren’t offered the choice of the buffet. When other diners came in and were choosing from the vast array of food on the buffet we were disappointed that we hadn’t been given that option. What we had was tasty but nothing special. We were not offered anything else. Service was pretty inattentive and there is no alcohol available at this restaurant. So we didn’t stay long. It had the potential to be so much more, with all that lovely food on offer. But we felt overall that we were not being looked after or encouraged to stay and eat and enjoy."
Not worth with what we paid for,I do not recommend for Buffet in this restaurant. There are not much variety and foods are just okay. Not really worth with what we paid for.
wonderful venue,Staying in the Hotel Rendevous this venue was fantastic for all type of meals Breakfast lunch and dinner clean good variety and good value
Lacks variety,"Not much food choices. Mains were bee hoon, fried rice together laksa and prawn noodle. Highlight was sambal seafood which was so-so."
Buffet,"Service was attentive, polite and warm. Food was generally good. Particularly liked the carrot cake and hokien noodles. Hainanese chicken was good although the rice was not so fragrant."
Best local food in a hotel cafe.,Highly acclaimed laksa proven to be true! Especially love the rich coconut gravy and soft noodles topped with yummy lobsters and cockles. The starters ngoh hiang could be a main dish was also delicious. The ho fun was also very tasty and the noodles are soft.
Great food for a good price..,"We were here for dinner after a friend recommended this spot. The spread was reasonable but the flavours for each dish were rich and tasty. Definately worth coming back more dinners here. And Marco was extremely helpful in recommending the desserts, which were rich in flavour and typical of peranakan cuisine.
P.S.. the puffs and pengat were purely divine.."
Dinner with colleagues,"Its my 2nd visit here,this time with my colleagues.So glad to be greeted by Marco again.Always so helpful and smiley. So pleased with the service here as all e staffs are so friendly.Special thanks to Charles and Johari as well for the patience and food is good"
Environment and Customer service is great,Environment and Customer service is great. Will come again with my family. It will be great to have more variety of food of choices like western or indian style
Enjoyed every bit!,Food was great. Ambience was perfect. Restaurant staffs were friendly & attended to us quick & efficiently. All 10 of us had a good impression of Straits Cafe.
Great food and ambience,"Had a great time celebrating my mum's bday here, food and service was good :) highly recommended to visit."
Good spread,"Good spread, fresh seafood, good service. We had buffet lunch there and enjoyed ourselves. The laksa and prawns were very good."
"Tasty local food, nice ambience","My friends and I enjoyed ourselves. A decent spread...the beef rendang was out of this world. The teh tarik too was very good. The staff very friendly and efficient especially Marlon. Good job, Marlon."
Buffet dinner with my colleagues,All dishes have exceeded our expectation. Excellence and friendly services esp Mr Mark. Very worth the price tag. Plus they have 50% for senior citizens.
Excellent Service!,"Lunch with colleagues on 11th Oct and we had great time! The service was indeed excellent. Friendly staff and attend to our inquiries patiently. Staff name is Radha and we thought she deserve our compliment because what caught our attention about this particular staff is that, she wasnt just pleasant to us but the rest of the cusomers who were there. No sour face, all smiles. Pat on your shoulder Radha, keep it up! The Laksa in this cafe deserve 5 stars! The gravy and the taste calls for several visits! Good job chef!"
Buffet Lunch with a friend on 9 Oct 2019.,"We were at Straits Cafe after 12 noon. The vegetables were cold. The coconut in the beef rendang smelled and tasted weird. All the dishes were not as we expected. A week before, my colleagues went with a group of 5 guests. They both told me that the food quality was poor. I thought they were fussy,but now I know they were right.

We noted that your hotel staff were entertaining some guests, but they talked so loud. We could hear their conversation and it was just very noisy and rowdy with very loud music in the beginning. We just did not enjoy our lunch!!"

Pleasant and delicious,"Am most impressed with the service and friendliness of the staff. Good spread of food for the money. The clams in chillicrab sauce was superb. The fish in sambal curry gravy is another 4 star rating...and fresh prawns steamed just right. You can taste its sweetness after shelling it. There's no holding back when they prepare the laksa gravy....thick and rich. Fill in your own ingredients...fresh prawns, fish cakes, laksa leaves, shallots...etc, etc.
Durian paste for dessert and good coffee."
sha,"my 2nd visit, love2 the food! its so delicious and worth the money (15% off mastercard) will be back again"
Great food and service!,"Had a birthday celebration over dinner on Friday. Food was very good, especially the dessert! Food was constantly replenished. Service staff Ivy was very attentive to the children and the manager was very helpful. We had a great experience!"
Dinner buffet.,This is our 2nd time here and Straits Cafe was wonderful. The Laksa and Rojak is to die for. My family members love the durian pengat a lot! We will come back here again. Thank you Marco for serving our table too. You have been wonderful.
"Pleasant ambience, flavourful local dishes","Brought my mum for her birthday treat. Food was all quite delicious, notably the freshness of prawns found at the laksa station. The durian mousse was also a highlight of the meal. The only thing to watch out is the cooked fish were of mixed quality. Some pieces were fresh and some smelt fishy."
Free-flow Lobsters and Alaskan Crab Legs!,"A small spread of quite good dishes. Slightly disappointed that there were no oysters or sashimi available on Saturday night, but the lobsters and Alaskan crab legs made up for it. Durian lovers will be delighted with several varieties of durian desserts."
"Great staff, nice food",We had breakfast and dinner at this restaurant. The food was nice and the staff helpful. The menu is quite varied.
"Good food, great value, excellent service","As the name suggests, Stratis Cafe, serves mainly nonya cuisine. However, they do have some very good mediterranean dishes. I love the roast lamb, nicely done and the gravy is heavenly. The accompanying mushroom roll is also delectable. Awesome durian desserts.

One thing that really stood out was the staff. Genuine service par excellence. Special thanks also to the Assistant Restaurant Manager, Rommel for helping with my friend's broken sandal even though he doesn't have to!

Overall great dining experience. Totally recommend this restaurant for dining with friends and family."
Lunch Buffet,they have the awesome pengat durian! durian crepe! awesome ambience. awesome place to gather!! most recommended
Good Spead of Dishes,"food was good, especially the double Boiled soup, the Mee-Soto and of course the Durian Desserts. Good Deal for Senior Citizens. ."
Fantastic experience,"We had a wonderful experience. The food is great and the ambience is very relaxing. We were served by Marco, who is very friendly and he recommended many delicious food from the buffet line.

We were satisfied with the service and food. We will surely make a come back."
Nice staff and food!,"Did not expect to see lobsters on a weekday. Food is pretty good, service from Mr Marco is excellent!"
Worst buffet ever,"Was looking forward to a scrumptious buffet with local food. The variety was so little, main course variety to dessert variety is 1:1. Snow crab was too salty, horfun was so blend. Chili lobster was very average. Had one of each item and I was done, nothing spectacular. Durian desserts were not bad but the red velvet cake totally killed my taste bud. There was so much colouring that the cake tasted bitter and smells like play dough. Even the icing was stained with the colouring. Drank so many mouths of water and the bitterness still lingers. Cost was $72 per pax. How ridiculous is this. Left the buffet feeling very bitter, literally and not literally. This buffet should not exist"
Buffet Dinner,"Great place for delicious buffet! Small buffet but great choices of delicious food with a lot of Singapore’s signature food. Staffs were very polite and attentive, especially Mr. Marco and Ms Ernie. Definitely recommended and worth the value!"
Good food and service,"Food and service was good. However, restaurant do not have record of my chope booking, which is weird."
Pretty good,"A good hotel food option- nothing spectacular but a pretty decent breakfast, atmosphere and location"
Nice place for a meal with friends,"If you would like to try local dishes through a buffet format in a nice ambience somewhere downtown, then you should consider this restaurant.

Conveniently located at the end of Orchard Road, the restaurant is housed in Rendezvous Hotel. There is a MRT exit for the Downtown line that leads directly to the outside of this restaurant.

Must try dishes include laksa, chilli crayfish, nyonya rojak, and the durian pastries (especially the penyet).

Restaurant staff are helpful and friendly so that enhances the dining experience here."
Average Buffet,"Six of us attened the buffet dinner to celebrate my birthday recently. The foods were average. But I was disapoointed that no fish head curry on that day. I go there for this dish as was told its the best dish.
Parking was expensive. However, I bought the $5 parking concess ticket from restarant and I save a couple of dollar. But actually its a complimentary ticket from hotel.."
Dinner,"Celebrated my Mum's birthday here! Had a wonderful meal and the waiter, Marco, is especially helpful! We had a really good time!"
A Beautiful Day at Straits Cafe,"Chope did a great job to make reservations for us at Straits Cafe. We had a beautiful day and very relaxing at Straits Cafe. Food is good though not many dishes compared to other hotels. It is a pity Straits Cafe did not offer 1for 1 dinner. Otherwise we could frequent more often with the family.

Thank you Chope,"
"Nice Ambience, Service and Staffs","It's a pleasant experience coming to dine here with my friends. The service is amazing and the friendly staff, special mention to Radha. Thank you. She ensured that our dining experience was wonderful and she was attentive to our needs. She did it all with a smile and politeness. Kudos. Looking forward to coming here again with family."
Good food at affordable price,"Had a dinner buffet with a group of colleagues. Food is good, seafood is fresh...and the durian desert is delicious. The service staff is also very attentive, especially Marco, and the lady at the reception who helped me with the coffee machine."
Ms,Good value for food. Has senior citizens discount 50%. Net $27 for lunch. Nice cosy ambience. Good spread of food and good service. Nice place for group gathering. Must try.
"Great service, great food","We ate here every morning for breakfast. We first came due to convenience but quickly delighted in the food and staff.
We ordered ala carte every morning but one. The buffet is good but it is a lot of food with the temptation to overeat. Everything we ordered was perfect. Singapore is known for its coffee and this restaurant showed us why.
A note about the staff : the manager, Rommel, was very attentive and friendly. Radha was very sweet and helpful. Christine made our day every morning. She is a lovely person and was attentive to our needs. She is an excellent face of the Straits Cafe and a wonderful Singaporean ambassador. Thank you for making our stay so nice."
Lunch,Nice ambience. However selection of food variety was limited. The dessert section especially the cakes can be improved.
Great food and friendly staff,There were a wide variety of food to choose from. They top up the food frequently too. Friendly staff are there to assist you.
A taste of South East Asia Food,"A variety of food from South East Asia, the cooking are excellent. Environment is very convenient. Officials are very helpful"
Expectation not met,"Ambience is not ideal
Food not that great: the steam chicken (rice) is overdone; dishes such as KL noodle as advertised not served
Nonya kueh so limited: only the 9-layer kueh and the kaya glutinous rice kueh"
"Great place, Good Food","Brought my family to breakfast here. Overall, my family members gave thumbs up to the food. Tasty and good quality. Love the spread except that the area nearer to the entrance is too cramp and they were pushing and shoving to get food. That place need to look into. Food replenishment need to be prompt when it finished.

The staff were courteous and friendly. Top notch service"
Good Ramadan buffet,A decent Ramadan buffet. The steam seabass was excellent. However didn't like the Malay assam laksa as it was too salty The durian desert was good and choice of other cakes were good
Marco is the best,We were very fortunate to be serviced by Marco. Excellent service and great advise on the food. Will definitely come back.
Good smiley service and prompt,Staff cleared used plate fast. Staffs are attentive to patrons needs. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Buffet spread is not as huge as other 5* restaurants but it is worth the money and all food are tasty. Much recommended.
Iftar cum birthday celebration,Good ambience. Good and nice spread of food. Good service by Marco. He was very pleasant and friendly. Did a nice birthday surprise for my mother.
Great good and warm service,"Very pleasant experience overall. Buffet spread is very decent. The highlight is still the durian desserts. Another underrated item is the tea tarik here. The tea tarik is unlike others, as it is self-made by them. Marco has been great and my girl friend was impressed with his recommendation for the tea tarik, and with him serving her a cup.

Will definitely recommend the buffet here."
Great place for gathering,"Nice and cosy place for gathering. Widespread of buffet varieties; Seafood were fresh, laksa was food; Staff helpful and nice. Worth visiting."
Straits cafe review,"The lobster is not fresh, same goes for the fish head curry.
The price is not worth paying for the overall spread.
And the cups are all stained."
A convenient restaurant with wonderful staff,Wonderful breakfast buffet. The place is spacious and quiet. The morning breakfast arrangements for the Rendezvous Hotel are there.
Excellent service!,"Would like to send a great thanks and appreciation to the manager and staffs for agreeing and assisting to our request of combining two stretches of tables together so that we could sit and interact with every single one.

There was a great variety of food available. And the snow crabs were super fresh and juicy! On the whole, thank you for making our gathering a great one!"
Excellent food & Service,Excellent service fronm Marco & Marlon (waiters on duty on 14.4.19). Food is delicious especially the durian custard.
One of the best,This is my second time I had dinner here. The first was 5years ago. And I enjoyed it. Love the menu they provided. Ambience is nice too.
Lunch gathering,Good and attentive service. Nice and tasty food too. Kudos to Marco for his good service. Will definitely recommend to friends and family
Good buffet,Quality food but limited selection. Our waiter Marco is very pleasant. He is quick to clear our table and even took the time to ask whether the food is agreeable and how is our experience. Pleasant dining environment.
Review of food and services - Lunch Buffet Sat.,"Excellent services, quality food, fresh prawns, crabs and flayfish. Price is reasonable for a hotel standard.Good to always check for any promotion before heading down to book."
Worst breakfast at a hotel.,"- meat options is scarce.
Whichever other meat they have are in the form of sausages,ham,bacon ,anchovies and otak otak. Thats all.

- nasi lemak ( coconut rice ) is served with Plain rice.

- a travesty in the name of dhal. Bland and kinda disgusting actually.

Bread and fruits were decent."
"Decent food, good service","Went with a couple of ex colleagues and enjoyed the food. Though the variety is pretty limited, I was expecting more for the price but it was food quality wise was still decent. I would suggest to have more live station and variety. Desserts was good too."
Lunch on 21 March,Great service by Marco. Great that they have the 50% for senior citizens. My dad doesn’t eat that much so this is just nice for him.
Good food and service,Both service and food is good. Staff Marco was kind very friendly in serving us throughout our meal.
buffet dinner,this restaurant can rival princess terrace cafe in food quality. the food selection is decent and service prompt. love their sambal stir fried station on weekends and their double boiled soup.
Good service and buffet spread,Second time at the Straits Cafe and still find the spread to be reasonable for the buffet promotions available. The laksa is good and the durian desserts are tasty. The service and attention from Marco and his team is impeccable. Will come back again.
Dinner for Mother’s Birthday,"We had dinner at Straits Cafe for the second time. The food was excellent especially the sambal seafood, teh tarik and laksa. Your staff Marco was also very attentive. He even stopped to ask how everything was and how he could assist us. Would definitely come back again."
Food is value,"The food here is generally very good. Love the Lok Lok, the dipping sauce pairs very well with the sticks of food.

The Chili paste sambal fried ladies finger and sotong is very nice too.

Used it together with HSBC 1 for 1 offer it is of value.

Marco is the waiter who serves at our table. Very impeccable and prompt service. Thank you very much Marco."
Business Meeting at Straights Cafe,My meeting was very successful and have to thank the cafe for its excellent food and atmosphere. The selection on durian is just phenomenal.
Excellent service and food quality,"The food quality was top notch especially the snow crabs! Although the variety is not alot, they had a unique assortment of international food. Would like to commend Marco for serving us and introducing their Teh Tarik to end our scrumptious dinner!"
Not worth it,"They offer small variety of seafood. Clams and clams aren’t look fresh. They have good amount of prawns but sadly they dont have the most important - the soy sauce (shoyu) instead they have all the typical spicy sauce (traditional nonya). There’s no much options for $54 buffet. Cooked food where a bit bland to my liking.

Service are really good though...the reception are quite helpful and accomodating."
Amazing,There's an employee who works here named Marco that has made my experience really nice! Would definitely come back here again. Food is really tasty and very authentic to Singaporean food. Love it! Definitely recommend. Love the prawn noodles :)
Good buffet,"Good place nice ambience for the family, laksa was delicious. Service was good, especially staff ‘Marco’! Went the extra mile and helped out my grandparents. Would recommend!"
Great service and food,"Excellent service. The laksa is a must try. For dessert, I like the durian collection. The ambience is cosy."
Birthday Dinner for Family,Good food with great service. Special shoutout Marco for his great service and extra attentiveness!!
Great lunch experience,"1st time here for lunch and love it. Food is great and the ambience is nice. Staff were friendly and helpful, and were willing to help in anyway, especially Marco who always checked to see if we were okay. Overall, great experience. Will be looking forward to come again. :)"
Excellent service,1st time here with friends and family.Pleasantly surprised by the comfortable setting and relaxing ambience.The service was really good too esp Marco!Well done!
Very good food n excellent service. Price 50% off for senior citizen for both lunch n dinner. Very worth 3,"Very good service n friendly staff, food fresh n tasty with good varieties n price is 50% off for Senior citizen for both lunch n dinner frm Sunday to Thur. Worth visiting place.3 adult spend less than $100. 🤗🤗🤗"
Nice place and good food,Straits cafe is a place for a good food for moderate money and the choices are wow. The host makes you feel welcomed.
Weekend Buffet Lunch,The foods are great although the variety is limited. Great for durian lovers. Staffs were smiley. Seafood section can be improved!
Great Dinner!,Great food and ambience. The spread isn’t big but its enough. Family loved it. Nice warm staff all around as well. We were attended by Marco most of the time who was being attentive to our needs. Will return when there is a change of menu in future.
Great food and excellent service,"My family and I were there for the dinner buffet to celebrate my mum's birthday. We have enjoyed the food and service.

Noteworthy sambal stirred fried petais (chou dou) and samabal seafood. I have tried a few halal international buffets and I am ranking Straits Cafe on the top of my list.

I would like compliment Marco, a service staff at the Straits Cafe. He has taken an extra mile to take care of my grandmother's well being. He offered a jacket when she was cold and too initiatives to assist her.
Thank you Marco for making a wonderful night for me and my family. :) Keep it up!"
