Quality food!,"Quality food. Prices are on the expensive side but considering the location that is okay. All the veggies looked very fresh, service was great."
Excellent service but average food,"Went with high expectation but the food failed to meet that expectation. Only falafel was good and rest of the food items were pretty average but the price is reasonable. Young man who was manning the counter, taking the order and serving the customers was exceptional. He was very pleasant, humble and polite who kept the place running. I would go again just for his service and excellent approach in managing so many customers single handedly."
Would not recommend the place,"We ordered 3 dishes and all of them scored very low in terms of taste, quality, presentation and authenticity. What made things worst is the attitude of the owner who did not care when we talked to him about it. NOT the place to go."
one of my new favorite places in SG now! wonderful first time experience!,"I was joining my friends that night and I glad that I came!
It was a half empty place at the beginning and got full in a while! believe me its tricky to fine seats nowadays. I met a lot of friends over there as well! Everybody came for food!

We tried a a lot of veg dishes and a few bottles of wine! Well< frankly speaking I was trying all the cocktails menu !

Food was delicious. We like the wine too.

cocktails, well, i like the spicy old fashion! Still something to improve over there but again -we came for food.

service. They were extremely helpful with a smile on! but I dont remember them talking at all . But its okay - result was pleasant! Just last thing to mention - slow down at fast clearing tables! Especially If you dont ask first!

other then that - carry on the great Job!"
Middle Eastern Eats,"It took me awhile to locate this eatery amongst the many along Nankin Row but I was glad I found it. Only outdoors tables are available and food and drinks menus are found after scanning a QR code placed on the tables.

The cuisine is Middle Eastern, so expect items such as Falafel, Pitas and Hummus. I started my meal with the Hummus and Pita Bread (4 pieces of bread and a generous portion of Hummus) whilst waiting for my dinner companion. The Hummus is absolutely fragrant and tasty and made for a great appetiser. For mains, I chose the Koshari (Egypt’s national dish and a widely popular street food consisting of rice, lentils, macaroni, tomato sauce, etc.), served in a large bowl. Once again, I cannot fault the taste, but it could be a little spicy for some.

Service was prompt and fuss-free, and I would return again."

Decent pita and nice spicy falafel,We shared the 3 person shared meal along with mashed potatoes. The falafel is spicy and nice and while the mashed potatoes were thick and tasty. Would definitely come back
Delicious vegetarian food,"Perfectly cooked and full of flavor, it was delicious. We shared everything for a very fair price. Plus the staff is attentive and caring. Will come back for sure."
"Normal food, little bit ovepriced","I was a little bit disappointed, when came to place - so many perfect reviews , but food just normal , nothing special, portion so small and price so high not enough vegetables in pitta"
Vegetarian Middle Eastern Restaurant,This might be the only Vegetarian Middle Eastern Restaurant we have been to but we're not disappointed. The food is amazing its a new take on Traditional middle eastern food. The food is light yet fullfilling even my kids loved it. If you want to enjoy something different definitely try this place it's a healthier alternative.
Overpriced,"I went to Fill a Pita with a couple of friends for lunch. I had a single platter which contains 5 small dishes such as hummus, falafel, pita bread, beans and garlic sauce. The guys were clearly not ready for our orders as they served only 3 of these dishes (not because they were busy as the restaurant was empty). We had to wait for the other half of the platter for about 20 minutes. The staff seemed to be totally OK with it. The flavours were good but I left the place hungry and I think it was very overpriced. I can get a nice main course in a restaurant for the price I paid there. We are not going back."
.,"Loved the place, the food is delicious, the service is quick and the staff are very friendly. Thouroughly recommend."
"Amazing food, try Koshari and Falafel","Simply magnificent First time I try the Koshari, what a dish! I recommend having it spicy The falafel was very tasty and distinguished too Highly recommended"
Falafel Pita was delicious,The Falafel Pita was really delicious. The texture was crunchy and the pita was nice and hot. The chilli sauce is a must if you like spicy food.
Amazing!!,"Great food & service - thank you so much!! The lentil soup, falafel and bread are amazing, one of the best lunch spots in the CBD definitely check this out"
Best Hummus & Pita in Singapore,I wasn’t really hungry but wanted a snack when I was in between meetings. I had the hummus and pita bread and it was so delicious. I will be back for sure.
Delicious food!,The food was so delicious. I loved their falafels and Labna cheese mixed pita. There was a very interesting balance of flavors.
Best labna in town,Fill a pita is one of my favoite restaurants in Singapore. The food is tasty and light and the staff are super friendly!
Amazing Middle Eastern food!,Decided to step outside my comfort zone and try something new for lunch and was extremely pleasantly surprised! The falafel I had was amazing! The staff are very helpful and I'm a huge fan of the hummus. Found a my new fave spot!
Vegan friendly!,I loved my meal at Fill a Pita. Had great vegan options and fresh pita bread. I loved their twist on some of the dishes! Definitely recommend
Really enjoyed the falafel pita and coriander hummus side,I had lunch at fill a pita today and the food was great. I had the falafel pita and coriander hummus side!
The best falafels in Singapore,This place is a little gem. With a new owner who treats you like family from the moment you arrive to what can only be described as the best falafels in Singapore!
Quick and healthy lunch in the CBD,What a wonderful spot! Great if you are in a rush with quick and healthing food. I would recommend the Falafels!
Singapore’s best Middle Eastern food!,The freshest and healthiest Middle Eastern food around! I loved the Labna cheese and Garlic hummus. The perfect spot for a casual lunch in the CBD.
Koshari bowl was so good!,My Girlfriend and I had the Koshari bowl and it was absolutely delicious. The spicy option was the best part of it. We also really enjoyed the falafels and hummus sides.
Loved the Koshari bowl!,My boyfriend and I went for the koshari bowl and asked for it spicy. It was super delicious. It was the first time for us to try it and we loved it! We also ordered a side of falafel and hummus with pita which were so delicious too!
"Falafels, Garlic Hummus, and Pita Bread were zesty!",The falafel was mouthwatering. I could have it everyday. The garlic hummus had a smooth texture and was easy on the mouth. The pita bread was nice and hot and tasted fresh.
Falafels falafels falafels,"I stopped by fill a pita last Friday and I ordered a single platter. The hummus, fava, and Labna were pretty good but the falafels got the most attention. I noticed them baking the falafels instead of frying them. I never had falafels baked before and I really enjoyed every bite."
Falafel and Labna cheese,The customer service was the first impressive part of fill a pita. They were very welcoming and the food matched the service. The falafel and Labna cheese were really tasty.
The hummus was delicious!!!,I had a meeting in the area and decided to check the place out. I ordered the eggplant sandwich. Never had that before and it tasted really good. Had a coriander hummus on the side which I really enjoyed the most.
Love their falafels!,I ordered the 2 pax platter with my colleague and we really enjoyed the variety they had on the platter. The falafels were the best part.
Best falafel in Singapore,I loved the falafels sooo much. I’ve never had falafels baked before. I asked the staff why the taste was different and they mentioned that they baked it because it was healthier.
Love the Koshari!,"I visited there with some friends from work and it was perfect! The Koshari bowl was ideal, a little piece of Egypt I must say. It was great to have a place that gives off a little taste of home.
The falafels and Labna cheese are a must try too."
Best Falafels in town,The falafels were baked fresh and so tasty. You can taste the fresh herbs and their pita bread is out of this world.
Excellent variety,The place has an excellent variety of dishes and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Very economical too.
Koshari was absolutely delicious,Tried the Koshari bowl and it was so good. I added a side of Labna cheese inside and it blended in so well! Glad to have discovered my new favourite joint!
My Wife and I were at Fill A Pita yesterday for lunch and I have to say the hummus was so delicious. We try the 2 pax pl,My Wife and I were at Fill A Pita yesterday for lunch and I have to say the hummus was so delicious. We try the 2 pax platter which had 4 sides and comes with a pita bread. Highly recommended. Best Hummus in Town
A taste of Egypt,"i gotta admit as an Egyptian & a serious lover of Koshary, this place is exceptional. the pita bread (had the falafel) is delicious as well as the houmous. a highly recommended place to eat.. and the portions are great!"
Best falafels in town,I’ve just had lunch at fill a pita and was so contented with their falafels. I ordered a single platter which came with 4 sides and a pita bread and will definitely be back again.
Nice lunch place,"Hi, visited this place with my Wife for a lunch last week. Being vegetarian, we quite liked their extensive vegan menu. The falafel and other dish was nice. The staff was also very courteous. Highly recommended."
Good food and cheap,"Went here for a quick lunch on way back to Raffles Place from Chinatown. Unfortunately they were out of falafels! However we had the mixed platter, which provided four fillers for the pita bread. With the house lemonade, this was an excellent lunch."
Closed until January 7th 2019!!!!,"Unfortunately this place was not open. I checked the website before going and did not see any info about their vacation. Not a big deal, but I missed out on great other options on the way. Especially if you are looking for vegan options.
So, don't go before January 7th 2019!!"
Excellent food,Its one of the best authentic Mediterranean food. Falafels and hummus are absolute must here. Both Uncle and aunty provide great customer experience and help you in selecting the right food choice.
Healthy Fill-a-Pita doesn’t fill you up,"Best are the falafels, made with broadbeans instead of the usual chickpeas, although they are a bit pricey at $2.50 for a tiny piece. Friendly place with the Egyptian owner running the show himself. Hope the economics work out for them, as this location has high rents and they have lots of staff."
"Delicious Koshari and brilliantly unique Falafel, also excellent eggplant dip.","Hassan is always friendly and provides excellent customer service when we (fully vegan Singaporean lady and tall Brit man) come eat at his lovely restaurant. He happily ensures that everything we order will be vegan since he knows every ingredient in his sumptuous food. This quality is so important but sadly very rare in most of the F&B places in Singapore.

In general, this food is brilliantly fresh in tastes and flavour. The spices in the Koshari are out of this world as is the combination of ingredients.

We absolutely love the amount of fresh herbs in his Falafel mixed in with the broad beans which are just sheer genius. Being very health conscious too, it's so refreshing to have them baked rather then fried. The texture is still so nice and crisp and the vegetables in the falafel pitas are lovely.

I am no fan of the humble eggplant and dislike its rather squishy texture; however, in Hassan's hands, I actually love the taste of eggplant in his dip in the generous happy hour platter. His pitas are also very nice, neither too dense nor do they simply fall apart.

We can't wait to go back."
Koshari at Fill a Pita,"I just had a great vegetarian Koshari here, wonderful flavour, nice spices and a generous portion. It is very nice to have a vegetarian/vegan Egyptian restaurant in SGP!"
"Not a vegetarian, but enjoyed the pita meal","I went here not realizing it was vegetarian but decided to order something random just to try it. I got a pita with falafel and a type of cheese (can't remember what it was called). The pita itself actually comes with a sauce, cucumbers and tomatoes as well and since it was to go, the pita was stuffed and wrapped. I ate mine about 25 minutes after I purchased it, so it was only a little warm but was still great to eat.

The pita had some good flavour and I really liked the falafel, which I had never had before. The pita itself was too much for me to eat over lunch, so the portion was well worth the price of 15 SGD (Mix Pita + Soda)."
Authentic vegetarian arab food,This is the place to go if you are vegetarian and want to taste authentic arab food. In fact this is a good place for anyone who loves arab food.
Not good,"We ordered two Falafel pita and a side of Hummus and eggplant.

The sandwiches were not good they were not actually Falafel they were something else which is not good either. I expected to have a good sandwich as i found such a high review but it did not meet any of my expectations as falafel which is something am familiar with as am a middle-eastern tourist.

The Hummus and eggplant were okey thats why i added a star."
Not great,"Wanted to find a good falafel And I found this for its good rating. Honestly. I didn’t find this authentic taste wise. The falafel was dry and too much hot sauce was addded. The tabuleh salad wasn’t up to mark either. When u order pita on side, All other places would already give u two pita breads here only 1!!!! I am gonna find a better option for middle eastern soon."
Fill a pita,Very good place and very friendly staff!we were exhausted with our Singapore visit and we found these nice place to enjoy a very delicious pita and hummus.
One of the nicest places to eat at in sg!!,"We've been coming here for 2 years now and the food has always been so delicious and fresh and affordable and healthy!! :) we love the pita bread with hummus, halloumi mix, koshari rice and moussaka!! A must try!! :) plus the boss and his wife are always so friendly and welcoming!"
Very fresh and delicious,"Love the fresh tastey and healthy food! Falafels made to order!!!! The Hummus was so good, cost was affordable and a nice outdoor seating area : )"
Great Middle Eastern Food!,"Friendly and prompt service, nice al fresco ambience! Nice for a casual and quiet weekend lunch. Highly recommended for those seeking authenic yet affordable middle eastern food!"
Best Egyptian Food in town!,"Great place for hummus, falafel, babaganoush in Singapore. We have been here multiple times and always the food is very fresh. Been eating here since 2+ years and never disappoints👍🏻"
ok veg fare,"Read the TA reviews and visited Fill a pita. Unfortunately we found the food just ok. the drinks were much more tasty though, we tried the tamarind and hibiscus. re: food, on the day we visited the falafels were hard, like they had been reheated at a high temp in the microwave. Hummus was also quite pungent for us. so all in all was average food and good drinks. assume food is better when the lunch hour crowd dies down. Staff were prompt and friendly. Food is not too costly"
"Great food, great price, great hosts","My wife is vegetarian so this came up on her Google search. It was 2 blocks from our hotel in China town so we tried out the lunch. We each got the platter and were not disappointed. The price was $13 which is cheap for Singapore and the food was fresh and very delicious. Mamdouh came over and asked how the food was and we started up a nice conversation about Macau, the city we're living in. If you like friendly people and good food don't miss this place."
Over priced food with just ok taste,"Visited this for the third time as I was super happy with my previous visits. Unfortunately this time they disappointed me both in pricing and food quality.

Ordered Koshari rice ($10 )and mixed platter for 2($30).

Koshari rice was very bad and tasted like store bought tomato sauce. I can surely say it was not like this earlier.

Platter for 2 too is just ok. Had falafel, yogurt salad,favs beans , hummus and Pita in the platter. For the quantity they serve It’s pricey ($30)I can say.

Overall a very disappointing experience unlike a few years ago."
Light lunch,"Quick, light, fresh, vegetarian, healthy, friendly service are the words I’ll use to describe this place."
Lunch favy!,Loved the lunch here during office hours.we ordered the platte for 3and its was perfect.The falafels were hot pita bread was soft and garlic hummes was finger licking. Will come here again.
Great place to have lunch!,"Very friendly place with delicous food. Freshly prepared pitas with among others zucchini, eggplant and hummus. Recommended!"
A pearl of the orient right at the heart of Singapore,"I visited fill a Pita on a Saturday morning and ordered the 2 person Falafel platter. The whole experience was out of this world! You are first greeted by the gentle smile and polite tone of one of the hosts. I'm using the word ""host"" because through out our meal we felt that we are appreciated guests having our breakfast at the middle eastern generous house. If you throw your sight behind the counter you'd notice a kind lady manning the kitchen with the same care she'd put in preparing meals for her family at home. A true home cooking experience. Saturday was calm to the extent that the food was served at our table before we finished paying our bill. (As I came to understand from the host it's almost a full house at lunch hour on weekdays). As for the food, three words pretty much sums it up; Tasty, Healthy and high quality (okay 4!) the best ingredients are finely picked and almost everything is cooked with the finest olive oil. Dishes are not deep fried but carefully prepared in the oven to produce the healthiest possible combination out of these dishes. My eyes almost popped out checking the Mosakka and Koshary plates that other people ordered. I'm definitely going back to try each one of these delicacies."
Delicious food,"Tasty, satisfying food that leaves you feeling healthier after eating it. One of my favourite places for lunch in the cbd. Particularly amazing labne."
Simply the best Egyptian food in SIngapore,"We have bee loyal visitors of Fill a Pita since 3+ years...and not just the ambience and location has changed for the better, the quality of food has simply magnified multiple times! Be it the coriander hummus, garlic hummus, falafel, halloumi, fava beans or labna cheese, taboulleh salad or the pita bread itself. Simply amazing taste. Our favourite place for lunch and we visit at least once a week. Do not miss their recent offering Pisaara, a mouth watering Egyptian dish hand made by Mr. Mamdu (the owner’s) wife. A true delight and a must visit if you love Mediterranean or Egyptian cuisine!!! Great hospitality and excellent food makes this place a winner!"
Best Mediterranean food in SG,The most authentic middle eastern food. Purely vegetarian and so many options Must try the platter they have Cheers
Regular Mediterranean Fix,"I’ve been regularly going to Fill-A-Pita for over a year. It’s definitely my favourite place to go to for delicious and healthy Mediterranean food. Owned by an Egyptian man and a lovely Singaporean lady, the food is always prepared fresh with love. I usually grab the Falafel Pita and Hummus, and I haven’t found another place in SG that does it so well. It’s also vegetarian and vegan friendly. I’d recommend that people visit out of the office lunch time hours. Located on the cusp of the CBD, it gets quite crowded during lunch time (for good reason) and expect long wait times because the food is prepared fresh. It’s a small establishment so getting a table during lunchtime can be tough too. I’d recommend swinging by after 2pm for those who want a quiet lunch."
Very slow service,Food is so so but just not sure it’s worth the wait. Nice people but service real slow. Don’t go out of your way to eat there. If waking by and hungry than sure try it
Authentic Middle Eastern vegetarian food with vegan options,"It is a small place that mainly operates on weekdays - relying on the office crowd at lunchtime, but the food is simple yet delicious. Many of the dishes are vegan, I highly recommend the pita bread with hummus and falafels."
Tastes like microwaved Koshari with stale tomato sauce.,It seems like the quality of food has gone down from the last time I visited this place in Shenton Way. Macaroni used for Koshari is not fresh and with stale tomato sauce on top.
Must tey,Excellent food. Great service. Reasonable price. Definitely worth a visit if you’re in Singapore! Great selection/choice. We enjoyed the platter for 2. Would recommend.
Rude Egyptian Owner of this restaurant,"Terrible owner! Everything else is nice but the whole experience of eating here was bad as the owner of this restaurant is rude. Usually there is a lady at the cash counter and she is nice. But if you see this old man who is the owner of this place, he is rude to his customers. They overcharge 1 dollar for credit card payments and if you ask them why politely, owner will simply shout or be rude to you instead of explaining politely. Never going to this place again!"
"Good Service, food has room for improvement","I love Mediterranean food and tried out fill-a-pita for lunch with family. The staff is very nice and courteous and we were attended to promptly.

The food though was a hit and miss. The hummus was excellent, one of the best i have had. The multi-grain pita was warm, but it did not seem freshly made. We also had koshari rice/pasta/lentil bowl, eggplant pita sandwich and mushroom vegetables lasagna. Eggplant sandwich filling was very refreshing and good, however again a bit of letdown was the pre-made (or packaged) pita. Lasagna and the koshari were average, and i would have given them full points if only the sauce was made from fresh ingredients. While the rice , pasta , mushroom etc. seemed freshly cooked, the sauce originating from canned tomatoes was clear...and when i went back to get some serviettes i noticed the pomodoro tomato cans in the background. While pomodoro is a good choice for making red sauce, unfortunately it doesnt work so well from canned version.

We also tried the chilled lemonade which being pre-made was also lacking the freshness and zest you feel from a freshly made lemonade.

I think being a quick in-and-out style of food place and to keep the price affordable, they have to make some short-cuts like the canned tomatoes and pre-made pita etc. but that takes away from the food being excellent.

Don't expect to be wowed, but a decent vegetarian Mediterranean option."
Healthy n happy meals,"I have been regular customer of Fill A Pita for last couple of years. This is one of the top favourite place for me to have lunch.

Food options here are quite healthy and staff is very friendly.

I am grateful for their hospitality and special attention I get for my dietary needs.

I keep bringing my friends and family here for happy meals."
Tasty vegetarian lunch,"This was our second visit in 3 days, it did not disappoint. The babaganoush, hummus and labna cheese served with warm pitta were lovely. The owner insisted we try the house special fava beans too (complimentary). All in we had a tasty lunch for two for SG$14."
Good Vegetarian Option,"I visited this place for the first time and the food is pretty decent. There is good variety available to choose from so you can possibly do multiple visit to try everything in the menu. If you would like your food to be spicy please request for it as the standard serving is not spicy enough.

Overall a good option and would visit one more time to see if there is consistency."
Great vegetarian option!,Love the food.Healthy baked falafels with fresh whole meal pita bread. Dips are great too. Warm and friendly owner. Great option for vegetarians in the business district.
Delicious!,"A friend recommended this place and it was well worth it! Delicious, home-made, fresh ingredients. Nice atmosphere and friendly owners. Vegetarian halal Middle Eastern cuisine. Recommend going on a Saturday afternoon for a chill environment."
From Great to just about Average,"This was was a super place to eat before - the old owner had good character and gave this place a buzz. Now it's become a regular commercial restaurant - average service and scrimping on fillings. I ordered a Falafel Pita with chili and yogurt - but had to ask for garlic yogurt twice as they only give you like 10ml at time. I remember the days when Hassan used to just come and give the bottle to use. Hummus also served without a spoon. They also removed the free water tank.
Its a shame as it was a great place to eat...."
Excellent Healthy Lunch Choice,I am a regular visitor and find the menu has an excellent selection of healthy lunch choices. The owners are very friendly and add to the great overall ambiance. I often have the mixed falafel and fava bean pita or the Koshari. I will continue to enjoy my lunch experiences at Fill a Pita.
Not recommended,Disappointing salad portion. Their falafel taste very different to authentic middle eastern one and is not at all to my taste. Wouldn't go back.
Fantastic food,Lovely ambience and great food. We had a platter which was good enough for 2 of us. Hibiscus drink is definitely recommend.
Fresh and authentic middle eastern vegetarian food,"Was there last Friday. The pita served was hot and fresh that you could eat it on its own. The falafel was just fabulous. As i was there during non-peak, I had a chance to speak with the owner, Mamdouh. He is an Egyptian and I could tell he is extremely passionate about his food and in delighting his customers. Try also the Tamarind drink..its refreshing and I doubt you can find it anywhere else. Definitely a place to go if you are looking for Mid East Vegetarian food."
Disappointing,"Was super excited to try this place out but genuinely disappointed by their falafel and Taboulleh salad.
First, the falafel itself tastes nothing like original middle eastern falafel. Second,
the Taboulleh portion for $4 was just ridiculous. It was a sauce size serving...
Furthermore, I got sick from the food.
I would not recommend this place at all."
Quick lunch,Such lovely service for the sweet lady at the counter. Would definitely come past again. Big bonus for me is that the menu indicates which items have no garlic and no onion - ideal if you need a fructose friendly option
Authentic food and lovely staff!,"The staff here is genuinely so kind and helpful. While I was eating my food and being my normal messy self, the woman working the cashier grabbed a handful of napkins and came over to give them to me with a smile. No worker has ever done something like that for me unprompted, it was very sweet of her. I had the fava bean pita, which was super delicious and tasted fresh. Service was very quick and you can sample the ingredients if you'd like, such as the fava beans. This restaurant has great vegan options and even labels which menu items are vegan."
Real vigertian food,"I have been told by my friends to give a visit to this place to taste their foods
So i decide to choose a sample from everything started wirh the sides
Hommus was excellent and Labnah then to Falafel was hot and fresh then ended up with their Koshari brown rice and their new drink Tamar Ind, i never taste it before
It was fantastic.

Really the food was fresh and healthy plus the hospitality was given to me was excellent

I wish to thank the whole team for their services."
Most delicious pitas & lovely staff,"I have been at this awesome place a few times for lunch and also brought my visitors as fresh pitas, soups & hummus are absolutely beautiful (haven't tried everything from the menu yet but will return for sure very soon to do so).
Amazing, authentic taste, fresh and healthy ingredients, wonderful sauces and most importantly: It's made with love by a fantastic staff and attentive & passionate owner. Perfect for everyone who like it healthy, balanced, flavourful & oriental - real soul food!"
Come if you want top quality food and first class services,"This is the place for top quality food and first class services. Selling pita, salads koshari brown rice and lenthil soup. A must visit when you are around the area."
Inedible pitas...not Mediterranean or Middle Eastern,"If you come here for the falafel pita you have to 100% tell them no chili unless you want South-east Asian level of spiciness x 100. This place advertises itself as Mediterranean and Middle Eastern, but ask yourself what Mediterranean or Middle Eastern pita has ever -DRENCHED- its pita with chili sauce. And I mean drenched. Look at their main picture at the top with a pita, it's red because it's ALL chili. Absolutely inedible unless you've got taste buds made of wood.

And don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about it being ""too spicy"" for my tastes (I like spicy food!). I'm talking the pita was drenched in chili sauce to the point where the food is inedible."
"filling portions, but","Food was affordable. Chilli sauce in the falafel pita was spicy, tangy and weird. Look for their specials on a board, which we missed. And an option of a pita pocket would be welcome. We could not finished the whole pita. It was messy to eat too with sauce leaking out. Lady at counter could explain and help us with choices."
Best falafel at MBS,We had best falafel in Singapore at this place. It's organic and vegetarian. Walk on MBS before and after is unforgettable.
Had a great birthday celebration,"Called to check if we could reserve a table for 6 to celebrate a birthday on a busy Friday afternoon. When they heard it was a birthday, they gave us free drinks and cutlery for the cake. The food was fantastic and it was a lovely long lunch. Highly recommend the place."
LOVELY! ❤,"It is the last day of my Singapore trip and I am so glad I found this place. 'Save the best for last'. The staff is so friendly! The lady behind the counter was so sweet and helpful. I could' really decide what to take because I saw so many nice things on the menu. She helped me pick a few things so that I could try a little bit of everything. There was no babaganoush today, but they did have a new dish with eggplant on the menu that I could try. I had pita, hummus, favabeans, falafel and that new eggplant dish. And homemade lemonade! Everything was really delicious!
Loved the personal service. The owner (I think?) also came to my table to ask how I liked the food.
I can't wait to be back in Singapore and visit this place again.

I never had the urge to write a review on TripAdvisor, but for this restaurant I just had to!"
Best Food,In spite of I'm coming from Egypt whereby you can get best Koshary or Falafel but the food in FaP was tasty and the friendly atmosphere offered by staff was exceptional It's not easy to get all of this with low cost under one roof.
Delicious sharing platter for two,Staff were very friendly and explained what the names of the dishes meant. The sharing platter does not look much but was a huge portion enough for three ladies.
Great customer service,Customer service was second to none. We had the falafel pitta and hoummus which was lovely and incredibly filling. The staff then came over and asked us if we needed directions to the next place we were going to which was a nice touch. Well worth a visit!
Overpriced and Lacks in Taste,"I have no idea what this place is rated so high. It's has overpriced tasteless food.
I am not sure the cook even knows how to make falafel which is a staple in Mediterranean food."
Completely top-class,"Greeted with very friendly warmth and attention by the owner and staff, served piping hot and really delicious pita and falafel, with all the trimmings you could possibly wish for, cheeses, sauces, and even extra, steaming hot pita when the owner saw we had gobbled everything up. Such love poured into cooking their very own food and serving it with joy is rare indeed. I am thoroughly impressed; the people and the food made my day, thank you so much."
Brilliant Business Bites,"Went the extra mile of going back with cash, payWave isn't on yet. The owner hoped for my sake it was worth it & I can categorically say it was in all aspects of engaging service, quality fare, washed down with homemade lemonade. Don't miss this lunch experience when in the city."
Great food but don't have all options every day,"I went here a couple of times - the food was really nice (vegan options on the menu), however some options are not available on all days so be wary if you're going there for a specific dish. When I went one time there were no pita available (!)."
