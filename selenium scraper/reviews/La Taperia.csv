Good food and service,Food was tasty and although portions can be more generous. Service was very attentive and plates were cleared and replaced regularly
Excellent Food & Service,Enjoyed the food and excellent service. Nice atmosphere. Will definitely come back again.Food was delicious.
Poor,The food used to be really good but the quality and taste is no longer the same sadly. The flavour of the gaspacho with burrata was not balanced. The pulpos was very chewy. It used to be lovely and was my favourite dish.
Too noisy,We had lunch there Dc 29. Many tables occupied. It was too noisy. You should soundproof the ceiling or use some things to absorb sound.
Thursday Afternoon,Service was excellent. We got the set lunch menu which was a 3 course menu. You get nice chunks of mushroom in their mushroom soup. Octopus leg is fresh. Overall appetizers wow. Mains & dessert good.
Great Ambiance but food can be better,"Nice setting, great ambiance but both the chorizo y pollo and Paella Negara de marisco can be better. Their warm tapas was delicious tho - Huevos Estrellados.., Chipirones Fritos.., & churros. Churros was amazing"
One of the best restaurants in Singapore period,"Ordered 4 tapas and 2 small paellas and every dish was splendid. Some dishes had really amazing value-for-money, particularly the lamb ribs, the crispy baby squid, and of course the paella: all delicious. Staff is always friendly, atmosphere is nice, perfect for pretty much literally any occasion you want to have a celebration that isn't overly extravagant. Good location too. Definitely a restaurant I will come back to."
Nice ambience and great food,The clams are marvelous as well as the crystal bread. Indeed it was a good dinner for Xmas dinner. I heard about this restaurant so I went to experience it myself. I must say that I am not disappointed at all.
"Decent food overall, beef steak is lovely","For starters we had the croquetas and beef cepachio. For mains We shared the seafood paella, chicken paella and beef steak. The standout was the beef steak."
Good tapas,"We had the Cheese croquettes, prawn Gambas, Venus clams, baby squid, suckling pig, squid ink paella. We also had a bottle of Pinot Noir wine. Food was excellent except that we found the suckling pig quite fatty under the crisp skin. Cost came to $314 for 4 pax."
"Good food, casual atmosphere",Good quality is good. Tapas serving size is generous and enough for 2-3 pax sharing so do take note if you intend to try a lot of variety. Good wine selection.
Always Enjoyed Great Spanish Food here,"Late dinner for 2, so we shared starters - charcoal grilled lamb rib and pan-fried duck liver with caramelized green apple onion chutney. Also shared one main dish - squid ink seafood paella regular size. Total cost plus a bottle of wine is S$217"
Good experience,"We had the set meal and the appetisers and desserts were delicious. However my main course of lamb was slightly fatty and chewy. My companion had the ocean trout and he enjoyed it. The service was excellent and so was the atmosphere. Overall, enjoyable experience."
lack of initiative to introducing the dishes.,"My partner and I were 1st time here as recommended by a closed friend. We both do not know the name of dishes but just show the picture taken by friends. However, the crew just order for us based on the pictures that i shown to him and without any introduction more about the dishes or the name of it.
The waygu that was tough and with tendons. Fried squid was good. But Dont think will visit again."
Good food,"Ordered a few dishes to share with my partner. The scallops were fresh, seafood stew tasted great and squid ink paella were tasty too. But tasted a portion of it which was salty. Dropped a note to the restaurant that it was my partner’s birthday but they did not prepare any cake :( was quite disappointed and staff were not friendly. Only one thanked us before we left while the manager was busy closing tabs."
Lackluster service mars excellent food,"La Taperia is one of my favourite classic Spanish places in Singapore. It was. Service was brusque , unfriendly and impatient. It’s a real pity because the food is consistent and good. I requested for a small desert for bday celebration which was ignored. The old team was great and knew the customers and was friendly. I do not plan to go back until this is resolved."
Lunch set,"We went for the set lunch menu on a Friday afternoon. Since it was our first visit, the server recommended a couple of dishes to us. I had the beef cheek and hubby had the pork. It was a good decision as the dishes were simply yummy! The beef was served in a hot claypot and it was fall off the bone tender. Pork was also iuicy and tender. For dessert, we had the poached pear in wine sauce which tasted en point except that it would be better if the accompanying scoop of ice cream was a slightly bigger portion. Overall, it was a good satisfying meal."
Great food,Fantastic food and great service. The grilled steak was super flavorful and the seafood stew was really tasty. Highly recommend everyone to try.
Distinctly Average,"For a quite expensive, well marketed restaurant, La Taperia's delivery was very disappointing. First up we ordered a couple of cocktails to start - which basically tasted like water. I am guessing minimal alcohol or other flavourings of any variety were used. Our friends had ordered a couple of dishes to arrive when we arrived, however the staff apparently forgot these dishes which didn't arrive until after the rest of our order (placed about 15 mins later). And the food - very very disappointing. None of the chorizo dishes (we ordered the eggs-potato-chorizo and the chorizo - sausage - peppers) tasted anything like chorizo. In fact, everything was very very bland. The octopus leg was very chewy (ie not cooked properly) and definitely not cooked on a smoking hot grill for a nice char. We ordered the lamb dish - which never arrived - and mussels to finish. The mussels were the only Okay dish. And by that I mean just cooked properly, with a strong garlic flavour (ie. an actual flavour).
We ordered a couple of bottles of wine also, which were very overpriced. The wait staff were not able to provide any recommendations (food or wine) except for the most expensive dishes on the menu (and they had never tasted them so didn't know what they were actually like)."
Great food and attentive service,The tapas selection was great and the quality of the food was exceptional. The overall meal was also good value
My first choice restaurant,"We always book La Taperia every time we visit Singapore because the food quality is excellent, the service is great and they always remember us, the atmosphere is pleasant and the lunch menu is outstandingly good value. We will keep returning whenever we can."
Great food. Great service,"My friends and I have enjoyed the food very much. The staff are also very friendly, helpful and attentive. Love it."
Good Service but portion abit small,Remember the portion is quite ok but this time seems smaller. But nevertheless food is good. Kudos to Romuel who is very attentive to our table.
Good service with great food,"Restaurant manager arranged a table in a private dining area when I indicated that the it was a birthday lunch. Without request, the birthday person was presented with a chocolate mousse cake, nicely plated with a candle. We were 'wowed'!! It was my best experience at La Taperia. Thank-you to the manager and staff Romeo."
Delicious food & slightly pricey,"Went there for lunch and ordered the Gambas in garlic/chili oil, Crispy black ink squid, marinate iberico pork, stew with chorizo & potato & 2 servings of breads.

Iberico pork was really beautifully grilled, tender and delicious Smokey flavour dressed with nice olive oil and spices. The crispy squid was truly crispy and real tasty.. The Gambas was good but could use a bit more chili and garlic and the stew was not bad too.

We had a glass house wine & sangria.. total cost just below S$150.

Wish they had Paella with Pork Secreto (use to order it at Pim Pam)

It was quite packed on a public holiday but Service was really attentive and pleasant.

A bit pricey but overall one of the better Spanish Food we had tried in Singapore"
Lovely restaurant for tapas time!,"Great place, will definitely visit again! Beautiful food, great service, and a very comprehensive wine list!"
Excellent food,One of our favourite family gathering place. Good consistent food and comfortable setting. Service was excellent!
Yummy tapas and mains,Excellent Spanish food. The set lunch is a good deal with almost all the favorite tapas and mains available to choose from. Or go in a group and order alacarte so you can get even more choices.
Mediocre Spanish food,"We had the suckling pig confit and 1 set lunch (Appetizer: fried egg and braised large snail, main: seafood stew and dessert: churros) to share among the two of us. Although it was stated that the suckling pig serves 2, the portion wasn't a lot. The skin of the suckling pig was crispy but unfortunately the meat has a unpleasant strong ""porky"" taste. The fried egg and braised large snail was an interesting combination and taste good. Seafood stew was ok, nothing fantastic and the churros was disappointing. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant and probably won't be back."
Friendly staff and exquisite cruisine,The staff as always very friendly and the ambience was impeccable. Fine Spanish cuisine that will melt your heart.
Food was delicious but service could be improved,"We had a family lunch on a Sunday. Service from the male staff that attended to us was poor - curt bordering on outright rude! After ordering I told him not to serve first as we were waiting for the last guest to arrive but, although he replied Ok, he completely ignored my request and proceeded to serve all the food. By the time the last guest arrived the food had turned cold! The saving grace was that the food was quite good but with so many Spanish restaurants in Singapore this would unfortunately be our first and last visit to La Taperia."
Chonchilla and Grilled Octopus was superbly outstanding!,"Chonchilla and Grilled Octopus was superbly outstanding! Sincerely grateful and thankful to Mus, Pankaj & Tasha for taking good care of us."
Catch-up lunch with friend,Good ambience. Easy access as near to MRT. Would recommend the set lunch as value for money. Service is good as the waitress was very attentive. Had a great lunch and catch-up with my friend. Will go again.
Pricey and Food a little too sweet,"Had 7 starters and two main courses. Food tended to be sweet which makes it wholly un-spanish in taste.
Generally pricey with red wnes starting aat $90.
Not likely to return. Its a shame. Singapore lacks a good spanish restaurant and this one could do better."
An experience that fell short of expectations,"Food quality has dropped. Suckling pig was not crispy, a disappointment. Scallops were fishy, did not taste fresh. Prawns were overcooked, was dry and not sizzling hot when served. Bread was hard."
1st Spain Cuisine,The waiters/waitress are friendly and helpful. The foods recommended are tasty and yummy but not the ambient though. Not disappointed at all.
Good surprise,"First time having lunch there; good food and service. Only thing is the place very cosy, can be quite noisy when customers are loud."
Cosy but noisy,"The place has a nice ambience. But because there was no carpet to absorb the sound, the place became very noisy at the peak of lunch time. Food was okay. The seafood stew was not as hearty as I thought it'd be, with the $10 surcharge and the pieces of tuna were over cooked and tough, and a little fish. Starters and desserts were great. Service was excellent as well."
Food was great!,Enjoy the food and excellent service but table space was too near each other although the 1 meter distancing applies. Could hear customers 2 tables away talking.
Underwhelming food,"Though I heard good reviews from friends who previously ate at La Taperia, my experience was average for the price I paid. Unlikely will return or recommend."
Nice Spanish Restaurant,"I had made a reservation for 4 pax for dinner last night. The place is really nice and quite spacious. We were seated by the window, which was nice. Our waitress / server were attentive. We requested for a physical menu versus scanning the QR code for the menu - not really a fan of reading menu on the iphone, but due to Covid many restaurants have adopted digital menu’s. The menu is quite easy to follow, which is good. We quickly checked references from google maps and ordered a bunch of dishes. We also ordered a nice Red wine Rioja, which paired beautifully with the food and was easy to drink. The starters were significantly better than the mains. Portion wise they were okay (tapas style). Loved the potato brava, burrata and the beef carpaccio was stunning - Super impressed with these. The octopus was really nice but somehow felt less (i would have loved the full tentacle) - it was delicious.

The prawns were avoidable since some of that prawns were chewy (we still ate them anyways!). The seafood paella was a 2/5 for us. A bit bland flavour wise, lacked the sweetness and the juiciness of the seafood. Clams on top were rather underwhelming. Wish this dish had more flavour. Don’t recommend it. I’m told the set lunch is excellent, so I guess we’ll give that a try someday. I’ve eaten in lots of nice Spanish restaurants in Singapore & around the world and this one falls short of being one of my favourite locally. We skipped dessert as we were quite full."
Brilliant as usual,"Wonderful food as usual and service was impeccable. Still my go to place for Spanish tapas! Notable dishes are the prawns with garlic, baby squid, suckling pig croquettes and the baked eggs. Of course the chorizo paella is always perfectly cooked. And the churros are one of the best."
Cosy and Affordable,"What a steal in the heart of Orchard! A good variety of dishes. But do go with their lunch set that is so worth for money! You will be more surprised when you have the food. My beetroot salad with smoked sardines was so refreshing. My partner enjoyed his cheese platter and can’t stopped saying it was so valued for money. My braised beef cheek was so tender that it just melted in my mouth. His lamb dish was nicely cooked, comparable to a steak dish! We ended our lunch high with wine and sugar - of cos in a good way. We had poached pear and churros. Again, they were also nicely done with perfect sweetness. Thanks to the kind staff for being attentive too!"
Excellent,"Great Spanish food, impeccable service. Two points could be improved but didn't affect my rating: the restaurant feels too cold and they should really upgrade their coffee game."
Food was above average but service was below average,We tried the Tasting Menu & the only glitch was the waiter not asking if we wanted medium well for the beef & gave us medium rare instead. It would have been a pleasant experience if not for the rude waiter whose attitude is less than desirable when i used the Chope voucher to settle the bill. He could have just asked for the Code verbally instead of insisting that i place my phone on the table during Covid for him to view the code?!?
Good spanish food with a decent price....,"I just love their Paella. There is a variety of Tapas to choose from, be it cold or warm. I love the Restaurant's atmosphere."
"Food is average , service is lousy","Food portion good for money paid, however service is poor. Waiter seems to be quite rude and impatient (even with normal questions such as ‘what is your recommendation? Or what is your signature’ ). Overall bad experience, will not return"
Not Too Bad,"It was third time lucky, I guess, as our previous two reservations were cancelled after their recent kitchen fire.

The experience started slightly off, with repairs still being done in the kitchen area and a slightly unfriendly male greeter. However, things picked up as the repairs stopped and the female servers were much better.

The charcuterie board was a generous portion, and we especially liked the tomato as well as the proscuitto. The pickled chilli went well too. The butterhead lettuce salad was enjoyable too, with crispy croutons. We paid extra for the iberico pork. It was okay if a tad dry. The beef stew was much better, with its rich aroma and flavour.

The poached pear was the best dish if the day for us, and was thoroughly enjoyable. The churrios were okay, and had a rich chocolate dip."
Poor food quality,Consistently poor food across the spectrum. Overpriced as well. Ambience is decent but does not make up for it
"Great food, lovely wine selection","We’ve been to La Taperia several times & that place never fails to disappoint us. The food is deliciously decent and their wine selection is great and reasonably priced. Ambience wise, La Taperia is cozy, a great for dates for couples and for gatherings with friends"
Great for communal dining,I came here twice both for business dining and I was not disappointed both times. Friendly service with good selections of wine. The Sangria was good as well. The tapas and paella was delectable.
"Excellent food , wine and service.",Excellent food and nice wine too. Great service recommending grilled octopus which is off menu. However a bit pricey too.
Wonderful!,Great food quality & awesome client service! Would love to return very soon again! Highly recommended!
Food n service was great,It was my first time there and I was not disappointed. They have a dinner omakase menu which allowed us to try 8 different dishes. Paired this with a dry rose. Excellent service as well.
Expensive and Loud,"The food at La Taperia was very good but the prices are steep for its ambience and service. Within 1/2 an hour of arriving at the Restaurant, the waiter approached us to inform us that they would be taking their last orders as the kitchen is about to close. Why would you take a 1 pm reservation, if your kitchen is going to close at 2 pm or earlier?"
Deliciosa!,The lobster paella was magnifica 🧡 Churros loved by the kids and even adults 🤤 Would want to come back again to try other dishes !
Great place for Tapas,"This is a great place for some Tapas. Very authentic food, quick and good service. The wine list is very good and provides good options!"
Always a satisfying experience,"This is my 4th or 5th time visiting this restaurant and this time, it was a farewell dinner for a colleague. The food was great and portions were appropriate. The service was excellent and attentive. Highly recommend the squid ink paella, jamon croquettes, chocolate tartelette."
Rude! No customer service!,"-the appetizer was just okay. No wow factor. I ordered Traditional Spanish Appetiser Board
-the waiting time of the main course was so long. I was eating my appetizer while waiting. I waited again another 15 mins to receive my main course. Charcoal grilled Australian Stockyard Beef Tenderloin
-the welcome host was RUDE! he could have said ""oh sir I am afraid I can't see the reservation, maybe it is on the other name perhaps?"" Later did I know that he was the asst. Manager named Kenneth!
-I said my concern to Mus the restaurant manager and was kind and said sorry in behalf of the rude asst. Manager. Mus offered a complimentary wine. But I declined!
-Sorry it is my birthday I thought I will have a good time at the restaurant but unfortunately I didn't.
-Communication skills please!!!"
A sentimental favourite,"I have been coming to this restaurant since 2015 and it's never disappointed. My wife and I had dinner here recently to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and it was our first time back since their latest renovation. The restaurant seats more now and is more spacious. Food is still great - for tapas, we had the garlic prawns, fried egg and lamb ribs; for main, the lobster paella; for dessert, cheese platter. Good wine selection as well; we had a bottle of the Roda Reserva Rioja. There may be snazzier Spanish restaurants in town with more pizzazz, but in the end, we always come back to this humble, unpretentious, sentimental favourite."
Good food but not much of dining ambience,"Like the other reviews for set lunches, I enjoyed the quality of food and the value for money. The octopus is recommended. The duck breast was so so. However service was slow and not attentive and the noise was not conducive for conversation as we were in the section that was narrow and low ceiling. A bit cramped in my opinion."
Weekend lunch,"This is by far still our favourite go to if we're craving for Spanish cuisine. Once you try the food here, i guarantee that you will come back. We've had andalusian and catalan food when we visited Spain and La Taperia has the closest taste we've tried here in SG. My whole family keeps coming back here since we first tried in 2015/2016. No specific dish to recommend, each dish has different unique taste that you must try.

It's worth your $$. If you want to try appetizer, mains and desset with coffee/tea, for a first timer, lunch set will do.

Oops, btw, they just extended, the place is now spacious and have additional decos. This is a good place for couple, family and friends and special occasions to celebrate."
The definition of mediocre,"As the title suggests, this place is average in every way, from the food, service to ambience. Now that's not to suggest I had a bad time there, but it will not be a place I will suggest to my friends."
A very lovely lunch,"The immensely good value set lunches were a true highlight here. It was my second visit, and the food quality seems to have stayed as good as it was before. I truly enjoyed the silky richness of the smoked salmon coupled with the smoky and earthy notes of the Iberico Pork and the wonderful sweet savouriness of the Lamb Rump. I was blown away by how immensely tender the lamb was and how the jus was not something that overwhelmed the natural richness of the meat. It was a meal that I thoroughly enjoyed, and I will most certainly visit again in future."
Lovely night,Great service from William and Jothi. Very welcoming. Very attentive. My first time. Food is ok but service is all you have from here. Thanks William and
Good value set lunch,"Tucked away on the 1st floor of Shaw House, La Taperia scores 4.2 on Google maps. Turned up for set lunch, reservation made in advance. The menu was online (QR code), and options were reasonable with some dishes requiring a topup. WIthout asking, plain water in a glass was made available (well done! it's the only environmentally friendly way to go). Portions were small but satisfying - tasty without being too salty. I'm not sure how spanish some of the options were, but nonetheless, all dishes were well executed. Service was efficient by young servers. I note the dinner menu is quite a bit pricier, but this score is for lunch."
Good value set lunch,"Good value set lunches.However am surprised as the restaurant closed for renovations but menu seems largely unchanged. Service is decent too. There are more tables available for al fresco dining now.However , it seems a little noisy but it""s nice to go with a group of friends. Good coffee and cocktails!"
Good for gathering with friends,"Too noisy for a romantic date, but should be a good place to gather with friends. It is pricey, as with most Spanish food outlets, but you get what you pay for as the food is good. I expected better Sangria though, there was too little wine content."
Nice Ambience,"Food was exceptionally good, tho the table was a little small for the amount of food we order but luckily the dishes came one by one and we were statisfied. Ambience was nice and the service was tip top! Would head back again!"
Yummy Spanish food !,"Very cosy place to catch up with friend over few wines and tapas. Excellent tapa food especially the garlic prawn and spicy sautéed clam! The jamon was really good.. and the squid ink seafood Paella was so so good! The cauliflower with squid is very unique and the fry fish fillet was perfect cooked. Except the lamb ribs that has strong Lamb meat scent that not to my liking. However, wide range of good selection of Spanish wines at reasonable price! Love this place..."
Set lunch & ala carte dinner fantastic!,"First visited in early Aug for a weekday lunch. Set lunch was very affordable and portions were generous. There was also sufficient options in the set lunch for you to really select something you want to eat. The saffron rice was particularly umami.
Visited a 2nd time late August for my birthday dinner and had the opportunity to try more dishes. Every item we had was awesome and some we ordered a 2nd round! The staff were extremely professional, polite and recommend the best dishes. Our group thoroughly enjoyed the food and service and I will definitely be visiting it again soon!"
Disappointed,"We ordered 2 set lunch today. Appetiser and dessert were good.
Disappointed with the set lunch mains: duck breast was undercooked with bloods coming out when cutting it, and lamb rump having fats unrendered well, hard to swallow those parts. A bit disgusted having having the mains."
Chill place for tapas and wine,"Chill place for tapas and wines pre- or post- dinner. Opens till 1030pm given the new Covid-19 guidelines. We had a bottle of red here post-dinner, quite a nice quiet place."
Best bang for buck in this pandemic lockdown,"Ordered the Premium Set for 2 to go for our wedding anniversary due to the lockdown. It was as romantic as we can get with plastic containers.

7 dishes in all and they were all excellent, especially the squid ink battered octopus. Great deal at SG$128 and there was too much food to be finished so I guess we are gonna enjoy the leftovers tomorrow."
Authentic Delicious Spanish Food,"We keep coming back here because of the ambience, quality of food and reasonable prices for the food and wine. We had 7 starters/tapas: Platter of dried ham, Mushrooms with garlic & olive oil, Prawns with garlic & olive oil, French fries (Spanish style), Fried egg with chorizo, Grilled lamb ribs & Grilled Iberian pork. The mains was our favorite Paella Negra with seafood. Finished our dinner with Spanish cheese platter. Total cost for 3 persons with 2 bottles of wine is S$510"
Highly recommended,I have been here a few times and they are always so friendly and helpful! The food is always 1st class and very reasonable. Thank you team as can’t recommend this place more!
Spain in sunny Singapore,"It's almost impossible to comprehend the skills and passion of this outlet, what is evidence is the purity of flavors with a twist, u can close your eyes n pick a winner, just be warned COME IN SOBER N HUNGRY, CHEERS"
Great Value Set Lunch,"La Taperia offers set lunches on weekends, which is a rare thing in Singapore. For $38++ you get a 3 course set lunch including coffee.

Portions are generous and flavours authentic. Some of the tapas are the usual Spanish fare like octopus and potatoes. But there are surprises like the fried squid with ink which is delightfully light and tasty."
"Excellent service, tiny tables and rather small portions","I would give excellent rating to service staff - very friendly and professional, quick to refill the water and know when to check the table.
food: rating average - to be honest I expected more - considering the price the quality of the main plate needs to improve - in my case it was fish (trout was a bit dry) and lentils (you could hardly find any lentils on the plate). saucy seafood dish was good, but not too much rice.
the pineapple sorbet was a bit too watery.

The tables are small but acceptable for two.

the atmosphere is good.

Rather expensive in my opinion"
Expensive Dinner,"We booked our reservation through Chope and we were placed at a non main dining area as per comment by 1 of the reviewer. It may seem so but not sure is it true. Pro - privacy since only 3 - 4 tables in this area Con - cannot seem to enjoy the ambience of the restaurant.
The food is nice but the portion is really small especially the Large Paella which seems like a small size in other Spanish restaurants.
I think it is not worth the money in relative to the ambience & food portion."

Dinner experience in La Taperia using chop booking,"I hv make a booking more than 1 weeks ago using chop for my wife birthday

On the day I visited the restaurant, they bring me to another location which is away from the main restaurant ( I am surprised that this restaurant hv 2 location, and they show me to the table, which is directly face the door, and the restaurant is totally empty, I means not anyone sitting at the table or see any customer there , which is 749 pm, in that case why put me at the worst table when no one and no reservation at all, therefore, I hv to speak to the management, and the response was chop booking is at this place ! That make me not to use chop reservations again as this is treated as second class citizen"
Experience at La Taperia,We were there to celebrate friend's 50th birthday celebration. The food is really good and the staff service is excellent. Highly recommend to those we really enjoy Tapas & Spanish food.
Great lunch,I been there per lunch and deco and service was amazing. Good wine selection and food was ok Cheers🤙🏿🤙🏿🤙🏿
"Delicious Tapas, Warm Service",Made a reservation for two on a weekday evening. Our server was friendly and took the initiative to recommend dishes which are not on the menu. Serving of food was timed well - one after another so that we can enjoy all of them while hot.
Disappointed,"This was my favorite Restaurant in town and I can count on their food being of quality and simply delicious.
After all they part of the ' les amis group ' who take pride in their food
I had many wonderful dinners with friends here.

My last visit was very disappointing, The famous roast lamb was quite raw instead of well done as requested. The 2nd serious lapse was the trust .During the dinner a Chinese waiter asked me if I would like another glass of wine ,I did not hear him saying the name of the wine ,I assumed it will the same wine as the previous glass.

But he gave a more expensive one. Luckily my partner heard and asked me if the wine tasted any better. He then explained the waiter gv me another wine
I was shocked. ITs not the price but the waiter had taken advantage that I was not paying attention and tried passing a different wine quietly . I took it for granted he would give the same wine . I lost my faith in my favorite restaurant.
My partner had a bad tummy all night ,he blamed it on the raw roast lamb.
So sad the standards have dropped so watch out when the waiter whispers"

A satisfying lunch we had,"Girlfriend asked me to check out the lunch set with her. Down to earth, homey, and so satifying. Comfortable environment, non-pretentious service. Will be back to check out other dishes on the menu.

Enquired with restaurant mgr on a upcoming family event, he immediately showed me where he could place our big group, had a pleasant discussion, felt welcome. Thanks to Mus +team."
Best Spanish Food in Town!,"Food here is consistently good, which is why this small restaurant is always packed (NB. Reservation required). For 4 persons, 4 hot tapas and 2 paella (regular size) should be plenty enough. Favorite dishes are the Wagyu beef with truffle sauce and the Giant prawns paella (Specials of the day). Only gripe is that the server did not inform us the prices of the Specials at the time of ordering. When we got the bill, we saw that the Wagyu beef dish was S$95 and the Prawn paella was S$75. Anyway, they were great dishes!"
Disappointing Experience,"I have been going to this restaurant pretty regularly for the last 3 years (at least), and sometimes it can be twice within a 2-3 weeks period. So, the people there do recognise me, and what happened (at my last visit) was a bit disappointing and so strange.

I had gone there with my friend (the same friend whom I always come to this restaurant with) for her birthday. While I had indicated in my reservation that I was celebrating a birthday, I had not said anything when I got there.

After my meal, came out a dessert with a candle on it. Well, guess it was a nice gesture, even though I had not asked for anything. I have been to this restaurant so many times, that they usually do not go beyond their standard service (other than being friendly), so I had no expectations. Thus, when they brought the dessert, I had thought they were doing a nice thing.

When I was presented the bill, there was a charge for an item that I didn't order, When I ask what the charge was for, the staff said it was the birthday dessert. Since I was there with my friend celebrating her birthday, I really did not want to kick up a fuss. Maybe I should not have thought it was complimentary even though I did not order the dessert.

Oh well, it was simply disappointing. My friend and I now decided to find a new restaurant to hang out - time to venture forth to explore other restaurants."
Good spanish Tapas - Refreshing Sangria,Quite good tasty Tapas and Paella. The Sangria is refreshing. A good place in Singapore city centre to have spanish food.
Simply terrible!,"I cannot express how dissatisfied I was with this place. The food is pre-cooked like fast food. It's done by people who never tasted Spanish food and they use the cheapest ingredients. The Gambas al Ajillo was done with a few drops of cheap vegetable oil, stir fried shrimp, and old pre-cooked garlic chunks dumped into a bowl. It was awful. The meatballs were cold in the middle, soft, and tasted like cat food. The olives with cheese was just cheap hunks of cheese with cheap canned olives. It was almost comical until I got the bill. In a word, outrageous. This is a good example of restaurants paying for good reviews. It's a bait and switch. If you don't like western food and want to waste your money, this is the place for you."
They aced everything we ordered,"When my Husband told me we will be heading to a tapas restaurant for our mother’s day celebration, I was skeptical. Firstly, I’m not a fan of tapas and secondly, I don’t think I’ve been to any tapas restaurant in Singapore that blew me away. Until I went to la taperia. Everything we ordered was done so well - gambas, foie gras (MUST ORDER), seabass, squid ink paella and churros.

Will definitely visit again, perhaps with some of my friends the next time."
You’ll always go back !!!,This review is long overdue as we have been frequenting this amazing place for over couple of years now. The food and wine never disappoint and the staff ensure that each visit is worthwhile. One of those places that you would go to after a long week at work.
Good place for family gathering,La Taperia is indeed an ideal place for family gathering and delicious tapas. Excellent service and friendly staff. The roast suckling pig is nice and tender. Will definitely return
Great authentic Spanish tapas.,Food was excellent and well prepared. Great taste and authenticity. Care and knowledge was obvious. Good variety to suit all tastes. Place is small and intimate although no nooks for romantic dining (it’s in a mall). Service was great and efficient and prices were mid range.
Good Tapas and Service,Good place for Tapas at reasonable prices and excellent service. The tapas were delicious and a good variety. Staff was friendly and service provided was excellent. Will definitely return.
Absolutely Divine!,"The best Spanish food I had ever tasted. We had 3 hot tapas dishes followed by a large seafood paella - to share with 2 other family members. Plus one beer and a bottle of Spanish wine on promotion and the total bill was S$215, which included the 20% discount on the Spanish wine."
