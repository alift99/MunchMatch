"Cool restaurant, good food","The overall vibe and decor draw me in to this restaurant. It’s pretty cool. An open bar and also an open kitchen. But it’s a bit too bad that it’s tuck in one corner, so u can’t really get to see how the chefs and bartender prefer the others. Menu is decent but not extensive. Price is average for the quality of food. I had the fish of the day which is sea bass, and I’m pretty surprised it’s served as a whole fish. And together with the accompany sides, I really can’t finish the dish. Overall a good experience!"
Very good and very reasonable,"We went to catch up after not seeing each other since before pandemic! We went for lunch and they provided a set menu. The choices were very unique, the food was excellent and service was fantastic. There are options for all dietary needs so go and explore this unique and tasty little gem"
3.5 stars should be right!,"I like this table at a corner by the entrance yet able to look outside. Chairs are not very comfortable (not sure what material it was). Staff was very friendly but as the evening gets busier, they couldn't cope. Have to grab them to get our bill and we have to pour our own bottle of wine.

Food was good however the Miso Cod fish was way too salty.
Great ambience. Toilet was dismal, very difficult to flush and most time dirty (because most guest doesn't flush!). Staff are way too relax with their mask. One of them constantly have it hanging at his chin while having friendly chat with the guest.

Not very impressed, lots of new resto popping out. Probably won't be back again."
Devastated! Disappointing!,"just nowNEW

We made a dinner reservation for a farewell dinner today, at 8pm, a week ago...and today, when we arrived, we were informed that the kitchen will be closed by 8.30! And the Indian guy sternly told us that ""We tried to contact you from afternoon, THIS AFTERNOON!""
Now, we are all hair stylists and we can hardly see our phone while with clients. Especially today, its so busy, everyone was extremely busy. But the problem is not about you guys having to shut early, we are upset and so disappointed because, we made the reservation A WEEK AGO! And you guys ""tried"" calling us TODAY to inform us about your kitchen shutting early, TODAY??? And reason is because its CNY & MONTH END?????? You guys just found that out today and decided to shut early and tell us today...we made the reservation a week ago! UNACCEPTABLE!"
"High price, mediocre food. Atmosphere over food","Overpriced, trying too hard to be trendy. The portions are very delicate in size, but very hardy in substance. The calamari is 80% fry and 20% squid, for example. Very mediocre food in a fluffed up setting"
Impressed!,"We had a nice dinner here and were well taken care of by Manny and Mai. We enjoyed the padron peppers, roasted cauliflower and Japanese oysters. The tenderloin was slightly too dry for our liking. We'll return to taste the other dishes on the menu. Do check out their list of natural wines!"
Great sharing dishes,My husband and I shared a few plates and the crab croquettes and all were great! The sharing dishes are decent portion sizes and recommend the soft shell crab and eggplant. Giving it a 4 because we were seated right by the street with lots of cars driving past. The setting indoors is much cosier so try to get a table inside.
Great kool vibe and ideal place to chill with friends,"We attended a charity function at this restaurant and found it very welcoming with a great lay back chill factor to it. The first thing you notice is the comfortable chairs on the sidewalk, which invite you to sit and relax. The atmosphere is relaxed and designed to help you relax and enjoy the company of your friends. The food is great and the drinks are cold. Check this place out."
Fusion at its best!,"Great fusion cooking, with large and tasty portions, in one of the historical districts of Singapore. Do not miss the seafood ceviche, and end in absolute beauty with the extraordinary coconut tembleque."
Was initially a little hard,"Was initially a little hard to find as not that clearly signed from outside. It’s on the cross road. Service was extremely friendly and paid lots of attention to my son. Food: pretty good decent portions of ok food. Drinks: this is where I dink a star... prices are high but like most of Singapore... however on ordering the beer and it being half pint for price of pint I decided to opt for the all you can drink beer option. My issue with this is 1: no mention of the time limit you have, 2: the need to chase service to get beer (it would have cost me more than just buying individually if not requested), 3: it’s still ~ £40 for a few pints. It’s ok"
Its all about the vibe....,"My wife & I went there for Sunday brunch and the first thing that struck us was the fantastic location and great design of the place. Polished concrete floors, high ceiling, cool artwork and great attention to detail when it comes to the decor and accessories. Brunch menu is good, with a good range of options and the usual favourites done with a twist. They also serve great coffee!
Service is ok, without being exceptional. They seemed to be understaffed on the day we were there. Overall though, I'd definitely go back just to spend a lazy sunday morning relaxing in an uber-cool environment."
Outstanding,"This place is one of my fave new places in Singapore. OUTSTANDING food, Nice wine list. Awesome service. And a very cool atmosphere."
Small portion for large group sharing,IlSpanish asian fusion food. Portions are too small for large group sharing. Chicken skin with salted egg sauce not worth the price.
Food and Ambience,"Fastastic ambience, great fusion food, friendly staff. Love the squid ink clay pot rice, crab croquettes, grilled spanish octopus and the food portion is just right. Highly recommended and I definitely will be back again."
will not go back,"went for fathers' day, dishes had nothing do with description, went back in September, and we all got sick,"
Pleasantly surprise but menu designed more for sharing,"To be very honest, when I first googled to research about the restaurant for dinner, I wasn’t having very high expectations because most of the pictures that came up were that for its sister establishment Kilo Lounge the bar/club. So even though the subsequent images of Kilo Kitchen that popped up showed a lovely restaurant with nice ambience, I was skeptical about the food they serve thinking “how can a club make good food?” but made a reservation still because I’m a sucker for well designed restaurants.

It didn’t help when I was there and saw the menu. I was looking more for a “proper” sit down dinner kinda place where my friend and I could each order our own food whereas the food on the menu looked very much like bar food meant for sharing. Add that to my initial club perception of the restaurant and you can see why I wasn’t expecting much.

But was I pleasantly surprised!

We ordered a Mala Burrata to start, with Squid Ink Rice and Mushroom Gniocchi as mains to share before ending the night with a Coconut Panna Cotta. I have to say the food all turned out way better than I have expected, be it in terms of flavor, taste or presentation. I especially liked the Squid Ink Rice but wished they had really fired it up in the claypot that they served the rice in to create a burnt layer at the base. That would have really been a fusion of cooking styles!

Most importantly, the service by the staff has been nothing short of excellent. Friendly people, always serving with a smile, from the time I arrive, asking for recommendations for the food and wine, till we left for the night.

Only reason why I stopped short of giving it a full 5 stars is because of the price. For the portions that was served, I’d say the price they charge is on the high side. And given that Kilo Kitchen was designed to be the kinda restaurant where you share food (haha, I was right about the bar food concept!), you most likely have to order quite a fair bit to go around for everyone to get their fills so you can imagine how the bill will come up to be on the high side.

I would highly recommend you to give Kilo Kitchen a try because the ambience, food and service is really good. Unfortunately, it won’t be my regular dining option due to the high price tag. Also, you’ll have to adjust your mindset to share food because there’s not much on the menu to order your own food. The portions are really quite small and you most likely need to order a few things to share in order to get your fill."
A revisit to the restaurant,"We had team dinner with four ladies. We arrived early so we were able to enjoy the $20 below but one get one free, and $38 for a starter, a small plate and a side/ dessert.

It had great cocktails and good choice of healthy food and cook into a modern fusion way.

We had grilled beetroot, grilled avocado, kale salad, ceviche, deep fried chicken skin, burrata, wasabi tuna tartare etc. So much food

Open air indoor area was perfect for chatting and hanging out with friends."
Awesome brunch,"Nice, chill place for brunch and meetups. Chicken & Waffles was juicy and fragrant; the mimosa was a great way to start the day. Shoutout to Grace and the team for the interesting conversation and cheering up my Sunday morning! Salamat!"
Disappointing,Several dishes were decent especially the steak. Whole table was sharing yet had to ask the same guy serving to bring a fork and a spoon so we could portion. You would think after 9 times it was not a surprise question. We were in a rush to go to another place but food was very slow in arriving. They apparently forgot to bill wine and called next day. They called next day and made us aware of the problem. We asked them to come to the office with the bill and we would settle immediately. Reply was you must come here and until you do we will deduct the servers salary......nice style and shifty service from someone clearly a manager. My last time for sure!! How can you run a place and secure staff when that is the way you think
Good ambience,"Went to this lovely little restaurant on 4th June with family. Cozy place with a good ambience. Ordered their spicy margarita drink which was quite unique and as the name suggests, quite spicy. Bar snacks included the Pan dish which was toasted bread served with a side dip. The sides included burnt carrot dipped in what tasted like Indian ghee which was again, very unique. The only suggestion i would give is to have a couple of more vegetarian options, especially in the main course, however i understand that the majority of their clientele may not be veg like me. Other than this, quite a nice place for an evening out"
Cute tapas-style bar or cocktail place,Great food to share - tuna cerviche was especially memorable. Good wine list and not ridiculously priced.
Nice spot,"Good service , good food , cool part of singapore on a corner where you can eat inside and outside Try the ink squid and IPA beer Cocktails we’re amazing"
Nice atmosphere and good food,"We were a group of 4, and looking to have an enjoyable start to our evening. Over the course of our 2 hour stay, we ordered a few bottles of wine and many, many plates off of the menu. Nothing remained."
Booking required - half empty restaurant,"We attempted a walk-in to kilo kitchen the first night we got to Singapore as we were really drawn to it’s aesthetics and the ambient music however we didn’t have a booking and although the restaurant was half empty, we were told they were booked out.

The following night we walked past around 7pm and it looked half empty again. Decided to approach the hostess to see if we could perhaps get a table for 2 or sit at the bar and have a red but she just told me they were fully booked. Disappointed in our attempt, we wondered around the corner to Lucha Loco and it such a pleasant find! Beautiful Mexican with a cool garden setting happy to host.

On our walk back to our accom we noticed Kilo kitchen still had all the same empty seats. We are actually so confused by this point. Who turns away business?
-
In summary, I don’t doubt Kilo kitchen has fantastic food and great ambience but it’s insane to me that they have empty tables for over an hour when walk-ins are wanting to have a drink at the bar or even a meal and are turned away for a booking that’s coming god knows when.

So I wish I could review better for Kilo kitchen but that was our experience. Go to Lucha Loco."
Welcome,"Great to experience Kilo in this new location - as usual great drinks , atmosphere and food :-) just opened will definitely be back"
Poor service,"Unfortunately we weren’t able to finish our dinner. After two hours waiting for our mains, we ended up cancelling the order because they never came!"
Excellent for pre-dinner drinks,Really nice ambience and tasty small plates to hare with your friends and a drink. The area is also one of Singapoes best for eating and drinking.
"Awesome restaurant, vibe",Wow. The food here is amazing. So is the atmosphere. And the service. Super relaxed Balinese vibe with good wine by the glass. A standout in the area.
Must order Squid ink rice,Dinner was so good we went back for lunch. You got to try their Squid ink rice. Absolutely in LOVE with it.
Never Disappoints!,"Loved the original Kilo in Kallang, absolutely adore everything about Kilo in Bali (shoutout to their manager Alejandro), missing their Orchard location, bananas for their new Duxton Hill location. Everything from the decor, ambiance, warm service and most importantly food was spot on. The tuna tatare, squid ink rice, corn, soft shell crab with watermelon... everything’s good here, everything’s a crowd pleaser. Wish there were more desserts & if they ever do brunch, they should definitely bring back their huevos rancheros - to die for."
Great place,"Great food, great stuff, hope the new place will be as good as the old one! Fish is a must as well as some of the salads!"
Super disappointing,"We headed to Kilo Kallang following a recommendation from a friend of a friend. The raw tuna and broccolini were great but the balance of the food was really disappointing. The soft shell crab had more batter than crab and was super oily.

Service was OK. Given all the amazing food options in Singapore, I’d give this one a miss."
Expect the unexpected,"Every dish is a surprise. We ordered spicy pomelo salad, quinoa, garlic mussels, crispy soft shell crab, Ceviche, grilled fish and grilled iberico collar. For dessers, we ordered the sourdough beignets and ice cream cone.
It was very interesting on how the dishes taste different from how it looks because there are many layers of flavors and texture in each dish. Conclusion is the ""dirty Quinoa"" dish is our favorite because it reminded us of Thai olive fried rice and yet, a twist on its texture."
Great food for special occasion,"I visited Kilo Kallang with my friend for a birthday celebration.

Location: Kilo Kallang is located near Kallang river. We took a 20 min walk from Farrer Park mrt area as we were there for some other activity. However, the nearest station is probably Kallang. It was a nice and pleasant walk. We walked to Bugis post dinner.

Restaurant: There are 2 parts of Kilo: 1 is the charcoal club which has a nice relaxed atmosphere with outdoor BBQ, the other is the Restaurant upstairs. We went to the Restaurant upstairs. The atmosphere is great and there was a mix of families having gatherings, friends night out and couples on dates. The Restaurant is air conditioned. However, the Restaurant can get quite noisy and loud.

Staff: the staff was very friendly and well trained. They were patient with us as we took our time to choose our starters and main course.

Food: We opened our meal with the Makgeolli Passion cocktails which was really good. We told them that we wanted the cocktails less sweet and they customised it for us. We had 2 starters from the Raw section (Korean beef tartare and Ceviche). Both were fresh with amazing flavours. We ordered the 45-day aged Angus beef, Prawn and Ebiko pasta and Grilled broccolini & Stracciatella for our main courses. The beef was too charred for my liking although some parts of it was ok. The pasta was cream-based and I find it too rich / creamy. The prawns in the pasta was too burnt and dry as well. The broccolini is good but some parts were too fibrous. It was the best out of the 3 dishes.

Pricing: Kilo is considered more pricey as their dishes are between high $20s to $30s.

Overall: although the beef and pasta fell short of my expectations, the starters were really good. I would visit kilo again and try other dishes!"
"Nice interiors, great ambiance","I want to Kilo with my Wife after a Long time and did not get disappointed. The ambiance overlooking the river is still the same, and the quality of food and hospitality continues to be great. We ordered the soft shell crabs, ebiko pasta, pomelo salad, empanadas and more and were really happy we did. Great place to go back to."
Nicely Alternative for Singapore,"Close to 5 stars. Kilo as a venue is not what one expects of a restaurant in Singapore. It is not located in a commercial area for a start. That’s because it’s housed in an old HDB (government built high density housing block) on the first floor (F2). It’s somewhat bladerunneresque with exposed concrete and services. Like an abandoned warehouse taken over by Malay cyberpunks. The big news is, however, that these cyberpunks have excellent culinary abilities. Food was great. Especially wasabi tuna sashimi, gnocchi and charred octopus. It’s Asian fusion but strong Japanese slant. Good cocktails- especially ‘A Sure Thing’.
Waitresses are great and very helpful. Prices are not cheap but worth it. Strict timing and 2hr dinning slots indicate how popular this place is but we were not rushed out. A casual bar attracting a young ex-pat crowd has developed outside on the ground floor. Drinks not cheap - buzzy dystopian atmosphere but not same standard as the restaurant."
More style over substance,"Setting was unusual for Singapore so was excited by meal to come, the word fusion is always a worry we had most of the dishes available and can not really say I would hurry to order any again, trying to be to clever !! Crispy soft shell crab was very tasty but served in chunks of watermelon which made the tempura batter cold and soggy.
Maybe I am being a tad harsh, but expensive and would not return."
Absolute Favourite.,"I've been a big fan of Kilo since I first dined in at the Orchard Central outlet when they first opened, unfortunately it has closed. But that has not stopped me from trying their other outlets. From the one in Bali to the one in Kallang, I've never been disappointed. Keep up the great work!"
Great food but a little pricey and not that romantic,"Atmosphere pretty hip, industrial, no fuzz but cosy. Good service but nothing note worthy to say. Great food, wonderful flavors and nice presentation. Good combinations of different influences and nicely balanced. We had the daily specials, some beef with ""taco's"" and pork with chinese pancakes.
My cocktail was a daily special as well, with an interesting combination of ingredients but a bit too ""complicated"" for my taste. I like them a bit more simplistic and pure.
Overall I would definitely recommend the place, but more for a dinner with friends than for a romantic get together. The music was too loud for that and the decor just too minimalistic."
Good charcoal meat,"We were 8 people for lunch today.
Overall - ok food excepted desserts and patates bravas.
The worst point of this place is the service!
Our waitress brought spicy food when we highlighted “no spicy sauce”, didn’t know anything about the food menu when we asked questions, was not able to bring spoon together with dessert, and finished by doing mistakes in the bill payment..
Anyway, out of the 8 friends we were, we don’t think we will come back."
Still good!,"While we are living in Singapore for almost 4 years, quality of the food and atmosphere is still great. The tables and chairs need replacement, table unstable and not right hight and chairs are uncomfortable, all in all sitting position is not good. For the rest great food and staff, just a point of attention after 4 years!"
Amazing Food and Atmosphere,Extremely friendly service in a special atmosphere. The fusion kitchen offers a wide range of dishes. The soft shell crabs are amazing!
What an amazing place,"Such a great place, staff was great - amazing wines and food! Try the beef shortrib tortilla and the tuna tartare! Wauw!"
"Great food, funky atmosphere, but mixed service","Visited on the market day, and enjoyed lots of stalls. BBQ style food was delicious. Sides were amazing.
Staff moved our table out from the cover, when it stopped raining, then it poured. Staff should spend less time moving furniture around and more time clearing plates and bottles."
Get your dose of grilled food here,"Camp Kilo was good for kiddos. The kids' menu wasn't too big but was sufficient. There were also other finger food available. Worth mentioning were the tostones or ""patacones"" as known in some parts of South America (though I think they could be made a little thinner). Overall food quality was good, relaxing ambience with latino/ carribean music. Price was quite alright. Kids were busy with activities such as bracelet making using flowers, treasure hunt etc. Also frequented by expatriates."
The best doggie bag in town,"This is review is actually for Kilo Kitchen, which is right above Camp Kilo but it is a pain to get TripAdvisor to list a new venue ... btw, the location is on the Kallang River with beautiful dusk views.

We showed up early at 6pm for the early bird special: $75 for 5 dishes to be shared by two. We ordered another dish (above $20) for our daughter. The Italian / Japanese fusion food is quite impressive. It has been around for five years. So a hidden gem indeed!"
Buzzing,"Camp Kilo is steeped in its own little charm and rocks out some amazing BBQ. Staff are cool and the setting is retro; good place to chill with friends. Recently attended their July 4th evening, co-hosted by Decker BBQ; it was a great night and really enjoyed the atmosphere. Decker in my view outplays everyone on the BBQ front, but 'Kilo' has a buzzing vibe that nicely breaks you into your weekend!!"
Could Be Better,"I went there for an event. The first thing I noticed upon approaching that place is the really loud music. When I settled down with my group, the music gets
more and more annoying. The volume is too high. The sound system is not great. That place does not have good acoustics. And the music they placed - latino - is only great if you want to dance with a partner. Otherwise the repetition just drives you mad. I was told by my group that they had requested for the volume to be tuned down but the request was flatly rejected. With the super loud music, we had to shout all night to talk. We had to
make a brief announcement within our group and had to move to one corner of the premise and stand around that area to do it.
The food was average and could be brought out in a timely and smooth manner. Many of us had to wait a while and a big batch came out towards the end.
I asked the server for a Coke and was told I need to go to the counter to order it. I went to the counter and placed my order. The staff, who seemed to be a senior staff, held a cup of ice and a can of coke and was about to give to me and collect the money when he interrupted by a junior staff asking for advice. He left me standing there 2-3 minutes until he finished his coaching before fulfilling my order. I told him he should have completed my order before talking to his staff and letting me wait, and he 'rolled' his eyes at me. I could see on his face the message: Don't tell me what to do."
Romantic dinner,Excellent experience. Food is exceptional and combinations of flavors are wonderful. we tried and shared various dishes and all were simply define. Ask the waiter for the best sellers and you get the best. The setting itself is pretty cool too. At first the place itself was a bit difficult to find.
Painful,"Arrived about 7.30pm. No crispy pork belly for an hour, ours is the last order of most meat before they run out. Order alternatives (not easy). Wait 40mins. The. Find out all our food has been delivered to another table! No option but to get a refund and leave. They should really implement a better system rather than shouting a table number over loud music. How about take a number? It's no so hard. Found the table that got our food... knee deep in empty containers. So angry. Never again."
Don't eat the raw food,Came on a Saturday night and it was really happening - surprising for an industrial building. Get reservations otherwise one may not be able to get a seat. The vibe was just great. We had a lot of small plates and most of the food was good. However my partner got a stomach upset and he suspects it's from the uni starter. My stomach was a little less upset: we didn't eat anything else that evening except at Kilo.
Fantastic Fusion - MUST TRY,"We went on a Monday evening for my Wife's birthday, the place seemed about 85/90% full.

Staff in general were prompt, but lacked basic service skills e.g. serving ladies first, waiting for a lady to be finished eating before trying to clear plates, serving wine without showing your back or reaching over unnecessarily - (walk around the table instead). Most discouraging of all, one waiter kept looking at his watch even whilst in conversation with customer, if it wasn't an age or lack of training I would have assumed he was hinting HURRY UP (it was before 10pm thru to 10.30pm).

Menu font size was about 7pt, way too small, and off black/blue text on brown paper, so in dim lighting was very hard to read.

The fit out designer needs to check themselves, the mini-halogens on track lighting were very hot to sit under, and I'm sure would be killing Kilo's electricity bill (but do make great for photos of dishes). But I also see this as we were just unlucky as we were in the only corner not covered by a fan. However most of the place is very well ventilated, and best of all there was good distance between tables, so you are not packed in like sardines and rubbing elbows with neighboring tables as you would in a downtown or city location.

The food was very good, we started with: Korean Beef Tartare, Truffled Tai Yuzu Roll, Beetroot Salad and Seared Scallops. All these dishes are definitely worth eating and ticked all the boxes in ways of flavour and texture. Very happy palates :)

For Mains I had the White Snapper Milanese and my Wife had the Squid Ink Rice, in my opinion the Snapper won hands down, as the squid ink rice is quite heavy on the palate, so it needed either an additional slice of lime or be sure to have a wine with hints of acidity to complement the dish.

For Desert the Restaurant wrote happy birthday on the plate for my wife - and did a great job with correct spelling (most places misspell), she had the chocolate lava cake with hazelnut ice cream - I had Churros. Both desserts were awesome.

We went as a couple, but I think next time we would make sure to go in a group so to be able to sample more of the menu.

8.5/10"
Some of the best food in Singapore,"I've eaten here before but this time reminded me of how good it is. Food was excellent. Every dish was good. Service was really good, which is rare. And price was good for what you get. Best meal all year."
Amazing Vibes!,"My friend and I came here for dinner and the food was delicious!
It is definitely hard to find nice vegetarian food in Singapore so I was very happy to have come there for dinner!
The vibes are amazing - it was quite warm when we went, we stayed outside and enjoyed being brought together with lots of other people from different nationalities!
I highly recommend if you are in the area!!!

"good food, the ribs are great!","visited them during lunch time on a Saturday. There's only a few people.

We ordered ribs, chicken, crispy pork belly, pickles, brussels and carrot. forgot what they call them, but what's good is we enjoyed them.

the ribs were juicy awesome great. definitely will order again.

the chicken was tasty and juicy.

the pork belly was ok. i think the quantity is quite less for the amount.

the brussels were the best i tried. a must buy!

the carrots were cooked well.

the pickles.... the flavor is too strong for my taste.

overall, we'll definitely comeback! excited to try their lechon.

i wish they served rice..."
Easy dining quality food nice vibe,"Don't be daunted as the taxi takes you down a poorly lit street to a building with no spectacular entrance.
Take the rustic elevator to the first floor and it opens into the bare cantina style feel of the restaurant.
The food is Asian fusion and was great, the ceviche, scallops and ribs being particularly great. The wine list was short but the wines we tried were good. The ambience was casual but allowed group chats amongst the party of 8 along with bawdy laughter without disturbing anyone.
If you drive there is a car park at the end of the street.
Would def go back"
Vegetarian unfriendly place with impolite staff,"Happened to pop by the restaurant on Friday night with work colleagues. Being a vegetarian, I reviewed their menu prior and knew it lacked vegetarian options. When I reached there, I politely suggested that they should look into improving their vegetarian options and the staff retorted ""What can we say, we love our meats"". Who in the world says that to a vegetarian customer. I was made to feel unwelcomed and unwanted in this restaurant. And was made to dine with such an experience. No one should be made to feel like that in any restaurant. And then be expected to pay. Appalled.

The least I expected was to have the chef tailor make a main dish for me (or other vegetarians) and at least make me feel welcome. But then again, we are talking about people who treat with disrespect."
Kilo Lounge - Kiddo friendly,"If you want to have a stylish yummy evening with friends and with kids try out Kilo lounge or the BBQ on their entrance terrace. And if you stay longer you might shake your bootie in the top floor, where the club is located. The Ceviche is a must, so are the tacos. Salads are rich and wine selection fabulous."
Friendly staff and good food!,"the food here is pretty good, service was very friendly and prompt, nice view of the river, overall and nice ambience and experience"
Midweek birthday dinner,"I went to Kilo for my birthday celebrations with some girlfriends. Arriving at this old HDB (Housing Development Board), it was a bit of an adventure just figuring out if there was an elevator up to the restaurant! There was and it's just in the 2nd level.

The service was very good for the night. (In my opinion - this is pretty rare in Singapore!). The atmosphere was great- the restaurant was full which was surprising to me for a Tuesday night but the space between the tables was greater than most restaurants which lent to a sense of space and privacy. And clearly they had well trained staff and w ouch wait staff to cater for all the tables.

We selected some starters from the raw and small sections to share and we each ordered a main course. The tuna tartar was the winner.
Although the restaurant is categorised as a Japanese restaurant - this is more apparent in the raw and small dishes rather than the mains. I was surprised (and disappointed) to see white snapper ""Milanese"" - why ruin a fish with breadcrumbs?!
The steak looked very good ans 3 of my group all reported it was very good. I had the lamb shank - a dish I normally wouldn't choose but it seemed the 'cleanest' of the choices. And it was delicious - it fell off the bone and with the clear broth and fresh coriander it was truly delicious.
Cocktails, prosecutors and red wine matched our meal - before, during and after - the drinks menu was pretty good.

I would definitely recommend a visit to this pretty unique restaurant if you get a chance.

Tip*** try booking a table near a window."
One Of the best restaurants in Singapore,"Delicious dishes and an original menu. Totally recommended for those a bit foodies. The restaurant is in the middle of an industrial area , which makes it even a more special experience. They have a drinks bar downstairs , so you can start or end the night in there."
Excellent cafe style gourmet food but a tad expensive,"Went to this highly rated cafe style restaurant with my family for dinner. Service was very good and so was the quality of dishes served. Pricing of wines was good. However, we felt the over prices quite steep."
Good vibe. Good BBQ.,The food was good. Vibe was great. This Sunday they had family activities and the kids had a good time. Check their site in advance. But the wait time for the food and the line was long - at least 45 min to 1hr. Enjoyed it overall but wait was long.
Really good fusion food,"Had Ceviche with a very tasty sauce, Grilled Octopus also very tasty and the Ravioli! Everything is super good in terms of food, just for this price, I would expect bigger portions. Music a bit too loud, lowering it would be nice I think. To try!"
Fusion tapas,"I have been to this restaurant a couple of times. Since the last time, it has enclosed and air conditioned its main dining area. The plates vary in size but they tend to be small so one would want to order a few for a meal. Everything that I tried has been excellent, though some dishes have been more memorable than others. I loved the ribs and the steak. If you go around 6pm, they have an early bird special which is an excellent deal (they also have 2 for 1 beers before 7pm). Highly recommended."
Family Lunch,Went for Sunday lunch with Wife and 2 daughters . Great spot in a sort of unusual location. Thank god for GPS. The chipotle corn was great with two thumbs up from my 12 year old. Pomelo salad not authentic Thai but very refreshing with lots of mint. Pork belly and whole snapper with garlic butter were great. Chicken a bit light on flavour. Lechon tasty and pretty oily. Enjoyed the lunch.
An original place !,"Far from the shopping malls and all the same restaurants, Kilo has a strong identity ! Located in a HDB, the design is really original and not common. The food is a real discovery, a fusion cooking between the eastern and the western one, flavored, tasty and really original. The only bad point is the noise. Depending on where you are seated, it might be noisy and difficult to follow a conversation. Kilo is one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore, sure !"
Fantastic,In a city full of great food Kilo takes it to the next level. Everything we ordered was delicious but two standouts were the grilled octopus and the blood orange clams. Will definitely be going back.
"Good service, good food","We were there on a Friday night. Got our reservation mixed up and showed up a day early. Fortunately, they were able to accommodate us with a ""vacate-by"" time.

The venue, on the second floor is pleasant. Sealed concrete floor, bare walls, a couple of pieces of modern art on the wall, somewhat of a view for a few tables. Music a tad loud, because we were sitting right under a speaker, I suppose.

Interesting selection of cocktails. I tried the chili margarita. Very good. Caution, the bar tender has a very generous pour!

Kilo's menu is really eclectic and I asked for a tasting menu. They only offer this from 6-7pm mon-thu, so Friday is a la carte. Don't get the logic, but ...

Since we were two couples, we ordered a bunch of appetizers, hot and cold and a main or two, to share. Caution, the servings are rather large, we were full before we got to the mains.

We had three different raw fish dishes: ceviche, poke and tartare. All uniquely presented, from different parts of the world, LatAm, Hawaii and Europe respectively. However, they all tasted essentially the same.

The tongue tacos were very tasty,

The softshell crab was good.

The most interesting dish was a Japanese Caprese, where the bufalo was replaced by tofu. Unfortunately, the tomatoes were not Japanese, but the local tasteless kind.

The charred octopus was not so charred, nonetheless very tasty, served over a bed of mashed potatoes.

Too full for dessert."
Top for sharing,"Four of us shared a variety of dishes here for dinner last night. From smaller plates to mains they are all suitable for sharing. We absolutely enjoyed each dish. The duck salad was a standout. The only one that maybe was not value for money was the scallop dish, a bit too expensive for just 4. Great atmosphere with a table overlooking the river. All in all a wonderful place to visit with really tasty food."
The best meal we had in Singapore,Every dish we ordered was an explosion of surprising but exquisite flavours. The kitchen team are doing an amazing job creating beautiful and delicious dishes. The service was brilliant - our waitress took extra care to keep us informed of ingredients in all our dishes after she learnt one of us had a fish allergy. And the drinks are not overpriced (for Singapore!) We had a really lovely evening here and thoroughly recommend it.
"OK food, service lacking","We went here with our friends for NYE 2016. Read so many good reviews so I was ready for the best food ever. We arrived and were seated promptly. Good start. Nice vibe to the restaurant (upstairs). We had the 9 course set menu. While the food was ""okay"", the service was missing. Timing off, our waitress kept trying to rush us, food wasn't delivered to everyone (party of 6) at even nearly the same time, no one explained the menu or what was being served. I wasn't wowed by any of the food at all. Maybe things were off due to NYE but not sure I'm going to go back."
Never misses- great food - great service - great atmosphere,We go as a small group - get one appetizer and one main each- then share. It works the best. Not a big wine list but what is there is all very good. I love to take friends from out of town here. The restaurant is walking distance from the Lavender MRT for those who might be put off by the location. Don't miss the soft shelled crabs in curry!
"Unique little bites, wonderful atmosphere","On a recent trip to Singapore, my wife and I visited Kilo Kitchen in Kallang. This restaurant is near the Rochor River and so it feels ""off the beaten track"" and has an obviously different vibe than you'll find at one of Singapore's many food hawker centres or restaurant locations within the city's many shopping malls. The Kallang location is wonderful and unique and perfect for couples.

Kilo's concept is a sharing menu where you and your dining partner try several small bites (raw or cooked, I recommend you try a bit of both). As I mentioned, it is the perfect place for couples and the sharing menu is the perfect setup for this.

Our choices were: spiced salmon sashimi, chicken bulgogi, seared scallop, and black and white prawn ravioli. We finished off our meal with some churros a dish which comes complete with a cooked marshmallow, covered with spiced chocolate and the churros are sprinkled with a match sugar. All of these dishes were delicious.

It is not the cheapest place to dine in Singapore, but it is amongst one of the best! The small bit dishes are unique and well done; you'll want to try them all!"
Simply excellent,"One of our friends brought us to this restaurant saying it was one the best he experienced in Singapore.
I have to say he was right ! We decided to take different dishes to share and one of the most amazing are the scallops (see picture) and the tuna tartare.
The atmosphere is also very casual and nice considering the cuisine.
This restaurant is just a bit hard to find. It looks like it is a residential area.
Thanks for the nice moment we had there !"
Fantastic,"Excellent, surprising meal for dinner. Great service. Very happy to have had this experience. Easy uber ride from town."
"Great, chill place","Great place for grill and BBQ food. The spareribs and Snapper were perfect with the added spices. But also the Side dishes were very tastefull (patatas bravas & grilled carrots). We were told it was always really busy, but I guess we were lucky as there were more than enough tables available; it was a sunday evening after all.

I think they have a changing menu, but I have attached a photo of the menu."
Delicious...everything,"Wonderful dinner at Kilo. Appertizers were gorgeous and looked really pretty. The beef tongue taco's were my favourite of the evening, but the scallops and octopus were great too. Definitely a place to go again"
Eclectic Kilo,"An unusual setting, but one we liked. The food is quite unusual in style too, but original and largely excellent. Tuna tartar, scallops, fusion type food- some more successful than others perhaps. We had the Early Bird, and it is really very good value indeed, but I guess it could add up outside of Early Bird. It made for a most enjoyable experience."
Great venue but expensive for what you get,"Went there Saturday after with my wife and I and two daughters. We had 1 bottle of wine and enough food for 4 and somehow the total came to nearly $300. The ribs were very mediocre being a bit tough and soggy while the it took two portions of the pork belly to add up to a enough for one person and even then it was, well... mostly fat. The little salad thing was ok but i couldn't finish it, the plantains were nice, the eggplant was inedible and the cornbread was pretty poor at $5 per piece. The potatoes were also forgettable (i almost forgot we had them). ALSO, the beer selection is ridiculous! I would much rather have had one good IPA (or similar) vs the bottle of white wine but all they had was Sopporo and I just can't bring myself to drink that %^$%^$#. Furthermore, this venue is BEGGING for a decent beer selection!

So, while the venue is a perfect laid back outside location where you feel a million miles from Singapore, the whole dining experience needs a total revamp or this place will be dead in a year. I certainly won't be going back."
Spectacular food and wine in unusual setting,"We had a great night at Kilo on Thursday; we enjoyed the food and wine very much. Staff was attentive. We were seated close to open kitchen, which was actually not best location. Bit noisy. Only downside was that there was just 1 toilet available; restaurant was packed so we had to queue.....not very convenient during business dinner."
Ohhh! Let down!,"Was let down by this place of which I had heard so much.You see a picture of a pig being roasted but even after reaching before 6 pm,its already cut in pieces.
Service is pretty slow and you have to do with Sapporo,like it or not;carry your bottle opener.You have to stand in front of a board to know the menu and then stand in a q to order.
The food is good-had pork ribs,pork belly and roast pork with red snapper."
THE BEST!,"it's a small place with amazing food. the food was in big portion, so you could share it with your partner or friends. the music was nice and the ambiance is perfect. it would be great to go here for a nice dinner or maybe an anniversary celebration with your partner."
Fun new place in out of way location,"Kilo is really two places. Ground level is an open air BBQ casual restaurant which last Saturday night was really hopping. We will definitely come back and try it.
We actually ate upstairs in a converted old factory. Low ceiling and industrial fittings didn't make the place great looking, but the food was worth it. Very different and somewhat experimental. Not every dish worked but the ones that did were pretty amazing. The cocktails were also quite different and worth trying. Overall, a very welcome addition to the restaurant scene albeit a bit pricey and out of the way"
Innovative cuisine,"Staff were very informative and friendly. Food was excellent. Loved the combinations. Our group of three shared everything as we didn't want to miss out. We enjoyed discovering new flavour combinations. The desserts were divine, perfectly balanced in terms of textures."
Absolutely delicious ribs!,"Dropped in for a quick lunch during a bike ride around the bays. We sat outside as it was a great day for outdoor dining. The ribs were by far some of the most tender and tastiest I have ever had. The sauce was perfect, not too sweet. One of us also had the Pomelo salad which was quite spicy (too much for them) but delicious. Lunch is a pretty casual affair with food and drinks ordered from the bar. The food overall was very good."
"Great place, great food!",Excellent food in a very cozy and intimate environment with amazing service and drinks. What more do you need? A must for fusion Asian food!
Great evening,Came here wth 15 friends . Turned out to be more of a drinks evening but a great place and very friendly staff. Outdoors are just wonderful in the evenings. Loved it.
Excellent!,"Really delicious food and friendly service. Came here with a group of hungry teens and adults and everyone enjoyed it and polished off their food.

Only criticism was wine was rather ropey so best stick to beer!"
Disappointing,"Waited for 45 minutes after ordering in what seemed like a manageable friday evening. Only 1 out of 3 main dish finally came. 0 out of 3 sides were served. When we clarified with the waitress, she said that the kitchen claimed all the food had been served already! We couldnt wait anymore having waited so long, so we left having only had the fish...and lots of water to satisfy our rumbling stomachs. The management did give a full refund, to their credit, and even admitted it wasnt a busy night for them. Thanks, but no thanks. A pity since we live nearby and would have loved to make this a regular haunt."
Kilo Under Pressure,"These guys are certainly creative and great at what they do.

I have been to Kilo for the bar atmosphere on a Friday, but until recently, had never dined in. It was a very cool experience.

'Kilo under pressure' is when a normal person steps up to the challenge of preparing/cooking a meal for the entire restaurant over a few courses. While you can't expect 5-star creations, the Kilo kitchen crew who obviously keeps the bar high, ensures the meals are pretty darn close.

Will be back for the next one - and to dine in general. I believe the owner is very conscious of buying ethically reared meats and supports the 'conscious consumers' Eco-system, which I value."
Yummy bbq at Camp Kilo Charcoal Club,"This is the weekend, outdoor manifestation of the Kilo experience. The BBQ is phenomenal. Try everything. The (whole) fish, the roast pork, the ribs.... The roasted veggie sides, the corn bread, even the dreaded Brussel sprouts is so shiok you'll die from food orgasm. It's not cheap... The meats (per 100 grams) and fish ($20) are worth it, but the size to price ratio of the veggies make it expensive. Taste wise, I'd say you HAVE to order it though, so you're kind stuck there.

If nothing else, just have 2 full slabs of ribs and beers with the mates - that's all you really need. They even sell super cheap bottles of alcohol - 100 bucks - but be warned... They whack u on the mixers. The frozen margaritas are wickedly delicious and strong.

Super time for a weekend brunch. Don't go too early on a Saturday though... They advertise 11am opening, but they're usually not ready for service until 12, so do keep that in mind when planning. Maybe management might consider changing the published time to 1130 instead? Also, reservations are online, only for 10 Pax and above, and take a few days to secure....So keep that in mind when booking.

I've been here three weekends in a row.... I wonder why! ;)"
Superb,"A Friend suggested this restaurant, superb service, food and drinks including a clever and well priced wine list for Singapore with interesting varietals across the white and red spectrum, probably only six or seven of each but chosen extremely well. The food's for sharing and all the better as you want to talk about it! I won't single out any dishes because they were all fabulous however you simply must keep room for the molten choc cake and raspberry sorbet, again a sharing treat. With huge glass windows, leafy views, the venue is riverside at Kallang so it's not really somewhere to walk to unless you live nearby. Oh and ask about their cocktails, yummy."
Amazingly awesome broccoli!,"Really impressed by this restaurant , the char grilled broccoli with yogurt and feta was delicious, as was the beetroot with arugula. I also tried the gnocchi which were very good."
Excellent meals and great moment at Singapore,"Yesterday I and my family ate dinner at kilo's restaurant. It was a great experience, the food was excellent with very original and creative combinations of flavors. The service was very kind and friendly. They get to know you and recommend things according to your tastes. It is one of the best places to eat if you want to experience new flavors and make some friends. breath taking!"
Trendy hideout with Taste,"I had heard so much about this hidden joint, and an opportunity came up for dinner with a friends so I jumped at it, and I wasn't disappointed. It was a busy night, and its a large space so the noise resonated through the space, however it created a great vibe, and lots of buzz and ambience. Some places can be dwarfed by all the noise but the vibe and energy really made this place a great dining venue. The food was absolutely delicious, with a selection of shared plates including dish of the night a slow cooked Lamb with Parsnip Puree and Masala dressing. So Yum! We will definitely be back!"
Camp Kilo Charcoal a MUST try,"Spent a very fun Saturday eve at Cam Kilo Charcoal Club! Samw place as original kilo restuarant but the ""BBQ/picnic"" version! Walked in to what seemed like a bbq at an unknown friends place! Veeeery casual dining - really dont even dress up!

Seating outside but loads of fans provide a breeze! People all around and you start feeling extremely hungry as soon as you see the first rack of ribs being served! Oh my soul! We had a feast of Ribs, chicken, fish, deliciously creamy potatoes, burnt yummy carrots, crispy brussel sprouts, creamy buttery corn! My favs were deffo the ribs and carrots! Let down was the corn bread!

I felt it was very affordable for a great bbq feast out with friends! Come dressed casually and ready to eat! Nothing posh abt it but what a treat! Will be going again this weekend!"
A nice change,"We really enjoyed our recent evening at Camp Kilo. A different location from the usual Sinagpore restaurants and a fun relaxing vibe, with a nice breeze from the riverside location. Very popular with families so if you want to avoid the anklebiters go a little bit later. Simple menu, great quality meat. The ribs were our favourite. Go with a group for a casual noisy evening."
Excellent food BUT extremely noisy,"I rated 4 my dinner experience because of the quality of food proposed, however the level of noise is a real nuisance.
First, food - delicious ! we went for sharing option and we tried: tuna wasabi, seared scallops, ceviche, beetroot salad (okela), squid ink rice (my favourite) and lamb. Honestly, all dishes were really good.
Only mistake was the desert - we chose the churros, and it was a bad choice - actually the grilled marshamalow which is served with the churros is far better.
Secondly, noise - a real problem. We were a table of 4, sitting along the window / riverside, and could hardly ear each other. This will clearly prevent me from going back.
Lastly, smoke coming from kitchen and smell. I generally really like the principle of open kitchen, but it was unfortunate that some smoke came from kitchen 2 or 3 times during the dinner. As a result we were really smelling like Korean barbecue when we came out - so don't plan to go on partying after dining at Kilo, unless it's in open area !"
