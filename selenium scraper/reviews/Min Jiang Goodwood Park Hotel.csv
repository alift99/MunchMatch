"Authentic Chinese food, great ambiance and service","This is our second visit to this restaurant whilst visiting SIN.

The food has been amazing and we have loved all types of dishes we have ordered. The waiting satff are always ready to provide you some recommendations depending on what time of the day you dine."
First timer,"Cantonese restaurant, food is pretty decent. As we were only have 3 person, didn't order the duck. We ordered pork, ribs, noddles, veg for a simple lunch. Desert is pretty nice. Service is good. Overall a good experience."
Food quality has dropped so much that you won’t want to go back again,"Food quality has really dropped. Eg The egg tart looks uncooked and could taste the floor, egg has sunken. XO carrot cake has no XO sauce taste. Skin of Xiao long Bao was too thick and dry. Overall food taste was not good. Service was bad. What a disappointment !"
Poor service and just OK duck,"I've been to Min Jiang several times, but this is the first time in 3 years. Service was way off, and duck was just OK. We ordered a full Peking duck. We are used to the usual presentation of the skin being rolled for us as the first course They just plopped it at the table and left. We had to summon a server (not easy to do) and asked her to roll it - she was put off, rude and complained it would take some time. Seriously poor service when paying this much $$$. The duck itself was just OK, not great as in prior times. Generally impossible to get a server's attention for more water or drinks.

Next time I will go elsewhere for my Peking duck fix."
Better value elsewhere,"It was raining and we were reluctant to get wet. We were staying at the hotel and ordered a take away meal from the restaurant because there is no in-room dining. Two servings, some rice and beer cost over $100. Dried chillies made up half of one serving and they had the mouthfeel and taste of heavy plastic with a slight hint of chilli. The other dish was an unimpressive serve of vegetables. What a waste of money!"
A shadow of its former self,"Been a regular at the branch in Dempsey and also occasionally at this main restaurant at Goodwood Park Hotel over the years, but regrettably the service standards have really fallen through the floor.

Eventhough they weren't particularly busy, the staff were really inattentive and calling out to (and gesturing) their colleagues at the other end of the restaurant - I did have to wonder whether we were dining at a hawker centre or 5-star hotel restaurant?

Food was OK (although be warned that their 'signature' Peking Duck is served in a totally different way to most other Peking Duck speciality restaurants, including their brand at Dempsey) but the overall ambience really spoiled the meal and when you're paying $400 for a meal, there are certainly restaurants which offer a much better experience at that price point! Definitely not going back......"
Worst dining experience ever in Singapore,"We pre-ordered Peking duck before our visit and other dishes upon arrival.

Took 30 mins with several reminders for them to serve our food. Peking duck is supposedly the signature yet they ran out of cabbage for the second serving of the dish (7 pm on weekday).

Appetiser did not come despite multiple reminders - eventually came after all other courses were served.

No apologies whatsoever. Not experience such inefficient service in Singapore, let alone an upscale restaurant.

Nothing special for the dishes nor Peking duck. Your bucks will go further elsewhere with a better dining experience."
Chinese,"A popular chinese restaurant for many years. Popped by for weekend lunch. Had dim sum as well as dishes like crispy chicken, lobster broth crispy rice and spinach. All good to very good. Service is ok, i wish they pretended to like their jobs more"
Great Dim Sum & Serene Atmosphere,"I was invited to lunch at this wonderful Chinese restaurant. The grandness & attention to detail is the 1st thing that caught my attention when i stepped in. Part of the restaurant also overlooks the pool which gives you that resort type of atmosphere.

Had Dim Sum that afternoon & the dishes were beautifully plated & tasty. I was most impressed by the fish soup & avocado coconut dessert which had an interesting twist to it.

Staff there are extremely warm & full of enthusiasm. Will be visiting this restaurant again for sure."
Standard has dropped; disappointing lunch,"Minjiang at Goodwood has been a stalwart favourite of my family for years, but the experience at the last couple of visits has been somewhat disappointing. To be fair, we had ignored it before and considered those as perhaps ""once off"" incidents, but this most recent experience really takes the cake.

When we arrived, there was nobody at the reception for nearly 10 minutes. The wait staff could see that a line was starting to form at the reception, but none of them acknowledged the presence of the waiting guests. Finally someone arrived to confirm the reservation, and subsequently left us waiting again for another 5-10 minutes. It would have been nice to at least even be informed that we needed to wait for the table, rather than leave us out cold. When we were led to the table, I was called by my first name, not a formal address with the surname, which was really not professional.

If we were off to a bad start, the food certainly did not redeem the rest of the experience. The first couple of dimsum dishes in the bamboo holder actually arrived cold, and we had to send them back. The rest of the food was ok but not great. When the dishes came, the wait staff did not state what each dish was; just plonked them on the table and walked away. The restaurant appeared short-handed, nobody was free to help pour the tea and we helped ourselves throughout most of the lunch. For dessert, we tried the christmas durian combo, which was nice except that it was rather frozen when it was served and we could barely cut the cakes with a knife, let alone a fork.

There are definitely other Chinese restaurants that I can count on to always serve piping hot food and provide much better service and overall experience. For a brand name like Minjiang, it can definitely do much better."
6-course curated meals at Min Jiang,"My wife and I had a great time eating our dinner at Min Jiang. Service again was five stars, and Eileen had been attentive to the needs and wants. Overall good and flavourful Chinese Cuisine."
Enjoyable dining experience,"We booked a dinner for 2 adults and 1 child at Min Jiang during our staycation at GWPH. It is pricey but the food quality was very good. I would like to compliment one of the staff, Keith, who is ever so helpful and engaging. Because of his recommendations, we went back for Dim Sum lunch the following day."
Great service & Michelle star cuisine,"My visit to min Jiang tonight was great after so many years , this restaurant will never fail me with their food & service, I am very impressed with the manager of the restaurant Elaine Goh, she always smiling, professional and very attentive to our dinning needs. Her team were excellent in serving us and suggesting menu and most importantly, go the extra miles to make sure our dinning experience is well taken care of.Special thanks & compliments to Kah lai, Debbie, hei mi and June for their hardwork & services.Their performance is an endorsement to the training & management of Goodwood park hotel led by General manager, Mr. Cheong hai Poh .
My compliments also goes to the chef for the excellent food , will highly recommend this restaurant to all and I will do it again for another meal with friends. Very happy and impressed guest

Excellent food and service!,"Served by Mr Keith lim, whom provided extraordinary service to take care of our needs :) even surprise us with a birthday bun! Will come back again most definitely!"
Delectable Dim Sum,"Simply fresh and delicious. The pastry was light and of the right complement to the fillings. Texture of the fried items was delicate and with the right crunch. Wide variety as well with several unique offerings, like the dim sum duo that can be sampled for dinner as well."
Elegant and popular,"This restaurant is bright and cheerful. Service and food is good. We tried a range of dim sum, and dishes. The homemade squid tofu with XO sauce and Land and Sea quartet were disappointing. Our favourites were the camphor duck, and fresh young coconut with avocado coffee dessert. The durian coconut dessert was served in a cute durian shaped ceramic container, but the durian fruit was frozen and of a disappointing quality."
Time for a change of chefs,"Was invited for a dim sum lunch. If I didn’t know I was at Min Jiang, I would have thought I was at Crystal Jade Kitchen. Well, the service is good, but the dishes extremely meh. No really bad dish, but no good one either - just very average. And poor value as a result, because it is much pricier than Crystal Jade Kitchen.

The Chinese restaurants at the Orchard Road hotels are at different levels, but virtually ALL of them (all except for the Orchard Rendezvous!) are better than Min Jiang: StRegis, Regent, Four Seasons, Marriott, Sheraton, Orchard, Mandarin Orchard, Grand Park."
Takeaway forgotten,"It’s for sure a great place for dinner, we went there for a family gathering for the Chinese New Year celebration. Food was good, ambience was pleasant, service was not too bad too. Just that my last item which was the shredded duck, requested for waitress to takeaway remaining but waitress didn’t not give it to me during bill. I only realised after driving off, oh wells busy night."
Despite recent poor reviews,"Despite recent poor reviews I still find the restaurant serving good food and service. Since there were only two of us, we ordered their specials...smoke duck with camphor tea, Kung pow prawns, stir fried string beans and Yang chow fried rice. All taste awesome. We had the durian pudding for dessert. Tasted nice, not too strong durian flavour. The alcohol were pricey for beer and wine. Ambience is nice and cosy. Service was both friendly and cheerful."
Chaos!!,"We went on the first day last week when they decided to change their menu due to chinese new year. It is common all restaurants do not have regular menu during festive season, prices would be hiked slightly so it is understandable. However, it seems the management changed it quite abruptly, including changing name of usual dishes when they were basically just things on the usual menu for the sake of auspicious. The poor waitress was very apologetic, telling us she couldn't figure out as there were a lot of new names etc on the first day and everything was chaotic.

We definitely missed out on the bacon prawn roll, as i have never in my life been to minjiang in the afternoons for dimsum, except for hosting clients for dinner there only. Items were marked up by abit on price, my mum has make a few comments on quality of food and services. Most importantly one of the waitress did not gave us tea with hot water when theg are charging us 9 dollar pax. It was only after we consume all our food and the 2nd tjme they change a pot, then the tea was coming of flavor. To be honest the place wasnt even packed, probably 8 tables on a weekend.

We like the momos as pictured, tasted a lot like a great western chicken pie delight but extremely expensive, if i remembered correctly we paid 12 dollars befofe taxes for that 3 pcs of momos. Camphor duck was ok, we couldnt taste the difference, especially when you are served hoisin sauce for it.

Then came the appetiziers which was a bak kwa (pork jerky). I thought it would have been a nice complimentary treat since it was chinese new year around the corner, or even if they charge it will either be lumped with the expensive tea cost or a normal pickle cost as we were not served any pickle or peanut before the meal. What audacity, it was 9 dollars mind you. And it tasted nothing like cardboard, shame on you guys.

What made things worst was, the waitress took our card first without even allowing us to check the bill before we offer our card for payment, which should and by all rights a consumer priority to confirm the bill is correct. I guess this was the reason so, as they want to mask up that 9 dollar charge on the pickle / bak kwa.

I am at a loss to say whether should we go back again or not, but probably is because of this chinese new year alteration that caused so much chaos and misunderstanding, but management do reflect what you should do when you change your menu abruptly and not train your staffs about it, and that pickle cost it is just too unacceptable."
Sad to see how far this restaurant has fallen,"For 10 years, Min Jiang was my favorite Chinese restaurant in Singapore. I went there once or twice a month with my kids, always went with out of town guests, all and all was a huge fan. Because of the pandemic, I did not go there for several months, and then made a booking on a Sunday recently for lunch. Big mistake. I am not sure if management has changed, or whether the financial pressure from the pandemic has forced management to change their program, but it was a bad experience. First of all, they have two seating on Sunday. We got there 5 minutes early, and joined a line of maybe 40 other people waiting. Because of their ludicrous check in system, it took 20-25 minutes for us to even get to the table. Then, because everybody was sitting down at the same time, and the fact that they are totally understaffed, with one waitress for 6 tables, we sat there for half an hour trying to get the waitress's attention to order. About an hour after we got in line, we finally managed to get an order in. Then, 15 minutes later, the waitress showed up to inform us that half of the items that we ordered were already sold out, including almost every yum cha item we wanted. When the food finally arrived, it was decent, but definitely not what I had been looking forward to, and the whole experience was terrible. This is not a cheap restaurant and for them to have such a terrible service offering is not acceptable. I won't be going back there again until they get their act together. Really sad to see, as for high end Szechuan, it was by far the best game in town."
Not sure if I will be back,First time here but I’m not sure if I would be back. I need my Chinese food served hot! The dim sum were served almost cold & the service we received at 5 star hotel were barely passable. We had to wait so long for our food. The food tasted pretty good but the service staff were so short handed that the food were already cold when it arrived. And we could barely get any attention from the service staff. Quite disappointed with my visit.
Fine Chinese Restaurant,"Included in our staycation package was a 5 course set dinner at Min Jiang. The place was newly renovated and just moved back to its original location of a long and narrow interior. The appetizers consist of 3 small items in a nice presentation. Taste was a little bland to us. Next came the hot and sour soup. Again it was a little bland with not enough hot neither sour. The deep fried sea perch was done perfectly though portion is small. The fried rice was wrapped in bamboo leaf and again is only a mouthful. The desert of chilled mango with sago and pomelo was super and saved the day. As it was our anniversary, they surprised us with a very nice piece of cake. Service was good though not excellent even though the place was not too busy."
Min Jiang Restaurant,"Great food . Staff was attentive and efficient . Would recommend the Black Pepper Beef Cubes and Peking Duck . Good value , though it may be on the pricey side ."
Great Peking duck,A Michelin star restaurant and deservedly so. The Peking duck is very good and so are most of their other dishes. Courteous and polite staff make for a good family experience.
Peking duck may be better in XinJiang than at MinJiang,"Conservative restaurant with no innovative dishes, but well-executed traditional ones, like Chinese spinach with eggs in broth or braised tofu in claypot. However, the Peking duck here is a disappointment. The skin is deliciously crispy, but it is served here without any meat (unlike at the much superior Imperial Treasures Super Peking Duck in Paragon) and is lost when wrapped in the pancake which is a tad too thick. The second dish (with noodles or fried rice) is extremely meh - no better than what you can find at Crystal Jade Kitchen. Except for the proactive fellow doing tea refills, service is quite slow. The ambience is homey and traditional, lacking class or any wow factor. All in all, a decent place, but not great value; there are many much better restaurants at this price level."
Safe bet for good Chinese Cuisine,"My wife and I brought our daughter to Min Jiang to celebrate her birthday. It was a no-brainer as we found the restaurant’s culinary standards to be rather consistent. Our daughter’s favourite was their crab meat fried rice so we had that as well as the Peking Duck, cooked two ways. We also had Broccoli with Scallops. The nicest touch of the evening was the complimentary longevity buns for the birthday girl!"
Definitely not Michelin standard,"As locals, we have been to Min Jiang Goodwood Park Hotel previously but this visit was the worst. Service was substandard and horrible. We didn’t mind the fact that we were seated outdoors as we did not make reservations. A total of 1 manager and 2 waitresses manned the outdoor seating of about 5 occupied tables. However, it was such a feat to get them to attend to us. The standard phrase: ”Please wait a moment.” was patronising after they kept repeating it for the umpteenth time and disappeared into the white doors leading to the inside of the restaurant.

Food was unimpressive and certainly not Michelin standard. The pan fried carrot cake tasted worse than those sold in food centres. The rest of the dim sum were mediocre. The century egg porridge was too salty for us. Our chicken porridge was served after we told them to cancel whatever was outstanding dishes that were not served. The time taken to get their attention was just excruciating. The time needed to get the bill was Michelin standard though.

Honestly, give this place a miss. I’d rather go to Taste Paradise at Ion (down the road) for dim sum."
"TERRIBLE service, mediocre food","Went there over the weekend. Anytime the staff didn't understand what we were asking for (which was quite often) they would say, ""Let me check"" and then go off and seemingly do other tasks! We had to keep chasing them for an answer! And then, I noticed that my glass had dried lipstick on it (no one at our table was wearing lipstick), I called the waitress who then looked at all of us and checked that it wasn't from someone at our table and then removed it. The manager did come by and apologize but I honestly feel this is pretty unacceptable in such a high-end restaurant.
Finally, the food itself didn't inspire me. Dim sum was fine but the main dishes really didn't stand out from other restaurants I've been to. In the end though, it was really the horrendous service that ruined the whole experience for me."
We2 Vegans fond of Chinese..,"For Vegans fond of Chinese... it is heavenly. Great food, superb service. Highly recommended. Highly recommended Lunch."
Great dim sum place,Enjoyed the spread of dim sum. Great service and attentive servers. Accessibility friendly restaurant. Limited parking lots during peak hours.
Real adventure,"Lots of new and interesting dishes for me. Our customer (who is local) ordered the complete meal, so everything was a surprise! Prawn dish best I’ve ever had."
strange dinner,"Nice food served. Upon arrival in the hotel, we decided to have dinner outside on the terrace. While eating, the staff started to remove all other tables as during the night, the cleaning team would come. A bit strange for such a quality restaurant not to wait till all the guest have left."
Good Quality Dim Sum,"It is a restaurant with a cozy, elegant atmosphere, very good for weekday lunch (there wont be much of a crowd). I recommend the bamboo clam dish (you can only get this if it's being ordered in by the restaurant, so it's considered a seasonal item. The other dim sum were very good quality as well."
Superb Vegetarian Menu,"3rd time back for more vegetarian dishes!

Favorite:
Black Pepper Tofu
Wawacai white asparagus
Claypot tofu skin

On our previous visit, our server had taken our order wrongly and she was very apologetic and friendly and served us the correct dish quickly.

3 times there and never disappoint!

Place is not very packed so it’s a good place to bring guests or for chatty family gatherings."
"Tasty, flavorful food!!","We had dinner here. The hot and sour veggue soup,sweet and sour fish( not in the menu but made it when we asked for it), fried prawns, fried rice were very good. The crispy noodles with veggies was a little bland but full of flavour. The star of the meal was the chicken chilly clay pot( we asked them to replace the sea food in the seafood chilly claypot with chicken) . It was delicious. Good , relatively fast service and ambiance. But the best part is their ability to tailor their dishes to your liking ."
Priced as a 1-star Michelin restaurant but does not deliver; surprisingly bad service; One North location is better,"I wish I could be more positive about Min Jiang at the Goodwood Park Hotel but I can't be. In January 2019 I ate at the Min Jiang branch at One North and it was certainly better. The problem seems to be with the staff at the hotel branch.

First some context. The hotel branch is in a convenient location, more so than the One North location. It is definitely a ""ladies who lunch"" sort of place. When I visited almost all the tables were occupied by ladies who lunch and who were evidently out for serious shopping. I also noted that very few of the customers were Chinese. The majority were Indian. I don't know if this was unusual or not. I'd say the following passage from Crazy Rich Asians gives one some idea of how the restaurant might be perceived in some quarters: “As Wye Mun and Peik Lin merged into the early-evening traffic on Dunearn Road, Wye Mun said, “Why don’t we invite Rachel and her boyfriend to dinner next week?” Peik Lin nodded. “Let’s take them somewhere classy, like Min Jiang.” (Kevin Kwan, “Crazy Rich Asians”.) So, dear reader, you decide - substandard for a Michelin one-star restaurant or ""somewhere classy"". My opinion follows.

Low pak ko (fried carrot cake): lukewarm, tasted like it had been sitting around and just been reheated; I sent it back and the second version, which took some time to come and had probably been cooked to order, was much better. Serving reheated, previously prepared food is not my idea of Michelin level cooking.

Prawn cheung fun: light delicate, light soy sauce, not glutinous, more delicate than often found elsewhere - good.

Siew mai : rather solid, dense and chewy; better elsewhere.

Steamed scallop & conpoy steamed dumpling: pleasant, not elevated.

Poached chicken and prawn dumpling in spicy sour sauce (chili oil and vinegar): chewy mouthfeel, nice taste, full flavor but not too spicy.

Tang bao/steamed crabmeat dumpling - large; served with a straw so one can suck out the soup that is inside the dumpling - an oversized kind of xiao long bao (Shanghai style soup dumpling); so big it broke apart and is almost impossible to eat properly; the flavor is too evanescent without the ginger vinegar.

Steamed bean curd skin with chicken & prawn: full rich flavor, lovely firm texture; one of the best I’ve eaten in many years.

Braised ee-fu noodles wth king prawn and XO sauce: vibrant ginger and sweet green onion flavors, firm prawn but no special taste, XO subtle to the point of being tasteless; noodles firm texture, nice taste.

Service: service was poor, certainly not at the level for a Michelin rated restaurant in a five star hotel; kitchen sent out reheated dish; I asked for dishes to be spaced out so they could be enjoyed properly and while still hot, but four dishes arrived at once; noodles arrived while still five dim dishes were still on the table despite the earlier, repeated request and when I said I had asked for the dishes to be brought slowly the response was “you have to talk to the chef”. To cap it all, at 2:30pm the lights went off and I was sitting in darkness, as were some other customers. I was told that the lights were automatically controlled by some place outside the restaurant and could not be turned on, which seems very unlikely.

My personal opinion is that there are many excellent Chinese restaurants in Singapore but this is not one of them. If you are determined to eat at a Min Jiang I suggest you go to the one at One North (which is a more attractive decor anyway). Otherwise I would advise anyone to choose another restaurant."
Good chinese cuisine at reasonable prices,"We celebrated a birthday dinner here. The restaurant was able to accommodate 14 diners at a single large table.

The food was quite good and tasty at a reasonable price (for a restaurant located at a top hotel).

Seems the restaurant will be moving to Dempsey soon."
Special lunchtime offer - get in quick !,"Just returned from an offer limited to a set menu lunch for only S$36 for TWO people, yes, TWO. That is less than an ordinary lunch in the not so salubrious Food Street. Impeccable service & decor, maybe they have noted previous reviews, with a selection of dim sum dishes plus an excellent mango dessert & bottomless pot of tea. Probably best to book as very busy today , mainly with savvy locals who can sniff out a bargain.,"
Good Chinese food.,"The Goodwood is a heritage hotel - one of the oldest in Singapore, and this is one of their 2 top notch restaurants. I found the interior rather narrow like a corridor but enjoyed our table outside beside the pool.
Like many Chinese restaurants in Singapore it has an extensive menu with a good choice of vegetarian options. Starters was deep fried Sichuan Onion pancakes which were surprisingly not 'oniony'. Main consisted of stir fried Asparagus with Honshimeji mushrooms which was cooked just with the right amount of bite and crispy noodles with mixed vegetables. Though full couldn't resist the Mango Sago with Pomelo for desert!"
"Funny, but not funny","Singapore service is hit and miss and this meal was definitely a miss. The service was terrible, a bunch of dishes were unavailable and I even heard a waitress tell a neighbouring table that they had run out of rice... at a Chinese restaurant!! You can’t make this stuff up!! Give this place a miss would be my advice."
Celebration dinner,"Hosting a birthday in the family, this restaurant is a favourite in our family. As Chinese New Year is in a couple of days one must try the Ye Shang. The smoked compor duck, Kung Pao chicken, string beans with meat, prosperity noodles, shredded chicken with mustard sauce, garlic pork with shredded cucumber were all great tasting and favourites. Price on the high end with the environment quite cosy. Service was good. Special gourmet tea are also served!"
Service is amazingly bad,The food was nice Chinese food. Nothing special. The service was the worst service I have encountered in a restaurant. Manager had serious attitude. And the poor girl serving us had no idea what was going on. So disappointed.
Very good quality food and service,This hotel is inside the Goodwood park hotel in Singapore. The food quality and services are all good. Could be slightly pricey but worth for the price overall
Vegetarian options. Good food and service but had to wait,"We went there for lunch on Sunday. We ordered vegan food. They had a vegetarian menu, and the waiter was very good in recommending vegan options. Food was generally very good. However, it appears that they were short-staffed, and we had to wait a long time for our tim sum."
Consistently good for decades,Yet another visit and yet another excellent meal coupled with courteous service makes a Singapore trip incomplete without a visit here..
Good food...nice ambience,"Happened to be here with friends after a long day. Soon after entering, stress of the day disappeared just because of the ambience. Once food was served, the presentation and aroma was great that we could think of nothing else."
Very nice but not exceptional,"Dinner booking made late so assume we were given a table outside on the terrace for that reason. Nice space overlooking hotel pool but this was a cool evening so probably inside table best if you can and better atmosphere. Service was only average ..waited long time for drinks and staff were not very knowledgable on dishes. Peking duck was very nice as were fresh XO prawns, pork belly small plate and onion pancakes (spring onions in a short pastry). 2 gins, water and one bottle of house white was around 350 Sing dollars so quite expensive for a very nice but not exceptionally meal and service."
Great Food!,Went here for a family dinner and had a really lovely time. The food was great. The portions were quite big and they had enough vegetarian food too. The staff was really nice. At one point we kept ordering and cancelling and ordering a dish but the lady didn't get annoyed at all (even though we were being annoying). They were so effecient too. The location is quite nice.
The best Chinese food I’ve ever had,"Were invited for by a local friend. Dim sum was delicious, amazing food and service. This place is a must if you enjoy fine dining."
AMAZING MENU,"Services and Food is good. The portion of the food is big and hearty. They are famous for their Duck - Tradition Peking Duck as well as their Wood Fire Beijing Duck and their signature Noodles and the Lettuces dishes. Their steam stuff is equally good so on the safe side, do orders more steam stuff from the menu.
Plenty of tables available as the restaurant is big so last minute booking or no reservation is okay.
Their dessert is mango. So, do try their mango."
Beautiful Restaurant,"The menu is overwhelming in size and variety and it made for a difficult choice. Everything we tried in Ming Jiang was top quality and absolutely delicious. The stem lettuce dish with shitake mushrooms was outstanding and was chosen at the last minute as an add on for some more greens. This was one of our most memorable dining experiences in Singapore and one I would like to repeat on my next visit. Portions were large, even the small dishes were far from small. My note for next time, is order less, order steamed prawns and the stem lettuce dish ."
Food To Die For,This is part of the Goodwood Park Hotel and serves the best Chinese food dishes in Singapore. Great service and ambiance.
"Excellent, as always","The really good thing about this restaurant is that it has maintained the quality of its' food over the years. I have never been disappointed. We just love the food here and return quite regularly.

For starters, the crispy peking duck and the hot and sour soup with crispy rice are both very good.

For the main course, the chicken with dry red chilli is very good but the pepper beef is simply outstanding.

Top it off with the mango pudding. Yummy."
I didn't know what I was ordering...but who cares?,"The menu was a bit of a minefield. I couldn't tell what I was ordering, how big it was or the total cost really. It is certainly well patronised by the locals which is very telling and a good sign. It was lovely food - I could have used a bit more direction on what the specialties actually were but the end result was bliss on a plate."
Excellent Chinese Cuisine,"Located in the Goodwood Park Hotel this restaurant serves excellent Chinese cuisine. Whilst some of the menu would sound familiar to people from England, there many dishes, which are different and more authentic Chinese. If you are in a party of 4, go for the whole Peking Duck part of which will be served with pancakes and the remainder with noodles making two excellent dishes. The staff are particularly helpful and engaging. Highly recommend."
Very good dinner,"We had a family dinner here and the food was top quality, delicious and the serving sizes good. We had a range of dishes including shark fin soup, seafood claypot, salted duck egg prawns, sautéed fish, spinach with shrimp and mushrooms. The table service was good and efficient. It did take some time for the food to arrive but the restaurant was full that night."
Delicious dim sum and wonderful service,"First time here and what a wonderful surprise. From the service and ambiance to the food, everything was a delight. We especially loved the dim sum - Xiao Long Bao, char siew puff, Ee fu noodles as well as the durian pudding."
Good quality!,"Good Chinese restaurant at the Goodwood Park Hotel. Not too big, kind and fast service, great quality. Everything at reasonable prices."
An old Favorite,"Been coming here for years but last night I was informed my favorite prawn dumplings with hot chilli oil were no longer on the menu
Well, apart from this major setback I would still recommend this very high class Chinese restaurant as my other favourite tea smoked duck pancakes are still available
We have always been able to get a table without a reservation as it's quite a large restaurant and the staff are very accommodating. As I said it's our favorite and also for some local friends."
Relaxing poolside dinner,Thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. Service was attentive. We sat outside and it was great sitting there having a good meal and nice wine. Would go again.
Daughters Birthday Party,Went with our whole family for dinner to celebrate my daughters birthday. The service was very slow. The Wine List did not come. We asked for the wine list. We ordered the wine and they took a long time ( about 40 mins) to bring the wine. We then asked for the menu. The Manager had no enthusiasm in her. We ordered a few dishes . The restaurant was half full and it took a long long time for each dish to arrive. The dishes were OK. A good service would have made the food taste better
Dining by the pool,"Nice relaxing ambience to sit and dine by the pool. Area is sheltered hence no worries about rain. Service is prompt, food portions are reasonable."
What a treat!,My host ordered one of weekend set lunch menu which was a real treat! The most memorable for me was the salted egg yolk prawns. It was most exquisite. The ambiance was what you can expect from Goodwood Park Hotel and the service impeccable.
Best Chinese in town,One of the best Chinese places that we visited during our business trip. The restaurant is packed with regulars. We wanted a taste of authentic Chinese and that’s what we got. Both the chicken and the vegetarian dishes were perfect. The service was very good and we got the orders at a regular pace.
Exceptional,"Joined for a wedding reception; they served suckling pig and Peking duck and it was absolutely sublime. The service was swift and the was executed very well. Every dish was quality and cooked perfectly. Would have no issues in recommending this place and would highly advise trying it out. Looking at the menu, its not cheap, but your going to be happy with what you have paid for!"
One among the best Sichuan restaurant,"On my frequent visit to Singapore, I have always make a duty to have a meal at Min Jiang.
Great atmosphere, very good authentic food.
The Peking Duck is a must.

I will be returning to Singapore and I have made a booking already for dinner.

This is a restaurant that bookings is essential.

Enjoy"
Undeniably awesome hospitality,"The service at Min Jiang is undeniably awesome! Friendly, warm, attentive hospitality constantly displayed throughout our 2 hours of lunch, up from the managerial level to the front line hospitality team. And don't get me started with the durian dessert...I can talk about its beautiful taste and wonderful texture all day long! The dim sums, too, were doing a great job in pampering our palate and satisfying our tummies :)

Thank You so much for this excellent experience that gave so much joy and comfort to me and my friends."
"High quality, reasonably priced dim sum","I ate lunch at this restaurant at the Goodwood Park Hotel while in Singapore during two stays on a recent trip to Europe. Fantastic quality, and the prices per pot were very good. Service was excellent and I didn't have to wait long to be served. I'd definitely go back."
Outstanding,"I must say I had one of the best Chinese dinners in Singapore The restaurant is classy but not that different from many others, what makes the difference is quality Shark fins soup, Peking duck, mango dessert... all delicious Will definitely come back"
High quality food with Very high pricing,I have found the food to be consistently of high quality. Plenty of options for the family - both vegetarian and otherwise. Their beef cubes are out of the world as are nearly all their vegetable dishes. Good service - but all this comes for price. Very expensive. Dont be surprised to get a bill of S$ 200 for a family of 2 adults and 2 young kids with an average appetite.
Excellent food. A little noisy,"Came here for dinner and had the dinner set - the duck starter very nice; everyone liked the bee hoon noodles. Have to admit the rest of the food was forgettable. Set had too much food. Shark fins soup so when one asks for a swap, the soup wasn't that good. Noisy for the price point"
Singapore's Culinary highlight!,"Min Jiang came as a recommendation from friends who used to live in Singapore. We couldn't be happier that we sought suggestions because the restaurant was wonderful.

Arrival was a bit shaky as there was no one at the reception when we arrived. We had to wait for I'd say about 2-3 minutes before someone came to usher us in.

The wait staff was incredibly polite and friendly. One of the diner in our party was allergic to shellfish and nuts. They have an incredible personable attention to his needs, including the chef someone out to ensure us that their food was prepared separately with zero cross contamination. What a lovely and reassuring gesture.

The erstwhile black pepper crab was every bit to its renown. Succulent and fresh and indeed just the right spicy. We without a doubt prefer black pepper over red chilli crab. Latter we find too sweet.

Beside the crab we ordered fish, chicken and shrimp appetisers and entrees. The Sichuan and Cantonese cuisines were delectable at fine restaurant, every morsel fresh and delicately presented.

We strongly recommend this award winning restaurant which is an outstanding choice for fine dining choose or any occasion."
Excellent cuisine,"It exceeded my general experience with Chinese restaurants. My favourite dish was the shrimp cooked in wine. The shrimps were very fresh, big, and crispy. They were cooked in wine prepared with the Chinese ingredient 'dongui' and herbs. The taste was phenomenal, I even drank the broth that came with it. Other dishes such as the beef spareribs, lemon chicken, and braised tofu were all above standard. I highly recommend this restaurant!"
Excellent food,"We decided to eat in the hotel due to being tired, what a good decision it proved to be. The food was excellent with the Peking duck an absolute highlight.

Service was extremely efficient and friendly and we received great recommendations on what and how much to order.

Well worth a visit"
Fabulous duck!,Been to this restaurant before and loved it - best Peking Duck! Great ambience but sadly this time we were served by a trainee. No towels at the start or finish of dinner and it took an age for her to make up the pancakes so cool to cold and not well wrapped so tended to fall to pieces as we tried to eat them. We realise that staff do need training but would prefer it wasn't when we have come from Australia and booked a table well in advance. The flavour was still delicious and the lychee desert was a world beater - a fresh gourmet delight.
Consistently good value dim sum and Schezuan cuisine,You can rely on the consistent quality of food and service. An outstanding place to take guests. Highly recommend the restaurant. Accessible for wheelchair if you enter from the 'back' car park
amazing dim sum,"Our host took us for lunch to this restaurant within the hotel, Every aspect of the visit was 1st class, the service, quality of the food and regular top ups of tea. A real treat."
"Great food, good service & great ambience",My overseas friends enjoyed the food very much. Much neglected great restaurant. Try the smoked duck and Mongolian Chicken. 👍
Food is good..,"The food is good, especially their Crispy Duck smoked in Camphor Tea and Steamed rice with preserved Chinese sausages wrapped in lotus leaf. Went on a weekday evening and it was crowded. There were still many guests coming in after 9:30pm and the alfresco area was quite packed. Will return to dine at this place.

Room for improvements:
The flooring is sometimes quite distracting as when someone walks past, you can feel their movement, plus small walkways. In addition the serving time of the food is not well coordinated as some dishes took quite a long while to come, so some dish that were on our table became cold... In addition, the service have plenty of room for improvements. It was difficult to get hold of a staff, probably understaffed, so we ended up taking things for ourselves as we gave up waiting."
Sichuan,"One of the best for Kung Pao Chicken, String beans with chicken, Xiao Long Pao, smoked duck, and many others! A Favourite for Singaporeans for a Long time. Book early or you will not get a table!"
Food is pretty good,...but the customers can be really annoying. The service is all it can be under those circumstances.
Old Favorite in Singapore,"We Went with high expectations and also informed our friends for whom it was first time.
Fantastic Food.
Higher than expected taste.
Very good service also just make sure you are good two hours plus away from closing time and every thing will be hunky dory.
Main selection was Vegetarian and each dish was better than the other.
We loved Crispy rice with Hot and Sour Soup but then also loved
Onion pan cake so much that we ordered next portion.
Mock chicken with black bean sauce was amazing so much so that my wife wanted to know the supplier to them.
Should not miss their Tofu and also Peking Duck - all vegetarian.
Truly five stars.
Go with high expectations I am sure you will love it too.
PS: please do indicate you need food without Ajino Moto."
"Great food, good services, beautiful dim sum at the pool","The set up is in a beautiful colonial hotel, restaurant is half inside and half al fresco. The outdoor part is way nicer for a brunch. Service was spot on, and the waitress was kind enough to remind me which dishes might include meat after we explained to her I am pescatarian (this is not usually the case in Singapore I realise so usually one has to ask for every single dish). Food was really good, authentic, fresh, super tasty, yet not indulged on condiment or salt. Highly recommend."
Pleasant afternoon lunch with friends,"We had just arrived back from our four day cruise and wanted to have good Chinese lunch before catching our flight back to Dubai. My wife and I were staying close to this lovely hotel so chose Min Jiang which was rated highly. So five of us agreed to meet at 1.30 pm directly at the restaurant. There is seating inside and outside ( facing the swimming pool ). However we chose to be indoors. We ordered quickly from the menu as their last orders were at 2 pm. I was impressed that the server who took our order didn't have to write down any of our choices ! She must have an amazing memory. She got it all right of course. The food started arriving without a long wait and I must say that everything tasted wonderful. Our friends were also pleased and it turned out to be a lovely afternoon, well spent. After lunch we sat outside for an hour, enjoying the relatively pleasant temperature and green surroundings. Would happily go back again."
Great Chinese food,This place is not cheap but you get what you pay for. Perhaps the best Chinese food we've ever had. Very fresh seafood and vegetables. The prawn and pork fried rice was excellent. Had the mango dessert and it was enjoyable. You can dine inside with AC or outside by the pool like we did
Great food !!!,The Ming Jiang is one of the top choices if you are looking for great chinese food. One of the highlights is definetley the hot and sour soup and one of the best you can get in Singapore.
"Great food, reasonably priced",I was there on Christmas Eve and had the set dinner. The food was simply delicious. Each item complimented each other very well.
"Great food, less great service","Cards on the table, I really like the food here - their Lobster Szechuan hot pot rocks and we've had very few bad dishes across a wide range of options over the years but.... it's always been pricey and now it's getting silly - the lobster dish we love used to be charged at a fixed rate for small medium or large but now it's per 100g and unless you're careful, your waitress will decide how much you need - Sgd135 of lobster later..... the wine list is decent but at the higher end price wise for Singapore and sadly the service tonight was pretty sloppy, not bringing dishes together, trying to clear tables when we're not finished, trying to serve wine but not watching when we're empty (would much rather a bucket on the table and we serve ourselves!!)... still like the atmos of the outside tables and will go again but Imperial Treasure in Paragon is better value for money...."
Superb,"Min Jiang came to me very highly recommended and it did not disappoint on any aspect. This is authentic Asian dining at its best.

Seating is available inside or out which is always a choice I appreciate and we were seated straight away even with the restaurant close to capacity.

The Xiao Long Bao are some of the finest I have had anywhere in Asia. We ordered a selection of main dishes to share and all were excellent."
Food on the expensive side not matching quality.,"Min Jiang Restaurant has been around since 1982. I can still recall the time when they had their outlet across the road where the Spa is now situated. In those days, we enjoyed their selection of Sichuan and Cantonese dishes, particularly their Chicken diced with Dried Chilies; Long beans with minced meat; their Mango pudding and Pancake dessert; etc.

We returned to dine at this restaurant and I was surprised to see that they’ve moved into the Goodwood Park Hotel. The entrance is small and unimpressive, dining tables lined in a long tight row inside, but in a more spacious arrangement outside at the verandah next to the Hotel’s main swimming pool. The outdoor space is cooled by ceiling fans, whilst inside, it’s air conditioned. There are six private dining rooms.
Service was initially attentive and polite, although several times when I wanted some attention, I found no waitresses visible, possibly they were busy serving elsewhere.

We ordered the famed Peking Duck done in two styles; the Ham and Melon soup; The Marble Goby; the Abalone with Tofu; and the Noodles with Lobster. The first dish to come was the complimentary birthday buns. Small, but adequate in size so as not to fill you up. The Peking Duck was served all wrapped neatly in wheat wraps. This was tasty especially with the plum sauce, and with the spring onion shoots giving it a crunch. The Ham and Melon soup was delicious with a hint of stock aroma. The Goby fish had a meat that was sweet and slightly crunchy, but it also had lots of bones; the Abalone with Tofu was disappointing as the abalone meat ( a sliced piece ) was tough and the tofu unremarkable. When the Duck returned, the meat was minced and fried. This was to be placed on and eaten with lettuce leaves. We found the meat too dry and saltish. The Noodles and Lobster was just alright, meaning there was no Wow! factor. Served with a well-flavoured stock, a small portion of noodles and perhaps two to three mouths full of lobster meat.

Average cost per person for this meal without wine was $70.00. It’s certainly not cheap to dine here as almost every item is chargeable as ‘per portion’. Consider the Marble Goby, served about 100 grams in a small cup costing $20.00 per cup; or the Noodles with Lobster (actually half a small lobster) at $26.00 a portion. Neither of the above two ‘portions’ will fill you up. We brought a magnum bottle of red wine and there was no corkage charge. Being inside a five star hotel, I suppose the charges need to be classy as well, but their standards I feel, need some catching up!

Fantastic Peking Duck,"This restaurant offers one of the best Peking Duck in Singapore. The skin is very crisp and the meat they serve afterwards, the buns and crepes are very crisp. The food is always good and I have been there for many years and go back every time I visit Singapore. A lot of space and ideal with families and large parties."
So so tasty,A great variety of Asian food all cooked to perfection with service to match. A warm Singapore night sitting outside by the pool a Gin and tonic and some sumptuous selections that tickle your taste buds. I'm sure you get the picture.
A quiet break from the midday hustle of Singapore,"Try a terrace lunch to escape from the Singaporean aggresive AirCon. Take care when ordering as the portions are large, rather just try two main dishes and their rice. If you are feeling extra hungry their house Singapore noodles are excellent.

As with most upmarket hotels, neither food nor drinks are cheap by Western standards."
Great food and service,The food and service were great but despite all the other reviews the only disappointing thing was the Peking Duck!
"Good food, Good service & Good environment","Have a very good experience dining in the restaurant. The food is delicious and the service provided by the restaurant manager, Moon is very good. Will definitely visit again."
Fantastic Meal,I visited Min Jiang with my family last week and had a wonderful time. The peking duck was great and so were the other Sze Chuan dishes we tried. The service provided by Moon was attentive and made us feel very comfortable. She was very accommodating to our requests as well. We will definitely visit the restaurant again!
Excellent Service and Foods,"I would like to express our amazing experience when I was served by Restaurant Manager, named Moon Ng on the 30th September.

I was visiting this restaurant with my family. This was our first experience with this restaurant. Highly recommended Peking Duck, crisp and perfectly matched with traditional crepes. Moon has made us feel comfortable and welcomed during our time there.

We had such a brilliant evening and I am really looking forward to being served by her again in the near future."
Good food & great service,"Good food.. Try the peking duck, sharks fin soup with crabmeat, and the avocado cream with ice cream in whole coconut.. Friendly service by Ms Moon and Ms Beckie.. Good ambience.."
Excellent service and delicious food.,"I went there with my family and we ordered few dishes,the dishes were very delicious especially the pecking duck. In the same time,we were served by the restaurant manager name ""moon"" if I'm not mistaken,she provided excellent services like we were having dinner in our own house. Thanks for the delicious food and great services."
