delicious food,"great location near our hotel, usual standard you expect from Hard rocks, steak was amazing. good value."
Good food,"Nice setup, good food and value for money. Many choices on food selection too. Good place for family, friends gathering etc."
Dinner with friends,1st time to visit with my friends to celebrate advance christmas but unfortunately the service was terrible. It’s like the crew not attentive to the customer. The food is good considering it’s hard rock cafe and the price only the service not good.
not as expected,"Very limited menu, place rundown. Food was ok. I had salmon, my husband burger. Toilet not very clean."
Ridiculously small patty of a double mushroom swiss,"The service is mediocre and the food is down right unacceptable. I ordered a mushroom swiss double patty and the patty is so small. You can see my photos as evidence. Its so ridiculous especially for a chain priding itself as an American food chain. Not to mention its rather pricey at sgd 35 bucks... I rather eat at shake shack or five guys with chain to spare. Heck I even save up for a trip to the usa and just dine at cheesecake factory. The server is outrightly rude, when I asked about the portion he just replied ""its like that. Thats a smash patty"". Seriously... Ridiculous.... I heading to Mac Donald's for a proper meal after this at 1/8 the price."
Worst Hard Rock Cafe!,"Booked in advance and included a note about it being a special occasion for one person and so asking for a nice table, but on arrival the server didn’t act on the information in any way but did awkwardly mentioned that it was a special occasion, which was just weird. The table was in a dark corner and dirty! We also felt really pressured to leave when there was still a while before closing time. The food was good, but not a good experience overall."
Poorly maintained,"Paper towels were spilling out of the bin in the ladies’ toilet. Lock broken, some toilets stained. Looked like it hasn’t been cleaned since it opened for the day."
Another Birthday Dinner,"We have had all our birthday dinners here at HRC, right from the grand parents to the youngest in the family. We have always enjoyed the atmosphere, the staff and the food obviously. A change in the menu this time and they removed our fav jumbo combo platter to start with. Overall it was another awesome visit."
Memorable birthday meal with first-rate service,We made the right choice to celebrate a friend's birthday at Hard Rock Cafe Orchard. Our wholesome set lunch was complemented with excellent service and nice music. The friendly staff sprang a fun surprise on the birthday girl and lent their vocals to the event. We felt so pampered. Thank you so much to the general manager Mr Mark Chan and his capable team.
Best service and amazing food!,Amazing service as usual! Highly recommend getting the ribs. Definitely one of my favourite places to go to for a night out.
WOW!! Best hard rock visit in ages!!,"All I can say is wow wow wow. This cafe was one of the best hard rocks we have visited. From start to finish the staff were friendly and attentive, made sure we were well looked after following a poor visit to the Copenhagen cafe. We were greeted by 2 managers Lisha and Mark, who were so lovely and took the time to chat to us during our visit.
The servers were amazing and recommended various dishes including the brownie which was amazing!!!
Food was outstanding at this cafe and cooked to absolute perfection.
Honestly one of our best ever experiences at a Hard Rock Cafe, just wish it was closer to our home country so we can go back again haha!"
Excellent Value for Set Lunch,"I brought 8 colleagues to HRC for set lunch after trying it out a few months' ago. Again, it didn't disappoint. The baby ribs were good and portioning was just right. Service was good too, on both occasions."
Always enjoy my experience with Hard Rock Cafe,Looking forward to lunch with my friends and colleagues with Hard Rock Cafe for their Lunch promo. Two thumbs up for their set lunch.
Hard Rock Cafe,The last time I visited was back when I was 21! Daughter wanted to dine at Hard Rock as it shall be her first! We enjoyed the ambience and starter was good and enough to fill the 3 of us! My girl had Mac and cheese which tasted on the bland side. My tortillas’s chicken was not too great. I prefer slightly heavier on the spices taste. Overall the place still looks clean and neat! Nice to be back.
Very bad service by one Jonnie ruined our dining and evening,"Went into this cafe during a lean time with most tables empty and nothing going on. The waiter for our table Mr. Jonnie took time to present himself and seemed to be in a hurry for us to order. Very unlike HardRock cafe service where even in NYC with all the rush hostesses wait at our table and help us order. Anyways, we were given plates with forks on the table - just left in one corner for us to take ourselves, he went away. Food was served by some other waiter. All I wanted in my whole dining was one tablespoon and extra side of Guac to order. But Mr. Jonnie kept us waiting as he was mostly talking and serving a table nearby. When he did get free and I waved to him, he shouted from three tables away something and went away. Some other waitress then came that way and we got our spoon and guac after a wait of 15 mins. When Jonnie came that way to say ""last order for 1-1 happy hour or something"" as he seemed to be in a rush again, I asked him politely what did he tell me from three tables away. He said ""nothing"" and simply left without even talking to me as I was saying something. I had to complain to his duty manager who apologized for him. Clearly his behavior was discriminatory against our table of foreigners is what all three of us (of different nationalities) felt. We left without ordering more drinks and food that we wanted to. Anyways, service at HardRock cafe in Singapore isn't the same as in other places (I have dined at dozens in my travel all around the world). Won't patronize this place again."
Good food and service in the Orchard Road area,"We enjoyed the $16 nett set lunch at Hard Rock Cafe Orchard. There were plenty of choices for the main course. We found the soup of the day (tomato soup), fish and chips and sambal sea bass delicious. The iced tea was generous too. And there was even ice-cream in the set meal. The female and male staff were relaxed and made us feel at home in the cafe. Its slightly off-grid location in the Orchard Road area actually turns out to be a plus point - away from the frazzled pace of the city, yet accessible enough."
Hardrock Cafe,I really enjoyed to eat my meals with my friend they serve me good as a customer the food are good taste
Great place for lunch,Repeated visit. Came here with family and friend on different occasions. Nice food. Will patronise again.
Rocking Good Place,"The music is back so that makes up for the atmosphere a bit. Food portions is large as always and staff, though a tinge demoralised is still friendly and lively"
good value,"Had the set lunch at SGD16 nett - fish and chips. Pleasantly surprised the portions were just right, not too little (or much). Fish was seabass, was of good texture, the batter was crispy.
The add-ons e.g. Americano, was affordably priced. Service was prompt."
Lunch,Excellent value for money set lunch . Our family had a good time and highly recommend this place for good food and nice ambience
New year count down 2022,"The staffs are fantastic, they tried to lift up the mood, and of coz the portion was very big for us"
Staff,"We had so much difficulty communicating our order of drinks with the staff. Made mistakes and overcharged us.
Thankfully 1 staff who served us was pleasant and tried to provide good service."
Yummy tasty food great for families,"Thankful for the helpful staff that serve our table and being patience with our orders. Love the time spent there as a family, feels exclusive and spacious. Food Portion is great too"
Hard Rock Orchard,First time visiting HR Orchard and it was great. I have been to the Sentosa one which I really enjoy many times and I must say the Orchard one didn't disappoint. I found the food and the staff just as great and an added bonus was seeing Mark the GM who I know well from Sentosa. Great job guys. Keep up the excellent and friendly service.
Great experience,Michella the hostess accommodated our family of 5 without a reservation which we greatly appreciate! Friendly floor staff! Had a great time! 5 star service! Definitely be back!
Excellent Service - Hard Rock Cafe Sentosa,"We had a beautiful and delightful dinner experience @ Hard Rock Cafe, Sentosa. My family had such a wonderful time not just of the unique recipes, most important is the friendly and heart warming service crew. Kudos to Sashi and Charlene! Both of them made us feel at home and had much laughter over the dinner. Hard Rock Cafe Sentosa, you truly have an amazing duo. Will definitely return : ) Sashi & Charlene, thank you for your service."
Good lunch deal,"The set lunch is $16 NETT; very good value. I am so glad they brought this deal back - drink, soup, main and dessert."
HRC as a family or business restaurant,"I have always enjoyed meeting up with my colleagues n friends for lunch at Hard Rock Cafe during the pandemic as it’s located nearby our residence where we are now working from home. HRC offers the best value in town in terms of food quality, ambiance, service n pricing. I also appreciate its high hygiene standard as a restaurant."
great,team was awesome and accommodating. and arrange nice table for my family. and a surprise sundae for the birthday girl. nice family time. Just that the beef was slightly char.
Enjoyable dinner,"The staffs are very friendly and helpful.I’m so happy that I’m able to enjoy the festive food menu on my birthday month.Overall, the dinner is amazing with the delicious food!"
Same great food & service,"The food and service was excellent. The Ribeye + Baby Back ribs are good. The sides' servings could have been improved with bigger portions.. Good to get the above 2, and used as sharing."
Come for LUNCH! (Weekday),"Haven’t stepped in here for ages, so thought will give it a chance, as well as an opportunity to reminisce.

We had the set lunches, of which we were suitably impressed. Each comes with a good beverage, a delicious soup, a good-sized main course (i had BBQ baby pork ribs and it tastes the same as that in overseas branches!), and a large scoop of Häagen-Dazs ice cream.

Each set costs $16 nett - it’s truly nett. What a delightful affordable lunch in the city (ok, almost “in” the city)!"
"Friendly staff, good food",HRC without the music need not be dead. The staff and food made up for the missing element. Always feel at home at HRC
Burger lunch!,Went for a Sunday lunch of burgers; place was pretty much empty due to Covid limitation of 2 pax for dine in. Burgers were delicious :)
Lunch at hard rock cafe,"It was a casual lunch, I went with my husband. The Amex entertainer has 1 fo1 main course. I order the original burger & the fish & chip. Both were good . On the way out, the waiter recommended the set lunch deal which was available on weekdays only. The set seem value for money so we will be back to try the set lunch."
Cosy family dining place,"Enjoyed the atmosphere as always since 1990. Just unfortunate that they no longer serve salsa sauce with the nachos. It had been so for the past 8 years. Hope the good old salsa sauce will be reintroduced in this family restaurant! Portions are large, sharing would be ideal to taste the gamut of choices."
Good Service,Staff was really kind and making us felt welcome while dining. The lunch set menu is a to go for as it is cheap and good.
Good Food @ Hard Rock!,"Great Food!
Baby Back Ribs and Impossible Burgers were good!
Classic Nachos always a favourite.
Famous Fajitas are fun to wrap!
Weekday Happy Hour Rocks!"
Vaccinated American denied entry to American Restaurant. Do not eat here!,"As an American businessman, I travel often, COVID making the travel experience all the more challenging. To this traveler, the international Hard Rock Cafes have served as mini homecomings seeking the taste and sounds of home.
Not this time. Not in Singapore!

The Singapore government mandate requires proof of vaccination beyond presenting your vaccination card. Vaccination verification by way of a serology (blood) test is mandatory to authenticate your vaccination. A government issued tracking app (TraceTogether), facilitates your mobility. While this went against my principles,I complied.

Compliance, whether at the public or private level, may only be enforced when the tools to support compliance are available. As my TraceTogether vaccine status remains pending, (10 days and counting), I carry all the current documents the app references in order to enter restaurants. These documents have allowed me to dine in at every other restaurant I have patronized in Singapore.

Upon approaching the Hard Rock Cafe’s management, I was rebuffed. Given my Tracetogether app “Pending” status, my documents and entry were incredulously denied.

Logic and flexibility trump dogmatic, uncompromising and doltish rebuffs in this plight against COVID. Sadly, the Hard Rock has lost a very loyal patron.

If you are looking for the taste and feel of home, the premise onto which the Hard Rock was built, you won’t find it here."
For 1-For-1 Main Dish,"My ex-colleague and me liked to visit this restaurant next to Forum Shopping Centre, which is the iconic Hard Rock Cafe, situated in HPL House along Cuscaden Road. We headed down to this cafe for a rockin' good time and ordered up their Baby Back Ribs for tender ribs seasoned with their signature spice blend and house-made barbecue sauce."
Great and friendly staffs. Food portion is huge.,The service crew were very polite and friendly and check on us to see if we are okay with the foods. They also prepare an icecream for my partner birthday and the atmosphere was very relaxing.
Hard rock (Orchard Singapore) does not rock,"One of the service staff, his name “Banana” (as confirmed by another service staff) was extremely rude. He threatened to split my family up as he accused us of mingling with our kids (we had to be seated 2 by 2 given the Singapore Covid measures) even though we did not even stand up or go over to their table. We merely spoke with them seated where we were. We didn’t even lean towards them etc. we just spoke seated exactly where we were at our own tables. He had double standards because subsequently he was taking photos for another family that were seated across 2 tables, Mum on one table and the father and child on another. He spoke with them for a prolonged period (he was mingling himself!!!) and took their photos across both tables for a prolonged period too and they were speaking to each other across tables on the photos takened! Isn’t that mingling per his standards ? The other staff were pleasant and in fact I think embarrassed by him. He shouted across the restaurant to one of his colleagues over a particular matter and in our opinion that was quite rude too.
Also, the memorabilia in Hard Rock were old and very few. We can also understand that a live band is not allowed due to Covid however NO music at all in Hard Rock is totally unacceptable right!! There was no music at all and the entire experience was seriously very underwhelming. Honestly it’s highly unlikely we will visit again. My kids were excited cause they recently started playing the electric guitar but we were all extremely disappointed."
Good!,"Always enjoy going back to Hard Rock Cafe for causal dinner, or celebrations. Before the COVID, I make it a point to go back to HRC at least once a year for my birthday celebrations. Food, drinks and ambience were good. However, it will be better with live band performances and MTVs. Always watching from the big TV screen."
"Amazing, as usual","We enjoyed the mother's day promotion and it was a great deal! As usual, we enjoyed the food and the servings are huge. We shared 2 mains between 2 adults and 1 child. The ribs are a must-try!!!"
Enjoyable lunch,"We had a fantastic time at Hard Rock catchng up and nice food.
We arrived much earlier than our booking and were glad we are able to still have a table.
Thanks Hard Rock for a nice brithday ice cream surprise.
We will be back again!"
Food is not nice,We ordered burger and cowboy ribeye. The hamburger patty was not seasoned at all and so it was pretty tasteless. The steak came as medium rare which was what we have ordered. However the steak was full of tendons that my jaw felt sore after eating. We also bit into tiny fragments of bones and fortunately didnt chip my teeth. We totally didn’t expect Hard Rock Cafe to produce such low quality food.
Awesome,"The burgers are delicious, love the chicken wings, nice cocktails, and super friendly and cute staffs."
Awesome Celebration,Was there with my family to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we had an awesome time. Great food and service. Thank you for the complimentary sundae.
Hard Rock Cafe,Food good value for money. Service was also good and fast. lunch set menu has a decent variety but portions are smaller.
No longer that Rocking anymore,"This outlet at Orchard is practically an institution. But like all legends, it is starting to show its age and this one seems to have crashed and burned. From the main road you cannot even tell that the place exist.

The whole situation is not helped by this is the first time that we have visited a Hard Rock Cafe that lacks any warm or friendly atmosphere. The guy at showed us to our seat was totally unfriendly, just rushed to get us to our seat and then returned to his station. It is not like there was a queue or crowd at the time too.

But was quite surprised to see him missing from his post at the end of our meal to send us off. So kind of makes you wonder what is his role at the restaurant. The front counter service has really taken a nose dive.

Thanks to him, did not even bothered to stop at the HRC shop at the end of the meal, which we will normally drop in to buy a few items to remember our experience but this time round would prefer save the cash to forget ever come in.

Thank goodness, the serving crew is still somewhat friendly. However, of the 2-3 crew that serviced our table. Only one was truly a joy to be with, making effort to chat and joke with us (too bad did not manage to catch her name, as she was a true gem that evening).

The food like all HRC is about the same. So there is nothing to shout about. But nobody really comes to HRC for its food, it is the personalized services that makes dining in special.

Another major downside is that the deco has really gone downhill, there is a lack of rock memorabilia or good rock or pop music playing at the background. Everything is just so sterile.

Hope to see the place regain some of it old magic. If not, it would just be just another theme restaurant outlet forgotten with the passing of time."
Great food & service,The service is excellent n food is great! We will definitely return again n to add on HRC Orchard brought back many beautiful memories for me during the 90s
Happy dining experience,Enjoy the dining atmosphere and have a wonderful birthday lunch celebration at the restaurant. The staffs are friendly and helpful. Keep up the good work!
Set lunch,The set lunch is a good deal & staff at HRC is friendly & helpful . Go try it yourself before it's over!
Kudos to the service crews!,We are group of 8 and we are warmly welcomed. The amount for each serving is very huge. Initially we ordered 2 nachos- but the crew recommended that we should try ordering 1 serving first- and true enough its good for a big group. Kudos to the service of the crews especially Chai who always check on us and ensure that we are having a great time.
No longer the Hardrock I used to know,Overpriced food. Taste horrible. Paid 55 for a steak that is thin and over charred. Asked for medium rare ended up with hard over cooked meat. Nachos came soggy and tasted rancid.
Dinner for nostalgia,"Came here with a reservation on Chope for CNY Eve dinner with mom, who requested Hard Rock Cafe for nostalgia. We were running a little late, but the hosts held our table all the same, and it was marvellous to be greeted with such warmth when we stepped in from the pouring rain.

They had a festive menu for Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day 2021, which was very tempting, but in the end we reverted to the main menu and ordered the Hurricane and Long Island Iced Tea cocktails, and the Legendary burgers (Original and Barbecue Bacon Cheese) because Mom was there to relive her youth after all.

The first round of drinks and the food came out pretty fast, the second drink took a bit longer as it was getting busy, but it was a reasonable wait.

The food portions were generous, and the done-ness of the meat was spot-on (some places give you medium well when you ask for medium). With so many cafes and restaurants offering quality burgers now, this isn't necessarily the best burger I've had, so at about $30 a pop, it is on the steeper side.

For me, what made the experience worth the bill we paid, was the service we experienced. Hard Rock Cafe is an institution, and people come not only for the food and drinks but also the vibe. And every single one of the waitresses who served us that evening, or spoke with us, managed to make us feel like a rock star. They were friendly from welcoming us to waving us out the door, patient in answering our questions and taking our order, and obliging in all our requests without making us feel like we were being a hassle at all. This is gold star service standard.

Covid regulations dampened the atmosphere, by no fault of the establishment. We look forward to an eventual return to normalcy so HRC can have their live sessions again."
Burger dinner,"Craving for a hearty burger, my wife and I headed to Hard Rock Cafe for their Legendary Burger. To avoid the crowd, we arrived early for dinner. There was just 3 occupied tables when we stepped into the restaurant. More customers arrived over the course of our dinner.

We enjoyed the Legendary Burger and the thick chips that came with it. With the Black Angus beef patty medium-grilled, the burger was flavourful and satisfying. With so many places offering burgers, the Legendary Burger at Hard Rock Cafe is one of our favourite. We also shared an order of One Night in Bangkok Spicy Shrimps.

Service by staff Yong was good."
good flavor and volume,"I love burgers from Hard Rock Cafe. As we started our lunch meeting at 11:30, we were the only customers in the restaurant. Maybe, it was not a busy day. Pretty quiet and everything went pretty smooth. Oh, just one thing... it is a little hard to catch waiter/waitress's attention... I guess that it is normal in Singapore..."
Cuscaden,We ordered the except same food from menu as we did at Hard Rock Cafe Sentosa weeks ago. The famous ribs was not as tender & juicy as the one we had at Sentosa.
Staffs weren’t too detail,Food is great but the staffs don’t really take note of reservation request. Eg. I ask to be given window seat but this wasn’t taken care of. Then came payment even I reserved using the mask promo code I still had to remind the staff before given one.
Bad service,Went to cuscaden outlet on 30/01/2021. Promised to give complementary to birthday girl but failed. Asked staff Chai to check but insisted to say “NO”. Failed to check!! Failed and disappointed the birthday girl.
Lost its purpose,"There was a time when the entrance was more spectacular (american car front on the wall), when the restaurant was playing good rock music and when the atmosphere was warmer. In reality, as soon as we sat we wanted to leave.. Food is ok and portion are good but there is no special atmosphere, just a very normal restaurant. It was particularly cold as all the aircons including those upstairs were on (even though upstairs floor was closed). Really not nice. Then all the TV screens, supposed to play music or live concert, were just showing advertising of Hard Rock Cafe such as ""Book with Us"" and get $10 voucher or ""Organize your Birthday party at Hard Rock Cafe""!
This is just bad marketing in fact."
Appreciation,"Dear Manager Lisha and Team,
We are very thankful of your excellent service.
Manager Lisha and the counter staff/cashier are very Kind, accommodating and humble.
The menus are super delicious and affordable. Taste good. The ambiance is clean and cozy with nice music, very relaxing. We enjoyed our dinner in your restaurant. Looking forward to visit again with my friends. Appreciate you all. We’ll recommend this place to my other friends.
Thank you and Happy New Year everyone!❤️"
Feedback,"Dear Nisha & team at Hard Rock Orchard, Thank you for accommodating. Food is so good too. Happy New Year to all of you.Blessed year ahead.♥️"
Lost Hard Rock charm,"Dining experience was just like other typical eatery, very mellow. No hard rock charm, music was subtle, overshadowed by diners chatting away... Miss the old Hard Rock experience. Especially this pandemic where we are unable to travel to other Hard Rock cafes around the world, it will be a great change to escape from this mundane. Sadly we can't... Hopefully this will change because we love Hard Rock."
Great Deal Set Lunch,"We took the S$15 Set Lunch special which I feel is a good deal as it has a starter soup, main course, ice cream dessert and a drink, a large glass of Coke, Sprite or Ice Lemon Tea. This is the 2nd time I have had this and both times the soup (Tomato and Potato) was delicious. Being HRC, of course I had the burger option. It was large and flavourful. I did try a little of the Ribs and Chicken which was also tasty. Dessert was the best - Haagen Daz Chocolate or Strawberry. Both are just great.

Service was very attentive, friendly and helpful. I try not to use disposables like straws and plastic spoons whenever possible and the staff were accommodating when I asked for a metal spoon for my ice cream and did not get puzzled when returned my straw to them.

I will definately go back again especially since they have a eat 4 times and the the 5th set meal free deal. only 2 more times to go."
Birthday celebration,"Everything was good.. Staff also very friendly. Value of money is great, we get a discount. Sure will come again."
Good food but limited menu currently,"Food was good but menu limited in the current covid situation, not the usual menu. Average service. No music vids playing, very very soft music in the background that you can barely hear only if you're sitting near the speaker."
Underrated cafe with incredibly friendly staff,"We've been there twice in 2 weeks, simply because the ribs were unforgettable!

It's perfect for date night, with real food and awesome music, which is what we loved from our first visit. We went back with our family for Sunday lunch and the kids had complimentary kids' meals. Everyone enjoyed the food and surprise birthday sundae so very much. The crew is friendly too!

Price-wise, the food here is a little expensive, but servings are huge. We ordered 3 mains and nachos for 4 adults, and we were stuffed even without touching the fries much. Don't underestimate the sides too. The fries were thick-cut and fluffy on the side, baked beans were flavourful. Plus the bbq sauce was served warm.

We will definitely be back again. And again. And again. And again...."
Value for money set Lunch in Town 😃,Attentive service and great environment to catch up with friends for lunch from 11:30-15:00 hrs and no rush at all
Great food but lacking service.,The waiter was not in the hood and was upset at other guests. I hate feeling like I have to make my waiter happy.
Very good set lunch,"$15 for set lunch on a weekday. Generous servings with a drinks , soup and even a hagen daaz ice cream. Cannot find such good value elsewhere."
Wonderful Halloween Celebrations @ HRC,great decorations and halloween theme @ HRC great service and love the pumpkin decoration competition for kids
Birthday Treat,"It was a good dinner, quiet and good food. Since it was a birthday treat, we were given a wonderful dessert."
Great Birthday meal for my Daughter.,Sad that the staff did not remember or read my note in the reservation and the promotion to get a mask for every $25 spent... I forgot and so did they. Kids love the nacho cheese and burgers so it was fun and good but really pricy... nevertheless we are still fans.
Dessert Time in HRC & Shopping,Managed to walk in and no reservation at all for this lovely place. Crowds are there due to lunch hour. Managed to order brownies and the portion is so huge.Enjoy the dessert so much. Pleasant staff and friendly. Good service too. Highly recommend.
Disappointing birthday meal for son,"Service was poor; the drinks arrived 10 minutes after the food even though everyone else at the bar were freely being served beers as soon as they ordered them. I asked for dressing for my salad-it arrived once everyone else had nearly finished their meal. It was booked as a birthday meal for my 6 year old and I received an email to confirm he would receive a complementary sundae (with sparklers as advertised on the website and experienced by several friends who had taken their children there for birthdays). We had to remind them about his birthday. A tiny ‘sundae’ arrived (mainly just cream in a bowl) with a small candle which was dumped in front of my son by a bored member of staff. We sung to my son.
I complained before we left and I was given the Covid excuse-I have no idea what that has to do with making a boy feel special on his birthday (as I was promised by the staff in the booking). We went to the Waterfall restaurant on Friday and they all sung to my son and he had a lovely free cake with candles and it wasn’t even his birthday! I could also hear the staff laughing at me as I walked off!
Someone rung me to explain again about Covid in the evening. Apparently we get a free brownie the next time we go?
Poor show by Hard Rock Cafe-don’t book for a birthday or any other celebration."
Nice dinner,"Ambience slightly different from the old days. Due to Covid, safe distancing is applied and music is tone down."
"Still as good, after all these years","Haven't been to HRC for many years and was back to celebrate a birthday. Am heartened, in a way, that the decor's still the same, food is just as good (and was the brownie always this humongous??) & service of the staff, warm and friendly. The combo deal was good value but the drinks are overpriced"
Predictable and Reliable,If you are a fan of this chain then you will not be disappointed. All the usual fare together with a few locally influenced alternatives.
What a lovely place,"I visited the Hardrock cafe Singapore between Feb and March 2020. This was during the coronavirus scare, so there were a number of restrictions that had been put in place, like the cafe having to close earlier than usual. Nevertheless we had fun, the food is delicious, the customer care is amazing. Keep up the good work.

Hope to visit again soon."
16th Birthday celebration,My daughter celebrated her birthday there with her friends . The staff and the band made her evening an amazing one ! Thanks guys 😊
When I travel to other countries,"When I travel to other countries I have as a ritual to visit the local Hard Rock Cafe if there is any in the city. This has been always a great experience with a few things here and there to improve but overall a great experience until I visited the branch in Singapore. I arrived at the location around 4pm a there was only two other tables and one extra who seems to be a girl holding a meeting with other team member next to one of the table around the stage area where the sofa seats are. The staff member who was taking our drinks was a bit dismissive like having thoughts about my partner and myself which I found very inappropriate. Then he was “coaching other new staff” if we could say that was a coaching lesson has he didn’t follow the usual client ceremony where they person introduce to the guest.

Then along my meal 3 different staff were helping us which made the experience difficult as you didn’t know who to address to if you need to have extra goods.

I would have expected this place to meet the worldwide standards of the company but obviously this beach as a lot to learn from other places and countries."
Poor Overall Experience,"We have just left Hard Rock Cafe and I cannot say how massively disappointed we where with both where.

1) The service we received was poor, no one asked if our food was ok or that everything was to our satisfaction. The first rule is always make sure the customer is happy. Plus we paid $12.00 for no service.

2) Quiz night, yep we paid over $110.00 for a burger, beer and a quiz night in Russian. And not forgetting no MUSIC, yep no MUSIC IN A HARD ROCK CAFE!

This has to be the worst experience we have had at a Hard Rock Cafe.

Basically we paid a lot of money to receive no service, no atmosphere nothing (in fact it would have been cheaper to have gone to McDonalds and then a pub for some music and atmosphere) and have to listen to a loud quiz which happened to be in Russian. There was no music nothing..... POOR POOR"
Not impressed,"If there's a HRC I have to go there. Also in Singapore. Relatively empty on a Wednesday night, but as always very well greeted as you're the one saving their day. Was there with my travel mate and we shared the Jumbo Combo which is great. Staff very attentive and friendly"
Birthday Dinner for Six,"Not great- Food OK service OK. A little disappointed as my boy (16th Birthday) got a reluctantly served Sundae with no Birthday Song - Obviously the criteria has changed somewhat as they now don`t seem to celebrate customers birthdays - I thought that was the whole point of the Hard Rock Cafe chain ! .
A little surprised as we`ve had many previous great nights there to celebrate previous family Birthdays - And yes it was booked under a Family Birthday Celebration for six guests."
Always the best place and service !!,"Thank you so much to HRC Orchard for the excellent service.
Thank you so much to Jasmine who always taking care of my order and table too.
You deserved to have this compliment on my Tripadvisor page.
Excellent live band, great performance."
Hard Rock Review,"Very good food, attentive waitresses and waiters who were professional and responsive to ones needs. An overall pleasant and enjoyable evening."
Rockin' Good Time,Great food (recommend their Baby Back Ribs and Steak). Great place to celebrate birthdays too. They'll give a cute ice cream sundae and get the entire restaurant to sing you a birthday song.
A nice one!,"We have been to many different Hard Rock Cafés around the world and this was one of the better ones. Pretty big, excellent food. I had the classic Cobb sallad which was very tasty. A big minus was that we had to pay extra when we asked for some extra guacamole and jalapeños for the starter ”Nachos-platter”. The wine was very pricy! Nice staff and we had a pleasent evening with livemusic."
Very friendly staff and clean,Very friendly staff and choice of food for every taste. The prices are Singapore suited but that’s to be expected. We liked the place.
Casual family friendly with great burgers and salads,"We were a group of 12 (6 adults and 6 kids). The Hard Rock were well prepared for our party. The kids had kids meals (mini burgers, grilled chicken or pasta) and the adults had burgers and salads. Each meal works out to be about $30-50 which was reasonable. The food was well prepared and well presented. We took our time and the staff were very accommodating."
Good lunch,"Visited on New Years Day for lunch. Nice and simple, you know what you are getting. Friendly staff and nice atmosphere."
It’s a tradition,It’s a tradition to always go to Hard Rock cafe and so we did. But the atmosphere was a bit dead as it was in the middle of a day and the place was empty. Oh well - the food is always good.
Review,Had the Lasagne. Was not fantastic as there was not enough cheese and it was slightly overcooked. Service was good.
Christmas Dinner,"Heard so much about Hard Rock Cafe in their hay days, and came here for the 1st time for Christmas Dinner with my friends, and was shocked at how empty and quiet the space is!

Service was prompt, and food served are of large portions that made it valued for money l. Ordered 2 burgers and the patties served was a little too dry for our liking. The remaining 2 dishes we ordered fared better than the burgers, that is mac and cheese as salmon. With so many new cafes popping up every now and then, there are surely cafes or resturants that served better food with better ambience too."
Decent food but expensive,Gets by as it's a Hard Rock Cafe so you know what to exoect. But even for Singapore it's is a tad expensive.
Great for group outing,The whole vibe is commendable where we have an attentive male server to our table. Enjoyed his company for sure. Then the life band is awesome on acoustic nights.
No offer of main course after sharing starter for husband's 50th birthday.,"Don't get me wrong about this negative review but my husband is a fan of HRC and was so looking forward to his birthday meal all day. After we ordered our sharing starter, the waitress did not even ask us about our mains, we assumed she'd be back as he had been doing pin trading etc. We had photos with the staff and then they did an unexpected surprise of presenting Jay with a Happy Birthday on stage and a huge dessert for each of us! After that, we didn't feel like we had any room for our mains but just ordered some cheesy chips to share. We didn't feel it was appropriate to say something at the time as it made us feel awkward.
I believe it may have been the in experience of the first waitress who took our order. We had to request the sauce that accompanied the chicken wing starters and then that was the wrong sauce.
The staff were very friendly and I don't like putting this review but I feel it the only thing to put right as it was my husband's 50th and not just any visit."
