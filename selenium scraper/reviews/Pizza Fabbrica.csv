Definitely Not Italian,"The restaurant is located at a tourist spot in Little India. Thus I did not expect to find myself in Napoli of Roma even their website suggests ist. But first time in my 25 years traveller‚Äòs experience in SIN I went out of a Restaurant hungry, with SGD 63 less and fully disappointed.

As a starter I ordered they call a Carpacchio Bresaola, in fact a small plate with some dried ham, full of large capers and without olive oil, aceto balsamico, pepper or even bread.

Then the so called ‚ÄûPizza Marinara‚Äú consisting of 50% crust (yeah, some mostly US like ist, I don‚Äòt), soaked in something tasteless what looked like tomato sauce, rare traces of anchovies and, again, covered with tons of big capers.

Positive: they have botteled birra Peroni, the staff was friendly and there are dozens of was netter restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood."
Disappointing taste,"Had the Gorgonzola and Funghi pizzas, both were really disappointing. Lacked flavour and the mushrooms were slimy and wet."
"Superb pizzas, delicious Tiramisu","The Pizzas here are actually incredible. They do justice to the name ""wood fired"" pizza. We tried a wide variety of pizzas and all were delicious. Along with this, there is an excellent vibe in the place. Their Tiramisu was delicious too"
Good food- terrible service,"Such a shame about this restaurant. The food was quite nice, we had the calamari for starter and pizza for main, but that was one of the worst service I have experienced in a restaurant all year. We had to ask for everything- to order, to clear the starters, for our main to come, for sauces/condiments with our meal. Someone who appeared to be the owner finally came over to see what we needed, but he was rude and said ‚Äòwhat do you want‚Äô - which, from 4 years in hospitality, I believe that not to be the way you greet paying guests. At the end of our meal, the owner again took our payment, and when asking if I could remove the service charge, I was told that it was law in Singapore to pay service charge‚Ä¶. Definitely would not return- I apologise to the chef, however, because the food was nice."
Best Pizza ever,"Very friendly, fantastic atmosphere. We ate pizza, spaghetti and lasagne - everything was delicious. Try also the archipelago beers!"
Best Italian food in singapore!!,"Best italian food in singapore! Its been awhile since I had amazing Italian food. We had 3 pasta, 2 pizzas and cleared our plates.The cream Ravioli was the best. üòäüëç"
"Good food, okay service.",The waiter brought us the wrong food both times and gave us the wrong bill at the end too. They did apologise and was nice to us though
Fabulous pizza and service,"We really like this place. It has become our go to if we want good pizza, great pasta and some people watching. Our ( older kids) really enjoy the different options on the menu, it‚Äôs more than just a couple of tired pizza and pasta choices. Sit back and enjoy the great food and the atmosphere of Haji Lane"
poor/average,"servicing was average . very transactional. food is okay...nothing great . we booked a table . we called that we will be late. however, we were given a table outside saying that others were prioritized. they did shift us inside later though. But it was still near the door and wasnt pleasent. the waiters were very trasactional and i didnt get any sense of customer service ethics"
Great pizza selection and quality...,Really nice place. Pizza was great and awesome selection. Nice beers too and great ambient. Service was good too.
Relaxed pizza place near Haji Lane,Nice vibe in the restaurant and love being able to see them make the pizza dough and pizza fresh. The pizzas were tasty though the gelatos were just average. Restaurant was only 1/3 full but service staff seemed overwhelmed so took a while to get their attention. Parking is a bit of a nightmare in the area too.
Nice deco & food but there's room for improvement,"Visited during lunch as it is a open concept, it is quite hot. Advise to visit after evening and the music is over loud felt like the volume of in a club. Service was excellent, food was delicious."
Great pizza with clear nuances in how they taste,"Went for a family lunch. I had a vegetarian Mediterranean Pizza and it was just great. the dough was soft and thin under the fillings, and thick and little crispy around. All ingredients tasted nice as themselves and they made a great mix together. 24 - 34 sgd for a great pizzas that seemed to be just the right size for lunch. I recommend this place."
Italy in the middle of Haji Lane,"Dinner here with my partner. Place located along side street of Haji Lane.

Atmosphere: cool funky vibe. if you ever been in this area you know...

Drinks: on tap- Archi IPA - we didn‚Äôt really enjoyed it. Luckily , they have bottled IPA Otus. Had 4x of those little guys.
That saved the night.

Food: ltaly in the middle of Haji Lane!
as we were waiting , the lady served us with a focaccia inside a brown paper bag.. A cute touch.
bruschette caprese,carpacio di rucola, burrata e pormodorini
Good food!

Service: was good, as soon as we sat, table water was served straight away. service was fast and done as norm.

Price: slightly expensive , as servings were regular."
"Nice beer, chewy pizzas, awesome service n atmosphere","Came on a Thursday evening for a blokes‚Äô pizza party. Tried the Menabrea beer and 3 pizzas. I won a party organizer accolades for pulling this off:
- great street side ambience
- 10/10 pizzas - chewy and had leopard print burns. They came pretty quickly as promised, on a Thursday evening.
- the menabrea beers got me approvals from the beer connoisseurs in the group
- the only not so good was the bread, which was cold and in a brown bag, given free. Not sure if I should even be complaining, perhaps I immediately drew comparisons to other fine dining Italian joints.
- service was attentive, we hung out after meal was finished and still had water refills. The crew suggested a secret pizza, which further up the good time we had, and made me the host looked good.

The next time I‚Äôm hosting a pizza party in a street/ppl watching atmosphere I‚Äôll be back here. I‚Äôll keep this in my pocket."
"Lovely food, very good service","We received very good service from Sunil who was incredibly attentive to our needs and very friendly. The food was also excellent. Lovely funky setting. Haji Lane is a very atmospheric area with lots of colour and flavour. Our lunch at Pizza Fabbrica was a fantastic experience. It was my first time, but we went there because my daughter had already been and recommended it."
Authentic Taste,"The pizza had an authentic taste, service was rather slow, specially for dessert. The cheque arrived before the dessert :)"
"Amazing, always!",Great food and good people. The lady waitress is very welcoming and has great recommendations. We have been here a few times and our experience only keeps getting better!
Amazing food and service!,"Went for dinner with a couple of friends, ordered the impossible fettuccine Bolognese and it was simply outstanding! The margarita pizza was also amazing, and they had a good and fairly priced wine selection. Sunil was our server and was really attentive and friendly. Would definitely recommend!"
Enjoyed the visit,Very good restaurant with good food and great service. Pizzas are awesome. Walking down the Haji lane is an interesting.
Reasonably priced with excellent service,"Was at Pizza Fabbrica at Haji Lane for an evening business meeting and was pleasantly surprised with their delightful menu, reasonable pricing considering the huge portion size of the dishes, energetic atmosphere and most worthy of a great shout out, their wonderful service. Special mention for Sunil, of the service team that attended to us. He is a fantastic chap filled with honesty, sincerity and helpfulness, always paying attention to all details so that our experience were kept flawlessly terrific. He is one of the main contributing factors that I will be looking forward to my next visit soon."
Alice Bday 5 Sep 2020,"Booked this place for Alice‚Äôs bday. Not crowded for a sat lunch.. we ordered the calamari, seafood stew, Four-cheese pizza, Kale salad & seafood pizza. Awesome dishes! My fave is the seafood stew!üëçüèª prompt & friendly service too. Will visit again!"
Good pizza in Haji Lane,"Visited with friends after long time, quality of food and service is good. Honest prices. Recommended for a dinner with friends."
Fab tasty pizza cooked in a wood fired oven,"Booked a table easily about an hour before arrival. We were seated and oddly only given one menu between four people.

Happy hour was about to end so ordered prosecco and Aperol Sprirtz at $10 a glass.

The arancini starter was really good. We all really enjoyed the tasty pizzas that were cooked in a wood fired oven. Good dough and fresh tasty ingredients. The only slight issue was that they seemed only to be able to cook two at a time so we had to wait for the third pizza.

All drinks were good, especially the special ‚Äòshar-tini‚Äô which was a really good espresso martini! Both the tiramisu and pistachio gelato were really good!

Service was ok. It was fairly easy to order and food was quite quick, maybe could just be a little friendlier."
Nice & cozy,"Great authentic Italian food especially the Ravioli Al Fungi, delicious. Enjoyed my dinner there with my family."
Good Value,The place was busy and I was a little concerned about the lip service paid to social distancing. The service left a lot to be desired as it was difficult to attract the wait service staff. Things asked for were promised but not delivered e.g ice for water (had to ask twice) as well a couple of other requests. There were three of us but only brought two glasses. Overall I hope these things can be improved on. I have taken into account that this is a difficult time for the hospitality industry.
Slow and disorganised,"Waited really long for the food to arrive, only for one of the orders to be left out at that. To end off the night on an even worse note, the floor staff managed to swipe my card for another table's orders, even after I've checked the bill before passing my card to them. Food was all right I guess‚Äînothing tastes bad when you're hungry after waiting 30 minutes for food."
Great Italian,"Friend brought me here for dinner and it was amazing. The starters, egg plant parmigiana, bruschetta and caprese salad out of the world. The mains 2 pizzas and spaghetti bolognaisse to die for. Prices really reasonable."
Excellent food in the Arab Quarter,This is five star for this type of restaurant. The food is terrific- it‚Äôs not just pizza. We had great pasta too. The service was also very good.
A great ‚ÄúNapoli‚Äù style pizza at the level very good pizzerias in Italy,"I am originally Italian and I love pizza as they do in Napoli, the Capital of the real genuine pizza. i was impressed by the quality of the pizza by Pizza Fabbrica, a genuine Neapolitan style pizza, two thumbs up, well done"
Wood fired oven bakes your authentic pizzas,"Their speciality gourmet pizza with the wooden oven baked base is a good option. Some vegan options are there with impossible meat, however it‚Äôs too bland. If you like Italian, you can definitely give this place a try for authentic taste."
"great pizza, great service",pizza was excellent. well cooked thin crust from a wood fire oven. toppings were generous; rustic in styling but with the best ingredients. service was attentive without being invasive desserts were pretty standard but also good quality the fig salad was really good.
Diner,"Lekkah, good pizza, good wine , good personel, good pasta, good risotto, would recommend. Very nice."
One of the best pizzas in Singapore,"Quick service, Neapolitan style pizza, really well executed and the ingredients are high quality (the burrata w/ cold cuts is recommended) - although it‚Äôs all a little overpriced. The restaurant location is a bit unfortunate as there‚Äôs a live band right in front which is quite loud."
Mediocre Food,This was my 2nd visit after 1.5 yrs. Ordered pizza as before. Food quality has deteriorated since the first visit. Pizza choices available all seemed very similar.
As close to Italy as it gets,We have been here a couple of times and my partner who‚Äôs Italian could not be happier. We have tried many pizzerie in Singapore and this is the one that will go back again and again. The pizzas are authentically Italian where I lived for a few years as well. It even has chili oil instead of the typical either Tabasco or chili flakes you find in Singapore when you ask for chili oil. Affogato and pasta are also delights. The atmosphere in the area is great on weekends as well.
Tasty flow of pizzas,This is a place where you can go for yummy pizzas. The decor is nice. I like the delicious pizzas and drinks that come with them.
Fun & not bank breaking,"Lovely marinated olives, nice wines, attentive & pleasant hosts, salads very nice, a good spot to watch the world go by. Great for pleasant but relaxed dining, and they‚Äôll let you do it slowly."
Great pasta and pizza,We had a great experience at Pizza Fabbrica with the pasta and pizza being excellent. We had very good service from the staff.
Best Neapolitan pizza in Singapore,"We have been to Naples and I can tell you that, the pizza here was pretty close. In fact, it‚Äôs the best Neapolitan pizza we have had in Singapore so far and will definitely go back. Service was also great specially ‚ÄúKim‚Äù and she was very attentive and professional."
Awful! Avoid it!,"Just terrible. Pizza was burnt, staff couldn‚Äôt care less and the toilets were a health hazard. Really wouldn‚Äôt recommend going here. Avoid at all costs."
Gathering at Fabbrica,It‚Äôs not a bad place to have gathering ... although the band is relatively ‚Äòloud‚Äô... food wise is consider above average and service is good
Cosy atmosphere and great authentic Italian food,Service was prompt and the dishes are amazing..I ordered the home made squid ink pasta and it was worth it as the pas was steaming hot and fresh.. The bread are also tasty. Highly recommended. Will definitely be back again. Reservations needed on weekends as it can get crowded.
Fabulous pizza,Had a wonderful lunch - great pizzas. The flour and the tomatoes they use must be good as the pizzas come out with the right textures and flavours.
Chewy Pizza! Love it...,"Pizza is great. Wine selection is great... and additional options of craft beers.
The service was great. We ordered the wrong pizza and they are more than happy to change for you.
The restaurant is located 10 mins walk away from Bugis MRT and a bustling tourist area."
Good ambiance,"It is a very good place to chill with friends. The food was great. The staff were very attentive and courteous. Overall, my friends and I enjoyed our experience there."
It‚Äôs OK,It‚Äôs priced on the high side. Had 5 dishes from the pasta and pizza menu but portion wise is not generous.
Thank you Trip Advisor!,Only booked this restaurant because it had a good rating on Trip Advisor and we wasn't disappointed. This is right in the heart of Haji lane/Arab Street and has a great atmosphere. A band was playing when we were here and it just added to a great evening. I had pizza and my son and husband both had the spaghetti carbonara. Everything was tasty and the tiramisu for dessert was excellent. Definitely worth a visit.
"Great food, friendly service, good atmosphere",We had an anniversary dinner celebration at Pizza Fabbrica for my parents. The waiters were very friendly and helped us surprise them by bringing out a present with the appetizers. The pizzas were delicious and came out of the kitchen very quickly. Nice atmosphere as there was a live band performing on the street outside.
Simply terrible.,Appetisers and pasta were absolutely disastrous. Pizza was palatable but lacklustre. Verdict: horrible. Do not even bother.
Good Pizza and Nice Area,"I took my girlfriend here for her 21st birthday because she loooooves pizza and this place had good reviews and a couple certificates of excellence. The food did not disappoint. We got the bruschetta to start and then she got the Margherita pizza and I got the sausage and pepper pizza. All three plates tased great. Additionally, the walking area around the restaurant (located near Arab St.) was beautiful and exciting. Also, the live music was great. The reason I don't give 5 stars is because the service wasn't great and it was a little too expensive, in my opinion."
Nice place,great food and nice service hv professional guy mario he hv nice recommendation i like this place live music so relax we enjoy with food and drinks thanx mario!!!!!!!!!
Beware if they charge you in your home currency - extra 6%,"Food and service were good. We told the waiter 3 times we wanted to be charged in Singapore $ not US $ He was either deaf, stupid, or dishonest. In 6 weeks of travel,
this is the ONLY time we were charged in our home currency. Cost us an extra 6%.
We have taken care of it (not with the restaurant) Just be forewarned. When this happens, the restaurant oftentimes has a deal with the Bank.
Too bad- pleasant evening and food until this happened."
Great pizza poor ingredients,"The overall experience at Fabricca was extremely sub par. There was a lot of anticipation for the pizza to be great but it largely fell short. We had the funghi, salsiccia and pepperoni as well as the bresaola. The funghi and scarmozza was really pathetic, the mushrooms were scarce if any and also poorly spread out. The other two pizzas mostly lacked flavor except for the tomato sauce being the only saving grace for this place. Service was poor even though the restaurant wasn‚Äôt full at lunch."
Good choice,Good pizza at the arab street. Nice place and efficient service. It is a valid option with you are in the area.
One of the best pizza in singapore.,"Great location, cozy modern designed interiors, few choices for flavours, but mostly classic flavours done to perfection, price is ok-ish, staff is helpful."
Not a bad choice,Had lunch with friends and enjoyed our meal. Service is very good and our food was tasty. My friends calzone was a bit ‚Äútoasted‚Äù but she said it was still tasty. I had the carbonara which was delicious and the pasta is homemade. Dessert was good as well. There is indoor and outdoor seating available. Indoor could be a bit cooler but I‚Äôm always hot here in Singapore. It is worth a stop if in the area.
Authentic Neapolitan Pizza,Great pizza just like being in Naples. Good value too. I had the Prosciutto Crudo pizza and it was very flavoursome. Highly recommended.
Delicious Pizza and Italian dishes for groups,"Made a rez for 3 people.Ordered cut cuts, baked eggplant and 2 pizzas: margherita and seafood pizza.They were all delicious. Portions are generous and pizzas are baked to order.Lovely charred bits and fresh ingredients; nice texture to the dough as well.Service was prompt, friendly and attentive.One of my favourite pizza joints in Singapore a delicious casual pizza dinner and wine!Highly recommended."
Good pizza and service,"I been there as my friend suggested me. Beer is good, pizza ingredients and taste very good if you like napoli style pizza. Location is inside the muslim area of singapore. Must try it."
Not the best pizza,The atmosphere and the pizza is not that good! Burnt crusts and basically just a tomato sauce pizza as they were very stingy with the mozzarella as some slices did not have any cheese.
Authentic quality food at reasonable price!,We held our Asia Sales Team dinner with Pizza Fabbrica. And the waiters and waitresses are very nice and patience providing quick service to us.
nothing special,"go there with some my friend to try the pizza....honestly nothing special , in singapore can find some more nice place and better pizza"
Authentic & delicious,"We actually came here when our first option was too busy. But we were welcomed with quality friendly service, authentic Italian pizza and the restaurant is situated near Arab Street & Haji Lane, which makes for great people watching and lots of nearby things to explore. If we had another night here, we would have definitely come back for more!"
Excellent,Perfectly authentic Neapolitan style pizza and delicious hand made pastas. We'll be back many more times!
Pizza,"Definitely one of the best pizza in town!
It‚Äôs is just how pizza should be!
The waiters are nice ...
did not understand one of the waiters commenting about being a real man because he has 5 kids around the world.
I believe waiters should not make this kind of comment to clients !"
Best pizza in years,"We stumbled across Pizza Fabbrica when exploring Arab Street. Great find! Lovely service, good AC, lovely menu and restaurant and the food was fantastic. Must be one of the best pizzas I‚Äôve ever had! 5*"
Mr,"Even though the bartenders were very nice, the pizza was small and did nor taste good. Since the neighborhood is roch with restaurants it should not be a problem to find something better"
Not Just pizza,"Enjoyed Alfresco dining with a glass of Primitivo much better than I would usually expect. Beef carpaccio, Bruschetta and Fig salad. Could have been in Italy."
Recommend,Good Italian food. The street is closed for traffic on weekends (don't know about weekdays) and the atmosphere is very nice. Very good band was playing but not so loud that you couldn't talk without shouting. Nice staff as well.
Excellent Pizza!,"Had an early dinner at around 6.30. As to be expected I did not get the best table as I was just by myself. So what.
Ordered a Fig Salad and a Pizza with Italian Sausage and Peperoncino. The salad arrived promptly after about 5 minutes. Bed of rucalo, 1 ript sliced fig and some pine nuts. Nicely done, the balsamico on the rucola was very sweet, I assume there is some sugar involved. Overall a nice starter.
The pizza was excellent. Clearly coming from a wood oven, crispy crust on the outside, moist in the centre. Very good ingredients, the sausage and the mozzarella are clearly above average from a quality perspective. To my taste the peperoncini (red and greeen chili) were cut a bit too coarsly, they were actually quite big chunks. Chopping them finer would allow to spread the aroma and spice more evenly across the pizza. Overall, a very nice pizza!
Service was quick, attentive and friendly."
"Great pizza, brilliant vibe",Love this place on a Friday /Saturday night. Good Italian fare with an excellent ambience with the live music.
Great Italian food in the middle of Arab Street,"Their food was really good and had generous portions, especially the Pizza's. Lives up to the name. Also the ambience was very nice"
Friday night kinda place,"Wine is very good, service is good, pizza is average. Bervages list is good. Too much pork dishes on the mains"
Good Italian food,I enjoyed my Italian dinner at the lively vicinity of Bussorah Street. The only issue I had was with one of the servers who was a bit clueless about things.
Great crusts,"Visited Fabbrica after having a craving for proper Neapolitan pizza. Although nothing is quite like pizza from Naples, the pizza here is excellent! Great dough, crust and tomato base. Good choice of Italian beer too. The golden ale bites del Perugia is fantastic."
Yummy pizza,"The pizza selection is very good, nice dough with great ingredients like porcini mushroom, scamorza and great buffalo mozzarella. Interesting variety of craft beers and lively atmosphere."
"Nice place, not so good service","Pizzas was legit. Food was great. As it was my first time visit, asked the service staff for recommendations which wasn't really helpful. Food was great though. Service could have been better"
"Excellent, creative traditional Italian fare","Waiting time was short and service was adequate. I have to say, in terms of it's food, this is by far one of the best Italian restaurants i have been to."
Great food and lovely service always,The Oktoberfest sausage specials were delicious - proves that you're both great in your pizzas and more...! Fantastic band too
Nice Pizza,tried the restaurant a few days back. Very nice Pizza. Unfortunately I did not manage to try their pasta dishes.
Excellent Pizza,"Tasty and soft pizza with thin crust, exactly the way I like my pizza. Nice decor and very good service. My friend had a risotto and panna cotta and was pleased too. Their beers on tap is a nice touch."
Great Pizza and Pasta,Enjoyed their Fennel Sausage Pizza and their Ravioli Agnello for lunch. Prices are what you expect to pay in Singapore for this type of restaurant. Great tasting and fresh! Finished with two glasses of wine. Service was excellent. Handy location to our hotel Pan Pacific Serviced Suits. Great place for dinner also better atmosphere and I have heard they have a band playing in the evening.
Italian style pizza in South East Asia,"I was very pleasantly surprised to find this pizzeria so close to Arab Street. Service was friendly, and there was a good choice of wine, beer and soft drinks, including my favourite, which is quite hard to come across outside Europe - San Pellegrino in Chinotto flavour. The pizzas themselves we as delicious as some I've had in Italy , with an excellent tomato base and very good cheese. Ingredients were obviously carefully sourced. It is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for!"
Great food and fantastic service,Pizzas never fail here! The dough and ingredients are fresh and there is a great selection of pizzas to choose from. Definitely try the tartufo dessert too!!!
Serves good pizza,Serves very good pizza. Service can be better though. Outdoor seating available and it's in the vibrant Arab Street area.
Great pizza!,"Had a wonderful experience! Great, fresh ingredients- pizzas w the right kind of crust, thin enough in the Centre w some bite on the edges, for me! Great quality burrata! Also had a great Italian beer w the meal...complemented it very well."
nice pizza in the arab quarters,"well that is not the place I was going for a pizza. it's in the middle of an Arab quarter, with shops and restaurants that offer arab products and foods. The place is really nice and worth a visit.
As I happened to be there, we saw this Italian restaurant and wanted to give it a try.
All the pizzas and pastas that we ate were very good. I give it 4 stars only because I found the crust of the pizza that was too burnt and too salty for my taste. Other than that, I recommend it"
So good,"Best pizza in Singapore, hands down! While it may be a bit pricey, it's very authentic and the ingredients used are fresh and high quality. Even my friends who are from italu praise the pizza here, so definitely go. Recommend the burrata pizza and the fig one!"
Great pizza and nice people,"I liked the gourmet pizzas because they have ingredients that are a rarer to find in Singapore, but still authentic italian. Definitely all the pizzas are a must try. Good range of cocktails, especially my fav Negroni."
terrible pizza stay away,"had a Mediterranean pizza which had cheese, tomato and olives. I think the dough was not rolled evenly , ended up too thin at the centre an thick and mushy on the sides. Not crispy at all on the sides.

We did mention our disappointment to the attendant, and he did not apologize or acknowledge that we were let down. So, all in all, poor food and indifferent service."
"Terrible, terrible service!","I've been before and it was good, so was really surprised when my recent trip with a group of friends was so terrible. One main meal arrived before the starters, the drinks took what seemed like an age to arrive, and then three of our group didn't even get their meal at all. The management was very apologetic, which eased the disappointment to a degree (but not the empty stomachs of some), but the battle to get the bill sorted and some food that we hadn't even ordered removed, made the experience a complete disaster. Such a shame."
One of the best pizzas here,"I have been on the hunt for the best margherita pizzas the past few weeks and this is one of the best yet.

Delicious char on crust, check. Crispy crust and soft interior, check. Flavourful crust, check. Balance between crust, char, and sauce, check.

At this point the buffalo mozzarella and basil leaves (all 2 leaves of it...) aren't that important now. =P

That's how great pizzas are like in my book; the crust is everything and this one is perfect.

Extra points for wine and beer pairing charts in the restaurant too, but wished the waiter would have recommended me a drink though."
Best Pizza in SG,One of the best wood fire Pizzas I've ever had in SG. good selection of craft beers which went well with the pizza.
On the Lanes,Not on Haji Lane but close by is this sweet little pizzeria. I would advise booking. All doors and windows along the front were open so you can watch the world go by. Food tasted great and the staff were lovely.
Hidden gem in Bugis,Food is quite good. Loved the pizza special with swordfish carpaccio and also the crabmeat pasta. It's a pity there's no happy hour here. Service is a bit slow
Great place for gathering,The foods are a little pricey but certainly worth all the qualities and freshness. Personally liked the risottos and the artisan 32-Curmi beers a lot! Great live band on Saturday night. Can't wait for my next visit.
some of the worst pizza I've had‚Äù,the pizza burnt on the edge and soggy in the middle. Also the dough was insipid..... horrible experience!!!!!
Always a pleasure,"Good pizza, always go for Margarita with mozzarella Di bufala. Staff is always kind, serving you a piece of homemade focaccia to start the meal. Good for dates and groups"
Great pizza and risotto!,"Hidden within Arab street zone, this Italian restaurant offers authentic italian pizza and awesome Risotto! Love the truffle poccini mushroom risotto which reminds me of my meal in Milan. Wide selection of pizza and booze to pair your food with. Last but not least, service was good with waiter really attentive to our needs"
