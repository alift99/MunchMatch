Great food of consistent quality with really friendly and attentive service,"I have lost count on the number of times i have returned to this restaurant. I really love the great tasting food and tried almost every main course on the menu and still not getting tired with any of them, especially the duck confit, beef and the salmon. French onion soup and the lobster bisque are definitely my favorites too. Staff are really friendly and nice. Superb experience at reasonable price. Highly recommended. :)"
Good Spot for a hearty French lunch,"I made reservations for a slot at 12noon and was a bit annoyed that the place was locked when I arrived at 11.50am. There were people inside but they would not open the door earlier for you. When the clock stuck 12, one man open the door and did not say a single word nor had a smile. Grim day.
Food was good though, no complains. So my advice is to be late or not book the 12noon slot unless you like to bake in the sun waiting for them to open the door."
Awesome dinner. Will go back for more,The set dinner meal is value for money. I have chosen the lobster soup and it is superb delicious. The steak is done perfectly and the sorbet is perfect for cleaning up my palette.
Poor service and not great food,"Went to hear as I had heard rave reviews on the place but I have to admit I was quite shocked on the standard of service and food.

We were on time at the restaurant and waited patiently for someone to welcome us and take us to our table. After about 5 mins someone just waved us in and told us to sit at a table but didn‚Äôt have the decency to come and show us the table nor actually say hello!

It took about 10 mins to order our food. As a family of 4 we all wanted different starters but 3 of us had the same mains. What I found weird was that as soon as someone finished their starters the plates were immediately cleared away even if the others were still eating. Then the mains were immediately put down whilst others were still on their first course. We tried to ask the staff to slowdown but they were always scurrying around and had no time to listen.

We risked the desserts which were again served at different times and I had the creme br√ªl√©e which was severely over caramelised on one side ie burnt.

After paying for the bill and having our credit card just dropped on our table within any thank you we just left. There was no ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù, no ‚Äúplease come again‚Äù, just nothing.

The meal cost about $500 with drinks and I have to admit it was money well wasted. Definitely not a place to take kids and definitively not a place for business lunches.

We won‚Äôt be going again."
Great place for an occasion,My 2nd time coming back to have the Steak Frites. My favourite dish and arguably the best steak I've eaten to date. Other starters and appetizers like the french onion soup and the angel hair pasta is great too.
Please keep up the good service and food,"Food is great eventho they have shrunk in size. However, I do hope the waiter can serve patrons better, at least with a sincere smile, waitresses were good, but the waiter was quite rude, didn‚Äôt even smile when he serve the food. Took quite sometime for us to get the waiter‚Äôs attention when we need to order, restaurant was not even full or busy."
Unpretentious French cuisine,"My go-to place for an easy-on-wallet and above decent French cuisine. Usually order the pan-seared foie gras, angel hair pasta, duck confit and lamb shank (just tried this, it's tender enough for my liking). I think they changed their menu with slight increase in the price as well."
Very nice,"Very nice. Would say perfect but steak was very fatty. Rest of meal was great, good wine suggestions, pate was nice, vegGoes and break excellent, cheese plate and desert all great"
Above average,"First visit, decided to give a try after reading some positive reviews here. The confit de canard was just average, the meat a bit tough, a bit disappointed, I guess this is one of their signature dishes. The foie gras poele was good, my second time ordering this as a complete dish in a restaurant, can go back for more of this but not sure what main dish to pick. The mashed potato was above average. I liked the bread basket.
Ambience okay and normal customer service."
First time but definitely not the last!,"Great ambience, service food and wine at really reasonable prices. Will be going back. Also the location is perfect if in the CBD."
Great Food and service be aware of the phone call from a +65 number to confirm,"Service was fantastic. Food was excellent. Significant value for money for family of 5.
Be aware that the confirmation call from an automated system uses a +65 number to call. I didn't pick up the first 2 times but decided uncharacteristically to pick up on third attempt. It sounded like the usual +65 scam call messaging voice until I heard the actual message to confirm my reservation!"
Better than expected,I have been to Saveur on many occasions and I was surprised this time that both the service and quality of food have improved. We had a very enjoyable evening. Highly recommended. The wine selection was good but a little over priced.
Nice Place,Restaurant is clean and welcoming. Excellent service crew. Went for the set meal. Very reasonably priced. Starters and desserts were marvelous. Oysters were a bit less plump but was good. Guess cannot complain considering the price. The mains has more room to upgrade. Tasted sort of Ikea food though. Good range of wines and they have good wines. Prices of the wine is unbeatable as compared to most restaurant.
Great french food without breaking the bank,Staff was attentive and food was served promptly and according to order .Tasty french food without breaking the bank.
Next time will try the steak,All of us had the duck confit and enjoyed it very much. Would have ordered the mussels and chips but we did not notice the specials board until too late.
Room for improvement.,"Great ambience, attentive staff but foodwise, a little disappointing. Had heard friends raving about how good the duck confit was but when I patronised, the duck was extremely dry. It didn't look freshly cooked. The taste of the duck, however was the saving grace. Would probably return for the lobster bisque and the steak. Hopefully, the chef improves the quality of the duck soon!"
Fantastic French Food,"My family 1st time had lunch in a french restaurant which was highly recommended by Church friend. All the dishes we order were excellent in presentation, great taste and even quantity is more than enough. Will definitely go back to try other dishes."
Great Experience,Food was delicious and service was superb one of my suggestion is that given an option for dessert i.e either dessert or coffee or a drink
"Great Food, Good Atmosphere with excellent service","Amazing experience, the food was delicious. We opted for the set Menu which I thought was good value. I had the French onion soup, wow it was the best I've ever tasted I loved it. My steak was cooked to perfection. The atmosphere was great and intimate, and the service was very good and attentive. Overall a wonderful experience with amazing food"
Excellent Food!,"I visited Saveur twice in the last 3 months and once again, it delivers excellent quality of food and quantity. Must visit again."
Amazing Classic French food,A no frill restaurant that serves amazing classic french food cooked to perfection. The confit duck‚Äôs crispy skin and moist meat paired with rich gravy and Beef Bourgogne that melts in your mouth are amazing!
Will be back,"Ordered the 3 course meal: escargot, steak and creme brulee. And lobster bisque and beef cheek. Really love it, especially bisque and beef cheek!"
20thMay2022,"5 pax. ordered the set meal. duck confit, salmon, beef striploin. all meat cooked to perfection. especially the beef, medium rare.

Pinot noir red wine recommended by the manager was very good, what we wanted, easy to drink.

service is excellent! The bread, piping hot is also very delicious, i do not like bread but i had the most there.

we spent about $86 per pax.

i would recommend Saveur."
Great tasting French food,"Had dinner at Saveur on a weekday night last week. Luckily I had a reservation as the place was pretty crowed. My friend and I had their set dinner. Both the onion soup and escargots we had for starters were excellent. As for the mains, the duck confit was tender, juicy and very delicious. So was the pan roasted veal sweetbread. Large selection of wines available and the Chardonnay we had was very good.

Ambiance was nice and service was good. The best thing was the quality of the food at such reasonable pricing. Highly recommended!"
"Good service, good food","From making table reservation via Chope to the completion of luncheon, all went well. Restaurant is centrally located and easily accessible."
Excellent!,Service was quick with reservation. Food is still as delicious as my last visit years before. Highly recommended for an authentic taste of French cuisine without hurting your wallets.
Very good food,The food was really good but the AC is too cold. French bistrot athmosphere is appreciable. Would recommend with a sweat shirt :)
great little bistrot,"This is a great little place. We had the ""table d'hote"" and everything was delicious. The service was also very good with pleasant and efficient waiters. The walls are bear and need to be decorated though. The place is lacking a vibe, but I will definitely go back"
Always good,We always enjoy dining at Saveur. Good food and friendly service. A must have is the Saveur Pasta. It's my daughter's favourite.
Food taste super goodüëç,"Everything was satisfied. I think the atmosphere can be better, like the interior design or lighting can be more romantic"
Service,Friendly stuff! Excellent service provided. Boss cutting cake skills is very pro üòÇ. Will definitely come back again!
Great family meal,"Excellent service and food is just as good as when it first started, though the price is a little steeper now, there is deals around."
Good food good service,"Service is good despite some of the negative reviews in google. It was a full house during our dinner. Had mignon, cod & duck confit as mains & they were well-executed. Would like to try their set lunch someday"
Lunch,Lunch gathering with a group of friends at Saveur. The service crew were attentive and readily got our orders when we were ready. All of us ordered duck confit and the dish tasted excellent! Go to place for this dish.
Lunch Outing,The french onion soup was a bit salty and the creme brulee was a bit soft. The service staff was very attentive.
Fantastic food that is value for money. The restaurant was,"The food was great and quite affordable. However, my 6 year old son finds the place a little noisy. This won't stop us from going back though."
Christmas dinner,The Christmas dinner was awful especially the main course i.e lobster only the dessert (i.e. chocolate tart) is edible very disappointed with the food
Salt was used to cover the quality and freshness of Cod,I am a seafood fan. My choice of Cod fish as a main dish from the restaurants menu had a very fishy smell and uneven parts of the fish was heavily salted.
The food and service were both good,"We visited it on last Thur to celebrate our child's birthday. Love the signature Saveur's Pasta, it is simple and yet very delicious. The waiters were very helpful during our dinner. Thanks for the birthday free dessert. This restaurant would pinned on our French restaurant list from now on."
Great French cuisine by local chef.,Used to patronized this restaurant. Seems to have down sized. Nevertheless food still as good. Slightly pricey but that's French!
Good food and service with zero ambiance,"the food is good quality French bistro and service is friendly and prompt - but the experience is diluted by the fact the room is more like a white walled storage unit than a dining space. Perhaps they are in mid renovation ? - not sure , but a little imagination would change the guest experience"
"Fab food, bland restaurant!","So this was our first time at this restaurant as we both love French food. First impressions was it was like a hospital corridor, all white walls with chunks out of nearly all of the walls (obviously part of the build), we had to ask for water to remove our masks after 5 mins (this now should just be automatic as soon as a customer sits down). And all the menu is via a QR code again pretty standard these days.

Food - good to see that you could choose the set menu especially on a Saturday evening (so top marks for that)
Starter of Foie Gras was delicious all cooked fresh, my wife had the Salade Bistrot which she enjoyed too.
There was a nice gap between the starter & mains which is always nice (5-10 mins)
Mains- I had the Filet Mignon au poivre (extra $14) but absolutely worth it presented in two 6oz filet surrounded by Peppercorn sauce accompanied with green beans & Potato Au Gratin (served in a separate dish on the side) the filet was cooked medium & perfect & melted in the mouth, so 10/10.

My wife had the Salmon which specified Pan -seared, this was not the case & was in our opinion very much over cooked, but my wife still enjoyed the dish.

Dessert - Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e was super, shame there was not actually any black vanilla pod seeds in the mixture to give it more of a vanilla taste.

Cheese board was excellent too 4 cheeses with walnuts, fig bits & crackers & grapes, my wife didn‚Äôt eat it all as she was full by this time.

Overall - great value meal for the price of $54 ++ 8/10
Restaurant - 3/10 could do with having pictures on the walls to spruce up the place & not make it look so hospitalised, and try to hide or pain over the electric pipe work you have on the walls for the light bulbs.

We would go back for the food, but the restaurant is not the warmest of places for a cosy Saturday night meal, which is a shame as it has so much potential."
One of our favs,It's always been a pleasure to dine here. Quality of food and service is excellent. Had an enjoyable celebration for the start of the school holidays.
Awesome and affordable good quality french food.,"We have craving for french food but did not want to spend the dollars on super expensive fine dining while having good quality duck confit. Saveur meets the expectation in every way. The set menu is value for money and featured their signatures under each category. We had the foie gras and onion soup for appetizers, duck confit and beef mignon for mains and creme bulee and panna cotta for dessert. On top of that, i ordered an ala carte Saveur Pasta appetizer. My hub said his fav of the day is the Saveur Pasta which was really addictive to eat. The onion soup was super rich and heavy to start. I was already half full finishing the appetizer. The duck confit was well cooked and every mouth is filled with the duck aroma smell with crispy bite. The beef mignon is well cooked and well sprinkled with pepper and salt that the taste stand out with every bite. Definitely recommend the restaurant.

The only downside would probably be the decor of the restaurant which is very simple looking but that does not affect our experience with the great food."
Food was not up to expectations,Duck confit was too dry. Beef stew was alright. Foie gras was bad. Tastes like a lower grade ingredient. Pasta was not made very well. Crunchy instead of springy
Birthday celebrations,Good food at reasonable price. Satisfied with their support of my request for birthday celebrations at their restaurant. Excellent services.
Standards have dropped,"I have visited Saveur since years ago and that was when their food was really good, value for money and affordable. Now their portion size remained the same or shrink but price increased by about 3x and yet the standard or taste of the food dropped by a lot a lot. Really disappointed with it, will not visit anymore."
"Good food, poor ambience",Came back for a second visit cos the food is nice. but acoustics is really bad. It was so noisy. Ambience is not conducive for a nice relaxing meal.
"Food nice, atmosphere good, service work in progress","food presentable, delicious. No flexibility for the set menu for 2 when asked if we didnt want the wine option for lunch. charged for plain water, even after 2 bottles of sparkling water ordered and consumed. Other than that, really good and will return."
Great experience,We really enjoyed coming back for the pleasant and welcoming service and great tasting food. The meats were cooked to our liking and the sauces and side dishes with very delicate flavours. Well done to the team
Incredible food but...,"The cuisine is flawless, but their bathroom door doesn't lock, and even though I was the first customer in the entire restaurant, the toilet seat was covered in pee. Clearly some staff didn't care about basic hygiene or courtesy. Makes one concern about whether they wash their hands after bathroom break."
A great tasting French restaurant,"Food was great, no complaints at all. Onion soup, foie gras, fillet mignon, pistachio panna cotta and creme brulee was on point. Pan seared salmon was just okay. Other than that service can be a bit better but understandable as the staff was new. So definitely worth coming again."
Good French food,"The place decoration was simple and the service was ok. The food on the other hand was good. We had the Duck Confit and the Fillet Mignon both tasted very good especially the Fillet Mignon which is tender and nicely spiced. The Country Pate was great and the Onion soup was rich with taste. Overall the experience was good, especially on the food. They even throw in a complimentary mini tart for the birthday occasion. Many thanks!"
Poor Service,"Did not change cutlery after every meal. Expected to reuse for subsequent meal. We pay additional fee for the flowers, expecting fresh flowers, but turn out to be dried flowers on Valentines Day...!"
Overpriced and quality has dropped,"Came here with 2 other friends, 2 of us had the duck, another had the salmon (we didn't order the set meal as we realized that the price jumped from previously at $29.90++ to now $50++ so we were rather shocked at this)

Sadly, our duck was too salty and my friend's salmon was dry (no sauce) and the taste was rather lacking according to him.

Unfortunately i don't think we will be coming here anymore as it's just not the same quality as it used to be."
Mediocre fare,The standard has dropped a lot since i first dined here in 2014. Duck confit was very dry. Foie gras was oversalted and its garnishes did not match at all. Redeeming factors were the rich onion soup and creme brulee for dessert.
Dinner,The ambience was as what I expected. The dress code was smart casual but saw a few in bermudas & slippers. Food wasn't to my expectation. Only enjoyed the foie gras.
Happy returns,"This is the second time we have eaten in Saveur, both occasions have been mid week evenings. The restaurant which is bistro style with simple d√©cor wasn't busy but still had had a lively atmosphere, the service was good, food delicious and well presented. This time we were able to have their signature sharing rib, they were sold out the first time. It was excellent but so was the fish last time. Be wary that the starters are large if you are choosing the rib as a main. We'll be back."
Love the food. Still as good as before,"Food is excellent! Ordered the 3 course meal & it is value for money for an authentic French restaurant. Mignon is very tender and juicy, my all time favourite! the truffle spaghetti is great & my 4yr old enjoyed it with his Salmon that‚Äôs cooked just right, juicy inside with some spice on top! Lastly the desert is yummy ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Great food.,The atmosphere of the restaurant is cosy. The food is really good and worth the price to eat. Good place for couple as well.
Paying for water in 2020?,"I decided to go back to Saveur after a 2 years or so hiatus, curious to see if the experience was as great as I remembered.

Unfortunately this place has now decided to make you pay for water, and refuses to serve tap water. Considering the price range of the average a la carte dish on the menu, I find that distasteful at best.

People with M1 or Circles Life mobile plan won't be able to get reception inside the restaurant, which in itself wouldn't a big deal, if the menu set was not now exclusively available through a QR code....

The website was also down, so we found ourselves unable to look at the food options, until the website got back up, as there was no other way to consult the menu. A great example where technology seems to be have been deployed without thinking about the customer experience.

The food itself was great, and the service on the upper end of the spectrum."
Standard of food has dropped so much,Brought my sister there to celebrate the end of her confinement week after giving birth. Ordered a cod fish ($40+) and was terribly disappointed. Fish came terribly overcooked and hard.
Great food,"The food is great as usual. Spent about $35 per pax for lunch, a little expensive. Keep up the good good and service."
foie gras must try,"simple decoration and poor wifi connection for M1 users, totally no connection. Ordered the 3 course meal, very happy with the first dish which was the foie gras, it was juicy and meltz in your mouth. Add on money for the Filet mignon Au Poivre, i ordered mid well, it came mid rare. I did not finished it, too bloody for me. They have a great selection of good wines and affordable."
Lackluster,"Lackluster service, meh decor, overpriced food. The confit de canard was good, but their pork rack was poorly cooked and 70% fat. With American pop blasting in the background and shabby tables, didn't feel like a French place, but the price was certainly through the roof. The service was passable, but our waitress was utterly disinterested in having customers and perhaps living a life. I still have no idea what I paid for. The whole experience was sub-$20, but we were charged twice that."
Tasty!,Love the place. We had our dinner after my friend ended work. the only concern I have that time was we were not allowed to get food for take away.
signature duck confit the best,"The signature duck confit and saveur past it‚Äôs favorite , most popular item in menu, valuable price and food quality also not bad.... highly recommend for this France restaurant!"
lunch at Saveur on 29 Feb,"6 star for Corrine the service staff @ Saveur. she handled 50 pax singly - welcoming the guests, taking orders, serving and also as a cashier. her demeanour - smiling and patience characteristics overwhelmed my guest and me. food was above average"
Decent value french food,"Dinner for 3 - pate, truffle fries, and foie gras to start. Mains were duck confit and Beef en Cronte. Enjoyed the pate best and confit. Wine corkage was $30 - which was okay considering the house pour was $10 a glass..."
Good food and consistent!,"Good food that you can always rely on, it‚Äôs amazing how they can maintain their quality and price too!"
Did not dissapoint,"We returned here again after a few years for our anniversary. We had the foie gras, onion soup, duck confit and lamb shank, The food is high quality and affordable. Will try the bouillabaisse next"
Can't use vouchers,"Staff said we could not use the chope voucher since we did not inform the restaurant through the ""instructions/comment box"". Nowhere in the T&Cs states that we have to inform when making the reservation -- only need to inform before ordering. Ended up paying cash instead. Food was at most mediocre. Had so much expectation for the $38 steak and man I was truly disappointed. Even Astons offer better steak at a cheaper price. So many things on the menu was not available (all mocktails, creme brulee etc.). Horrible experience. Can't believe I have to go again to actually use up the Chope voucher that I did not get to use this time round."
Saveur‚Äôs not as good as Gunther‚Äôs but better value,"If you crave French food while strolling on Purvis Street but can‚Äôt afford Gunther‚Äôs (in my opinion one of best French restaurants in SG), stop by Saveur, and...dream that you‚Äôre at the former. The standards of cooking and service may not be the same, but it‚Äôs pretty good. If you‚Äôre wildly imaginative, you‚Äôd walk out very happy..."
food was good but service could have been better,"we reached the restaurant 10 minutes before 12PM and the door was not open till the 12PM sharp. There were already many groups of guests then and despite us reaching earlier and there's no formal queue, we were seated much later and our orders were taken down much later despite several attempts to get attention of the waitress. And we have stated that we will be celebrating birthday for one of our friends, and when dessert was served to us, we politely asked if we can cut the cake here, the supervisor of the restaurant said ok but he told us to hurry up as there's a line outside. It was barely 1PM, we thought the default dining time for per group should be minimally 90 minutes. This caught us by surprise, as you decide to open late, we had a reservation, you did not manage your crowd well, and you told us there is a line out there."
"Food is fine, but service not too much","Overall the food is fine. But we seem to be rushed through the whole dining experience. The appetizer, soup and entree all are served within 10minutes. The server saw that we were still eating our appetizer and soup but just went ahead to serve the entree. With a small table and lots of big plates, it‚Äôs just not enjoyable at that point. What more we seem to be rushed off because We were told the next group was already here, even though we were told we had until 815( an hour and 15 minutes of dining). It was a mistake of course we were told after, but the whole experience was just bad..."
Fab!,"Food was amazing, service was relaxed yet on point and atmosphere was terrific. Will certainly be back."
Value for money and good French food,"I ordered the Duck Confit, Mushroom Veloute En Croute, Traditional French Onion Soup, Steak and Fries, and Pork cheek. The standard of cooking was good, and we thoroughly enjoyed the dishes. The plating of the dishes could have been more creative and interesting though. We also had the Chocolate Fondant cake and the Baileys Panna Cotta. The chocolate cake was rich and has the most intense of chocolate favour. The Panna Cotta could have more intense favour though, as the the Baileys' favour did not come through."
Not up to expectation,"I visited Saveur after reading some of the great reviews It had. I was disappointed with the whole experience, specially the food. We ordered the duck confit and entrec√¥te as mains which was very ordinary. Starters were oysters and foie gras. Desert was cream br√ªl√©e. The only acceptable dish was the foie gras.
Will try to find better French food the next time I visit singapore."
Just ain't the same since ownership changed,"For years this had been my favourite restaurant. Always been a big fan of Saveur. Loved the duck confit, the unique Savuer's pasta, and the pistachio panna cotta. But honestly, since the restaurant got sold and new owners took over, there has been a gradual downward spiral in everything. Sure, duck's same recipe, but skin just isn't as crisp, meat not as tasty. Pasta's no longer savoury (what happend to the taste? It's bland now). And don't get me started on my favourite - the panna cotta - it's totally tasteless now even though they tried to jazz it up with Baileys fresh cream on top. But the worst thing of all? The service - why do all the male waiters look so disgruntled all the time? They are responsive but somehow there's never a hint of a smile on the face which makes for an unpleasant dining experience. One female (Philippino?) waitress was the only bright spark in the entire experience - she was polite and cheery. Definitely my last visit to this restaurant, very sadly. A final adieu to my once #1 dining spot :("
Bad,"1. Tiny portions. $50 for a tiny steak and a few tiny slivers of vegetables - embarrassing

2. Poor service with staff who can't smile, seem overly stressed and all about to have nervous breakdowns

3. Horribly bright lights - more like an interrogation than a restaurant

4. Early closing time - 930pm? Really? Staff started banging things 3 minutes after"
French food at good prices,"I love the foei gras and duck confit most. Tasty food at a comfortable setting. They have another branch at Cathay, will try that one day. Will visit again"
Piping hot food and tasty meal,I appreciate that our dishes was prepared on the spot. Even the fries with mussels were piping hot. Very tasty and extremely value for money with 50% Chope voucher with good portion. I would gladly pay for its original price.
GOOD FOOD SUBPAR SERVICE!,"4 stars largely because of food.

Had an absolute lovely dinner. Food was totally on point. Shrimp and baby lobster fettuccine has generous amount of ingredients. Signature duck confit was still as good and the mushroom veloute was so flavourful. The only gripe was what everyone else commented - the service or rather lack of. We were the 3rd couple during dinner service yet the waiter who took my order couldn‚Äôt remember it and sent our order to the next table."
Nice and Yummy Dinner,"Brought my boys to Saveur and they enjoyed it so much . Practically each course of the meal. I ordered the Pork Cheek and it was nice, just that; my preference; the meat a bit too lean hence makes it dry."
Worst Customer service. Left in 1 min,"Saveur. If I could give zero star for its customer service, I would give it. Customer service decides everything. Food is secondary to me. Left the restaurant 1 min after entering. Politely requested a more comfortable table but was rejected by the waiter, Garmesh (not sure about the spelling). The restaurant was only less than 10% occupied and lots of table (not reserved) available. Garmesh rejected us rudely when there‚Äôs empty tables without reservation saying it has to go by sequence??? Such logic indeed. Left there and had dinner somewhere better where I don‚Äôt have to face such attitude as a full paying customer."
1st timer,"Introduced by a friend and surprisingly pretty good. We have their signature plus the chef special, food taste was great!"
Disappointed,"Food and service were disappointing. Used to be much better. Service was slow, even though the restaurant was not crowded. Mashed potatoes was powdery."
Poor customer service,The waiter who served us wasn‚Äôt friendly and poor clarity of speed. We had to ask him a few times before we could understand him.
Interesting french food,I was there with my son and he enjoyed the food very much. Simple decor and value for money set lunch!
Unwelcoming,Person hosting at the front counter was unfriendly even though the restaurant was not busy with only around 30% occupancy . Food is average.
Great food and service,"Had a good experience dining here. The pasta had a generous amount of seafood in it, the mashed potatoes tasted great and the beef was nicely seared. Reserved a table for 3 to celebrate a birthday and they gave us complimentary dessert."
It‚Äôs ok,"Out of curiosity we made a booking. But it was a little disappointing.

In terms of value, if you get a set, it seems a good deal. But in terms of quality of food, it doesn‚Äôt stand out.
Plating left much to be desired. We had the duck confit and the beef.

Service was same standard as food. We were still eating when dessert came. Hahaha.

This place has the right idea. Affordable French food accessible to all. Just need to work on redeemable things to make it a better dining experience.

All the best"
Very difficult to define,"What is the place? Is it a French bistro? A romantic spot? A place for friends to get together? A client entertainment spot. I guess it‚Äôs morphed from one to another throughout its life but hasn‚Äôt really nailed any of them.

The food is good but the experience is very, well, stagnant.

We had couples bunched up next to us so close you could hear intimate conversations, and yet the larger tables next to us were empty.

The lights were so fluorescent bright it felt like being at a hawker centre, and the service, whilst friendly but verging on the incompetent, was only able to say ‚Äòmanagement‚Äô had deemed lighting should not be dimmed or tables should not be moved.

I guess all these items can be remedied as they‚Äôre not out of the ordinary in Singapore, however the value did seem especially high. We paid SGD140 for two courses and a bottle of wine.

We won‚Äôt be coming back for a romantic moment, we won‚Äôt be bringing the kids because the children can‚Äôt be catered, I won‚Äôt be bringing my team for dinner or lunch because it‚Äôs not value for money, and I won‚Äôt be able to bring someone for business as it‚Äôs not good enough to entertain. I‚Äôm therefore at a loss as to what this place is meant to be, apart from being a place for reasonable French food, but there‚Äôs already many more places in Singapore that can cater to that."
A little oily on duck confit,Been a few times but the quality ty of my recent visit was a let down. Duck too oily. Not the usual lightly crisp on the skin
Affordable french cuisine,"We ordered the dinner specials on our 1st visit..we had bought a voucher from Chope but couldn't use it as it was the long weekend holiday for Singapore as it was their national day and Hari Raya Haji...my appy was nice..the beef cheek was delish ...the only letdown was the roasted spring chicken....it was salty...we ordered vanilla creme brulee...it was divine and spot on as we can hear the crackling sound when we tap it with our spoons.... On the 2nd visit, we ordered a salad , duck confit and crab tortelinni pasta and ordered the special chocolate lava cake with housemade vanilla ice-cream for dessert....We didn't regret ordering the choc. dessert ...it was really delish....‚ù§"
Hope for better,It is too sultry inside the restaurant. The food has not meet the previous standard. The waiter is too less but they still manage to serve us well.
It's different,I wasn't particularly wow-ed by the food I'm afraid. The salmon confit presentation was nice and not too bad but the beef cheek was a letdown. The mash potato was dense and the sauce was ok only.
Disappointing French typed food,"Food quality average,
Priced high for freshness and quality of food.
We had mussels which didn‚Äôt was bland ( tasted like frozen seafood)., shrimp cocktail that didn‚Äôt look fresh .
The crab tortellini was too creamy yet lacking in crab flavor.
Ambience lacking , tables packed closer than those st hawker centers .
Priced at least 5 x more than what‚Äôs worth."
Different from the first time,"it has been several years since i last visited Saveur. Loved their Saveur pasta previously. Compared to the previous visit, the food during this visit was only alright. Ordered the saveur pasta, duck confit, sea bass and the escargots. Letdown was the Saveur Pasta which was what drew us there. Very few shrimps and the pasta tasted dry. Duck Confit was still good. Sea Bass was fresh."
"Noisy bistro, ok food, poor service",Went here for a date. The tables are packed tight together but there was no noise cancellation so it's very loud. Food was ok but our starters came out at different times and the main arrived before the starter was finished.
