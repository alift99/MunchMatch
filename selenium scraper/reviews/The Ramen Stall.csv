Poor reservation service,"This was our first time to the restaurant. We made a reservation for 2 pax and we arrived on time. There was a couple ahead of us who didn't have a reservation and they got a table in the restaurant itself (ie air-con). Next was us and I informed the staff that we had a reservation and she said she'd check. She came back and said that they only had tables outside (no air-con but there're fans). Clearly they didn't reserve a table for us and I was very disappointed. The couple that didn't reserve a table got to sit inside but we had to settle for the outside. This just spoilt the whole mood. What's the point of making a reservation when those that didn't, got better seating?

We ordered beef ramen and volcano ramen, chicken gyoza and beef wrapped golden mushrooms. Drinks were sour plum and cold green tea which was a disappointment cuz it was just Pokka green tea (for $2.80). The ramen itself were good, but nothing fantastic. Beef wrapped golden mushrooms were bland, but the gyoza were fantastic. It was so crispy and had nice amount of filling.

Overall, we wouldn't purposely come again unless we're with a group that wanted to eat there."
Great tasting halal ramen.,"friendly staff, great tasting food and in a calm comfortable setting. This is the best tasting halal ramen I have had so far in Singapore."
Good Food but Greeted with Rudeness,"Everything else was great. However we were greeted with this short hair waitress. She was rude and obnoxious. When she showed us to our seats, she yelled at us. Ruined our experience when she quickly clean the table. As if we‚Äôre being shoo‚Äôed away. After the meal, we felt like everything was rubbish. Food great but service ruin it. Other staff were accommodating but just her."
Ramadhan break fast,The ambience was good and ordering was made easy the only downside was the gohan menu came late and my order which was curry rice came at least 5min after the break fast timing while others already had theirs served. Would like to have them at least serve them by break fast timing
Never again,Sick and tired of poor soft drinks selections then refusing to provide tap water unless it's hot or comes in a plastic container. Encouraging destruction of the environment for a significantly overpriced bottle of water probably bottled from tap water anyway. Then continuing to argue about it although we've already ordered 2 premium drinks and $60 worth of food. Absolutely pathetic will never come here again but make your own mind up. Hundreds of better restaurants around here.
Amazing late night delight,"A wide range of options to choose from. It‚Äôs a rarity nowadays to find a place that is open till 2am. The squid, chili crab sushis were good."

A decent Japanese restaurant,The ramen tasted good but it was slightly on a higher price. The restaurant has a nice ambience and the staff was friendly!
A simple and average japanese restaurant. Worth to go only once. Price is quite on the high side for limited choice,There is a limited choice of ramen despite the name of the stall. Was quite disappointed with our ramen as there is barely 2 slices of beef in a bowl. Presentation is good but the price for such portion is quite high. Pleased with my unagi don though.
Volcano ramen,Wonderful ramen broth with springy ramen noodles. 1 of the best that i have tried. I am repeat customer. Definitely have to try it out. Servix emay he a bit slow during rush hour but worth the wait.
A lot of choices,"Halal Japanese food with a lot of variety. We liked their Unagi Don, ikura sushi, and tempura vegetables and soft serve Matcha ice cream."
