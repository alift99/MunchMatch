Was an okay affair,"I think the food was good overall - we had pork knuckle, fish and chips, barramundi and ribeye steak. Think that it was slightly over priced, especially the steak."
Pleasant,Food was good and staff were friendly. We were accorded an indoor table as there were people smoking outside.
Better off somewhere else,"Pork chop was chewy and hard. Spinach was extremely salty. Super understaffed. Avoid at all cost, there are many better options out there at this price range."
nice gula melaka sago ice cream,"overall service was good and the we ordered set lunch, baby back ribs (4/5) and broccoli soup (3/5)
Slightly different concept of set lunch just come with main course, any additional soup/ salad, drinks, dessert have to top up.

The gula melaka sago ice cream is best"
Prime grain fed rib eye steak must try,"Prime grain fed rib eye steak was juicy and tender. Loved the sweet potato fries and the steamed broccoli with almonds and butter, al dente crunch to the broccoli. Service staff were really considerate to half the steak for us as we were sharing.
Brownie was not too sweet and was soft yet chocolate rich"
on the chopping block,"Decided to give this restaurant a shot with dad because we had never eaten here before. The other two choices we were considering was Jamie’s Italian and So Pho. In particular, I picked this over Jamie’s (which we considered a safe and palatable choice) because it also offered burrata, and I was thinking of trying a different take on it.

Initial observations: the restaurant was relatively empty with only 3-5 tables filled when we entered. Dad opted to sit near to the glass panels, and that choice of location apparently rendered us invisible most of the time. The waiters outside couldn’t see us, and neither did the ones inside pay attention to us. We had to wave for a good two minutes before finally we got any attention - and not from anyone inside the restaurant, but the waitress who was bringing in new customers from outside.

First thing I asked for was burrata. The waitress blinked, then mentioned it might not be available. I flinched - then what was I here for? I could get steak anywhere else. And I guess that was the beginning of a bad night. On hindsight, we should have left there and then.

Either way, I stuck to my medium rare steak ($41) and my dad ordered the Berkshire pork chop ($33). It took a little while too long to come. Because I ordered an apple martini along with it, my stomach was burning by the time the food came (LOL). I thought the steak was fine, a little chewy, but not worth $41 by any means. Dad abandoned the pork chop about three-quarters through, declaring he preferred pho. Again, we struggled to get the attention of the waiters and our bill took ages to come. All this while, the Jamie’s Italian sign stood brightly outside the glass panels that separated us from it, as if mocking my choice.

We’re not coming back. Still, I will mention some qualities worth noting, though they don’t redeem the experience. First, the apple martini had some real good kick to it, but considering it’s almost $25 it had better be. Second, their truffle fries are okay. Third, they were playing John Mayer in the background, which makes everything better. But not better than a 2/5."
Delicious meal,"A place I would definitely return for the beautiful ambience, quality food and service. Thank you for service with a beautiful smile, you have made my visit a memorable one."
Lunch menu not for Chope reservation,"These days it is more convenient for diners to make reservation via apps such as Chope instead of calling the restaurant to book. I frequent Chop House for dinner quite often but last week was the first time I was there for lunch. I am not pleased that Chop House does not provide lunch set menu to those who make reservation via Chope. Only Ala Carte orders are allowed. Although I am planning to order steak that is not in the lunch set menu, but I think it is disappointing that Chop House differentiates those walk-in and direct phone reservation vs. reservation via Chope. There isn't a special discount for bookinga via Chope so I am not sure why Chop House makes the differentiation. I have booked many restaurants via Chope or Quandoo before and I never encounter such differentiated treatment for non-discount reservations."
Sumptuous meal❤️❤️❤️,It was a causal family dinner with my hubby and toddler son. We ordered 2 sets of rib eye medium rare. It was nicely done with the red wine sauce. Kiddos!
Great Burgers,"Not sure what type of training the serving staff have had, but our server was slow, not very attentive, polite or easy to understand. We were on a Saturday celebration with my family of four and had we not had ordered drink we would have left. My son didn't understand her asking what 'doneness' he wanted his burger and so she just kept mumbling the same question."
"Good burgers, but atrocious service!","Oh what a shame, terrible service - order taking was painful - poor first impressions, followed by chewy calamari, but thank goodness the burgers were good and tried to overlook the bad start. When the bill arrived, $240 for two starters, 4 burgers, 4 soft drinks and 2 beers, I knew I’d been better off at Hans Im Gluck next door."
Overall ok,My friends and I were walking around looking for a place to dine when we finally decided to dine here. The service is good although there were only one staff that was attending to the diners inside and outside the restaurant (I guess when we are too early not many staffs). I have ordered Baby Octopus Aglio Olio. It was really good although a little spicy for me.
"Suave ambience, epic service","We were just walking past when we decided to have a couple of drinks and a meal. We were served by Shafiq who displayed absolute excellence in service. Very very impressed, will drop by for another beer if we come by anytime soon"
Good steak place in casuala dining bistro,"I made a reservation but was offered a very small table for 2 persons because most reservations are for 3 or 4 persons. It seems like there is no value in reserving a table when allocation of seats is poorly strategised to start with. My husband wanted to leave seeing that we were given the 'naughty table'. Soon, the staff offered to seat us at a proper table. Didn't feel that we are valuable customers.

I loved the steak; the tenderloin is seared to perfection, the pork belly starter is surprisingly good with complex textures with belies its simple presentation.Mac and Cheese is creamy though a bit watery under the cheese crust. Lovely beer at $7 per pint before 8pm. Tap water costs 50cts. Casual ambience with quite a number of families with kids. Volume of music could have been lowered for better conversation. It is hard to locate and contrary to the map that comes with the email confirmation, the bistro is located near the back of the mall, not near the main road.

It's a skeleton crew out there and we had to wave our hands to get their attention for orders."
Dinner catchup with friends,This was a return visit as I had a pleasantly experience the first time round with a group celebrating a friend's birthday. The food was good as usual and the ambience was as cozy as my first visit - the lighting was brighter than the last time thankfully and music selection just as enjoyable. I will definitely want to bring other group of friends back for another visit again.
Not worth to visit,"We visited there as a family lunch with small kid and when we asked plate for the kid to share the food, one of the waitress pointing the kids menu and said ' there'.
We politely asked for the plate for one more time to get a plate. We are not big fan of waisting food and little one won't finish even kid's menu.
After that, we could hear the waitress was talking about us right behind the table and even upon leaving behind the counter. Worst service ever."
Very highly priced meal for nothing,The food was not good. The steak very chewy and no taste. Sides of small salad was really really small. Came home hungry after spending 100$ for two people.
Pleasant experience and decent food,Went there for a business lunch. Tried the US grain fed steak which was good. Also had the gula melaka sago for desert which was also good. Guess you get what you pay for since it is relatively pricey for lunch. They do have set lunches which are much more economical. Worth checking for a special occasion or just to unwind. Has a view of the sea. Option to sit out if weather is good.
Not too bad for casual dining,"Our first impression when we walked into the restaurant was that the music was a bit loud so we asked where the best place to sit if we didn't want the loud music. The attendant took us outside into a corner which turned out to be fine. The food was good. We ordered fajitas and steak and a couple of simple appetizers (French fries and spinach and mushrooms). The beer was good, as we tried both their IPA's. And for dessert we had a banana split. The staff was friendly and the food was good so I can recommend this place to anyone looking for a pretty good Western meal."
Not value for money,"The serving size is very small for the price. The fajitas were burnt, but they did try to replace and also gave complimentary dessert."
A bit disappointed,"Frankly speaking I was a bit disappointed when having dinner with my family on the Labour Day at The Chop House Vivo City. Am quite a careful diner and also quite particular on the sequence when come to serving... The person who took the order from me missed out serving the soup of the day... when I reminded, the waitress then served us the last dish... never mind, the bowl of soup served without a spoon... By the way the restaurant was not full house that evening!"
Nice place for gathering,Friendly and helpful staff; Friend had her 50th birthday celebrated there and all of us had a good time. Friends loved the songs played..
Great service and ambience,"It was a very nice place for birthday lunch. The service were great and attentive. The food was quite average - My seabass was soft but extremely saltish, my colleague's pork chop was tender but the sauce was extremely thick and saltish. For the prices quoted, i would expect better quality. I remembered better food with The Chop House."
Work day lunch,"We took advantage of the work day set lunches. They usually offer a pretty good 2 course or 3 course set lunch during the work week

The menu for this period was pretty fusion. A burnt corn appetizer and a fusion chicken rice appetizer was on offer. I picked the burnt corn appetizer which turn out to be pretty good. It had grill corn with corn purée and also popcorn on top. I had the pork chop which was also pretty good as well."
dinner,"this is under the wooloomooloo group. as a steak lover, i ordered their ribeye and mash potato. food is of good quality."
Cheap Cheap,"Dined here for lunch- for starters, don’t run a Chope lunch deal which isn’t exactly that lowly priced, and have a special menu just for chope- I.e. tiny 3 portions of pork in small buns as your main course. My heart kinda sank when I was presented with a chope menu that was separate to the set lunch menu.
To TOP it all off, we ordered pints of beer over lunch but they still charged us for a bottle of water!"
Service and food was great!,"The service staff were attentive and very friendly. We were sitting at a table underneath a ceiling fan that, when activated, would cause the light above it to keep pulsating, making our dining experience very unpleasant. thankfully, the service staff noticed and turned off the fan without having us tell them. we ended up staying on for dessert as a result :)"
Terrible food,"We waited more than 30mins for the food to arrive.
I ordered a BBC Burger, the beef patty was extremely dry.
My girlfriend ordered the sirloin steak,
They gave the wrong sauce
The Truffle potatoes we ordered for sharing doesn't contain any truffle in it.

The food was incredibly delicious years ago, I am not sure how/why it turned out to be like this.
Now I see why the place isn't filled during valentines day dinner service.
What a disaster."
Lousy service for very average food,Lousy service..waited 40 min for a mediocre steak and mussels. Restauarant was half empty but the waiter insisted that the kitchen was very busy...doing what...i really do not know. But Hey! At least and fortunately the couple who arrived 20 min after us got their food before us. Bravo!
Nice ambiance but food can be improved,"The chicken croquette and soup of the day as starters were good and leaving us with good expectation on the mains... However, the pork belly is really badly seasoned with cheap hoi sin sauce, meat is slightly to the rough side, with dry texture and cold buns. The chop house burger is equally bad with overcooked and lacked seasoning patty, it is so dry that we have to request for extra sauce to gulp it in. Fries is served crunchy and nicely season though."
Continuing the great work over the last 2 years,"Just thought i would update my review posted a few years ago on the Chop House. Over the last few years, they have managed to turn the performance of service and quality from a 1 star to 5 stars.

An absolute please to go to, nice cold peroni, great ribs, great view and attentive, friendly staff.

Please keep up the good work"
Food is good although wait is long,"was there with 5 GF. reserved 5 seats initially but although changed to 6, restaurant claimed they were not informed. in any case we got 6 seats.the wait for the main course was pretty long; however when the food eventually arrived they were good. my well done steak was not well done and had to be sent back; they did return with a better version, still juicy."
Great place to dine ...,"Been to this restaurant a few times already and we enjoy the ambiance, service and food always.

Whilst the prices are not cheap, it is also not extraordinarily expensive. On certain days, it can get pretty crowded but we always manage to get seated within a few minutes. The restaurant offers both indoor as well as outdoor seatings. There is a bar counter for those who drinks.

Overall experience is good, the wait staff are attentive and prompt, and the food delicious."
Great food- excellent service- chop house VivoCity,"Every month among my friends, we take turn to host dinner with wine, we been to many places as the months goes by,This month my turn to host and I have difficulties in deciding where to host it, after much thought I decided to host it in CHOP house(VivoCity), when called for reservation - I specifically stated that I need to have view of the sea and fireworks. On 17th Nov. night - when we turn up in the restaurant all arrangements done with perfection - numbers of seats and positioning of the seats, so that everyone can have the views without obstruction- very thoughtful of the 2 mangers- Faizal & Shafiq,as we are a big group- our orders can be quite complicated especially for the doneness of the steaks with appetizers, drinks and many other special requests,I was wondering how they can cope up?,to our surprise- all were in order exactly what we wanted, food was great and service were beyond excellent- First time in this kind of gathering - I don’t receive complaint not a single remark but full of compliments for the food & service.And I got all the credits for organizing and chosen a perfect venue, I humbly accept all compliments and gladly share with the 2 managers, Faizal & Shafiq and their hardworking staff of CHOP house(VivoCity).
Strongly recommended for future and memorable dining experience- well done - CHOP House - VivoCity! Keep up the good work!

Goh BOCK seng"
Definitely will be back for more,"My second time here with my friend and was surprised that one of the staff remembered us and welcomed us back!!! (I was really surprised)
Food was amazing and the happy hour beers were value for money.
I had Ribeye, It was juicy and perfectly cooked as medium rare (some restaurant doesn't know how to cook medium rare)
My friend had barbeque burger and it was huge!! Juicy and filling..
One of the staff (wear different cloth)drop by and check we are happy with food and drinks which was very rare nowadays.
All in all we had a great time and will definitely be back soon!!!!!"
Terrible service,"In an empty outlet with about 5 staff and about 4 tables to be serve our table is like invisible, not worth to be back here. Sitting outdoors. Slacking so much in service, slow as usual, I’m very sorry but you might look into it. Not only our table is going to the bar side just to get the things we need other guest too. So sad."
Fantastic,"After a really hectic day , we came across this Resteraunt after popping into Vivo city .

Warm welcome and we were seated and served in no time! Food was good...really good .. we had Barrumundi and burgers and we ate it all ..

Our waiter was attentive , the view towards Sentosa was great and the atmosphere was fun! We would definitely come back!

Thank you"
Lovely place for lunch and conversation,"This is my fourth visit and the place does not disappoint. The ambience is good, with a respectable range of drinks. The food is quite fantastic. I especially like the privacy that this place offers for good conversation!"
"Awesome service, great ambience",Great food and the staffs were really helpful with the menu and explanation of the drinks. Wide selection of drinks and the happy hour promotion was really a great factor! Good job guys!
Good steak,"Overall dinner was great. The tenderloin was slightly charred, but very flavourful. The appetisers are nice. However they seems under staffed. The service crews are rushing here & there and no eye contact with customers. Restaurant wasn’t very full & yet no refill of water or time to clear the dishes. Will still visit again as the food is value for money."
Bad service. Steak was burnt,"Restaurant manager who ""welcomed"" us was cold and made us felt as though we shouldnt be there. Almost wanted to walk out immediately but stayed as i didnt want to spoil the mood given that it was a birthday dinner for my son.The same manager took our orders. Was disinterested and was rude in his response when we tried to order some finger food which was not available at that time. Food arrived and the 3 orders of sirloin and ribeye that we ordered were overcooked and burnt on the outside. Overall experience was bad...will not patronise this restaurant ever again."
"Good Steak, Great ambiance, Late closing","We were a bit late coming back from our Batam Tour (9 pm)and were looking for a restaurant that is near. We were able to make a quick reservation with Chop House online as they will still be open up to 11pm. we arrived at around 930pm and ordered sirloin and rib eye steak, steak salad, pasta bolognese, among others. While we were not impressed with the Pasta Bolognese, the steak was pretty good specially the rib eye. They also have a wide variety of beers to choose from and the place is very comfy and quiet. One can sit with a view of the harbor and Sentosa island from a distance."
"Good food, great service.","Initially, we were quite upset as there was a new staff who do not even acknowledge us while waiting just in front of the counter. He was on the phone (taking reservations I think) but he could had smile or signal another staff to attend to us.

However, once seated, another of their staff, great service level, attended to us and gave some recommendations.

Ended up delighted as the after-counter service was excellent and the food was delicious!

Must try the Rib Eye and mussels!"
Good food but slow service,"We went with a group of eight for lunch this week. The lunch menu is good and a decent deal. The service however is not trying to do a particularly good job. Not attentionate, slow and undynamic."
Worst Experience!!,"This is not the first time, The worst service I have had in SG. The restaurant was not even busy and the staff cannot handle the order load. We were 4 patrons, waited 20 minutes with one meal on the table before I had to call someone to find out where the rest of the food was. food still arrived at the table in pieces, it was cold, the quesadillas were burnt and cold with only a teaspoon of each of the side condiments. When we ordered any food or drinks it took between 20 and 30 minutes for it to arrive. When we did order draught they brought the wrong ones to the table, after asking for them to be changed and 20 minutes and nothing the men drank them. Their service was totally and utterly disgusting and the fact that I am forced to pay a service charge for such crap service should be illegal. I would not recommend anyone to go the chop house unless you want crap food crap service and get over charged."
Food was good,Was there to celebrate my spouse’s birthday and we think the food was good. We enjoyed the ribeye and salmon steaks. Will be back!
Chop House Vivo City Singapore,It is a nice place to have a taste of the various range of craft beer... Price is quite reasonable...
Good Service & Good Steak,"There are indoors (air-conditioned) and outdoors seating options. Outdoor seating is next to the water with views of RWS in Sentosa Island.

Staff is attentive to reservation details. Service was good, with supervisor checking-in on dining experience midway through our meal.

Ribeye steak were done to almost perfection (medium rare, in our instance). Truffle fries tasted good, albeit serving size is small. Sautéed spinach and mushroom is tasty but done with too much cream or cheese, making the side dish a tat heavy.

Ambience is good for casual dates, family (children friendly) and small gathering of friends. We will return to try other dishes, and perhaps alcoholic drinks."
Good food,"Steak was done to my likely, and the sides (mushroom, broccoli) were great. Fries and broccoli were a bit salty though. Music was a bit loud but was told they cannot adjust the volume. When return when I crave for steak."
"Good food, good ambience",We were looking for a new steak house where we can enjoy a decent steak and ribs. This place did not disappoint. Their Australian grass fed tenderloin is one of the best we had at Singapore while their baby back ribs is good too. The corn soup and Long island tea were very good.
Nice lunch sets,"Been here twice, am quite happy with their lunch sets - I've taken the beef bourguignon and soup both rounds. Very affordable, not many people so getting a seat is easy.

Would recommend this to people working in the area needing a nice lunch and not too noisy environment to talk."
Enjoyed the quiet ambience,"Enjoyed a nice beef burger, tasty and the beef patty was done to perfection but the fries were a little salty. My friend said the fish and chips were average. Nice and quiet place to chill, I liked the ambience, and prompt and attentive service but the food was a little pricey. Might come back again to try their wide selection of beers."
Nice restaurant but food service was slightly slow,Ordered the fathers day lunch set. The appetizer took about 45 mins before serving even though the restaurant was rather empty. The 4 person table is also slightly small.
Excellent place for dinner and drinks,"Great happy hour deal, solid good food, decently priced and nice ambient. Great for dates or family gatherings"
Pork ribs tasted different and awful,"Having been to this restaurant for the countdown dinner in 2017, the food quality was stellar and most of the dishes were good like the pork chop and the pork ribs.

Therefore, we paid this place another visit but was very disappointed with the pork ribs. The taste this time was very different and the ribs had an overwhelming porky taste. Similarly, the truffle fries this round was not as nice as before. The potato in the fries was “powdery” and no truffle taste at all."
"Good food, average service","*I was there for a dinner, 2 pax, on a Fri evening, damage was about S$80.

Good
- The food! We had a beef salad, a fish main, and 2 sides (creamed spinach and mac & cheese). All were done well.

Can be better
- Service. Was a bit of a challenge to get them to refill our water, get the bill, so on and so forth."
small servings HUGE PRICE,"This is our first visit to the restaurant. We ordered the baby back ribs ($48 for 2) and the mixed seafood grill ($62 for 2) to share among the four of us. The baby back ribs was good, but servings were barely enough for 2. The mixed seafood grill was especially miserable......there were just one small piece of salmon fillet, 3 small mussels, 3 small prawns, a small handful of calamari and one grilled tomato.....meant more for one person. We are not big eaters but were really disappointed that the restaurant choose to stinge. Even wine by the glass was barely half-filled. Service is decent.....but definitely not recommended if you want to have a satisfying meal."
Great Service! Great Food! Wonderful Staff!!,"We love Chop House! We go there all the time! The staff are extremely lovely and attentive! Especially Jega and Ferdie!!!! They always take care of us, and take the time to ask about our day. And they know our drinks by heart! Also, the food is delicious! Their rewards program is also wonderful! I think we have gone through three cards! Take the time and try this place out! You might see us there!!!!!"
Lunch,Not a good service slow even went on lunch time mostly empty tables we ordered steak and baby chicken almost 1 hr wait until food arrived and portioning is small... 1 for 1 happy hour is good deal that make us stay longer... place ambience good..
Great value and great service,"Visited the Chop House for lunch and took advantage of their set lunch 2 course meal deal for $15.80 pp.

Started with soup of the day, which was tomato with croutons, and then indulged with Beef Bourgignon which was succulent, in a delightful jus resting on a creamy mash. Superb serving for a set meal.

The service was first class with helpful, efficient staff and the background classic rock soundtracks made it a perfect stop off for a chilled lunch in a very busy mall.

Highly recommended."
Quality and quantity delivered with lovely service,"Great no fuss chill out weekend spot! Love how they will accommodate you even without a reservation when they are busy.
We dined here for the first time when my other half was craving for lamb shank. Verdict was that it was one of the very best.
No compromise on serving the best quality. The second time there, we were greeted with a “welcome back” and also when I was going for the shrimp dish, the service staff was honest and kind enough to share that they were not fresh to serve.
Lovely and also attentive service by all. Special thanks to the gentleman Jega for his hospitality. Our dishes were superb as well. I normally wouldn’t order fish and chips at a restaurent but during one of my visits I did and it’s definitely one of the must tries.
Personally the Vivo outlet is where we frequent. But the 112 Katong is intimate as well."
The food and wine are quite good!,"Good view! The lamb chop and wine are very nice, and their service made this meal even more pleasant! I’m a regular customer and will come back again!"
Great food and excellent service!,"We had our dinner here on Sunday. It was our first time here. I was searching for places that serve steak or burger as one of our friend is preparing for a strongman competition and he can only eat meat We ordered a burger, fish and chips, and another fish (I can’t remember the name though and it’s not on the online menu). Overall, we enjoyed our dinner. It was quiet in the steak house, so we were able to have nice conversation among us. Food is reasonably priced too.

I would totally recommend this place ☺️

*Ps: they forgot to key-in our order for Deep fried calamari but they served it to us anyway, and took it off the bill. Thank you!"
Excellent,Food was delicious and cooked to perfection. Good menu selection. Staff were great and spoke good English.
Dating,Their staffs are able to speak in fluent English. We have our good time at The Chop Houese due to their friendly staff and excellent service provided by Jega and Ferdil. Definitely will recommend this restaurant for my family and friends.
Dinner,Their food really taste good and service also very nice. Excellent service from Jega. Staff are all very friendly.
#Good restaurants,"I weekly dine in this restaurant, their cousins and desserts are fantastic. I highly recommend here for everyone. And I highly appreciate Jaga for his assistant in this restaurant."
Visited during restaurant week,"It's my 3rd time dining here and it's for Restaurant Week in March 2018.
Food was decent since I ordered the Prime Ribeye (upgraded for $10++).
Drinks werent included hence I ordered an Apple Martini, and my partner ordered a Lychee mocktail. There's Al Fresco dining if you prefer to be closer to the harbor area which overlooks to Sentosa. Would be good if you go around late 7pm to early 8pm and dine slowly. You may be able to catch the mini fireworks from USS if you are lucky :)"
Nice place to visit with good food,"Had a chance to eat at this place during restaurant week (just ended) in March and the food generally is good. We were trying to read other reviews to see what to try. My husband and I generally order two different dishes to try out. The soup was good (creamy cauliflower veloute), next was the appetizers (thai chicken salad and patatas bravas), both were really yummy! We ordered the USDA Prime Ribeye (We topped up $10++) but was a little sad cos the doneness was correct but overall, the steak feels quite tough still.. not sure why. The saving grace for this dish was the sauce and it was tasty!

The other main course we ordered was the lamb shank and it was served on a bed of mash potatoes and it was really delicious! The meat peeled off easily from the bone and is really good.

Finally comes dessert where we had the hot chocolate brownie with ice cream which is quite average and the sago gula melaka which is really unique and nice! Should try!

Overall, it was a nice place to eat and the service of the staff is quite good too!"
very average,i dont think there any reason for me to return.. had meat platter and fish. very bland. maybe they are healthy. i dont know but not my kind of food.
Birthday celebration,"Nice service staff makes our dinner really nice and comfortable. Steak was cooked the way we want it to be, portion is a little big for me but it was ok. Wine selection was good too."
Once in a bluemoon,"Place is nicely located and wasn't very hot in the evening at the outdoor seating. Very chilling and have a happy hour promotion from 3pm to 7pm. Price wise was slightly above average, and the food portion was just nice. The only disagreement i got was the portion of the green given on each plates. It's not very hard/cost too much to put more green for your guest. All I have was meat. Maybe can take that into consideration. Else, food was nice, and the waitress that serves us has a big smile on her face. Too bad I didn't managed to ask for her name. You guys did a great job in service, will definitely come back next time."
Saved by the opening hours and service,"If not for it's full day opening even after 2pm, this may not have been one of my preferred steakhouse. No qualms about the staff service as they have been quite attentive and polite. The steaks, however, were over-cooked. At over 70 bucks per person for lunch with one of the toughest steaks we've had, we didn't think it was worth it. The mussel soup was quite nice though."
Dinner at Chop House (Vivo),"The recommended BBC beef burger was tasty. General dim lighting makes for a romantic atmosphere, but bad lighting for taking pictures. Service was alright and I would recommend it to a friend."
Bday celebration,"Overall experience was good. They even remembered and surprise the birthday boy. However, even with reservation there was a Long queue created outside but there were no one attending to it. There was no waiter at sight. For your consideration on more hires. Thanks!"
Good ambience and good food,It was my first visit to the Chop House and it exceeded my expectations with really awesome ambience and good food! Definitely going again!
Late lunch,We visit this restaurant for late lunch. They have smoking area! And outside seat more for chill. It was good steak.
Average Food- service intermittent,"Having lived in the US for 4 years then I got to eat in a mix of steak and burger restaurants which in the whole were good.
Chop house I was told was good for burgers and steaks but I wanted lunch so opted for the former.
Overall the burger was average - well cooked but a little bland despite the large amount of BBQ sauce lashed on it. Felt like the latter was an attempt to cover up the former.
Two other things disappointed me -

1)In a restaurant that serves meat to have only Dijon mustard is criminal.

2)The service was a intermittent - it seemed at one point it was more important to take a phone call than serve me. Whilst I know I am not the centre or attention they could have responded more effectively and quicker. They were however very quick to clear the table.

I came with high expectations and was left very underwhelmed. For $30 ++ for a burger I believe there are probably better options."
Steak was small,"Steak was small & pricey, mac & cheese was good tho. happy hour is a gimmick cuz the drinks were just diluted.."
over price and over rated restaurant,"brought my family of 4 for dinner on 27/1, spend SGD 197 for 3 sides and 4 mains, no soft drink, beer, wine nor dessert. steak served was a little small, under char, quite cold, overall the portion is small. the truffle fries cost me $8 for just like Mcdonald medium size fries, especially would like to highlight one of the side dish ""pork belly"", it cost me SGD 18 for 3 little bun wrap with less than an inch thick of port meat"", I measured the dimension was 2"" by 1.5"" size.

worst is the billing was kind of cheating to me. I have purchased a SGD 50 worth of chope voucher, not sure how they use the voucher? I thought the voucher amount should be deducted from my bill first. my bill is nett 168,after the gst and 7% service, the total is $197.8. the restaurant deducted the $50 from the total amount. I thought it suppose to deduct the $50 from the $168 first (this was the amount of all the food I ordered) than add on the 7% and service charge to the amount $118.

Anyway, it was not value for money, I wont go back again."
Quiet eatery with attentive staff,Went for weekday dinner.. enjoyed our time with good food and attentive services. Would highly recommend this restaurant!
Not worth the trip,"We paid $106 for 2 steaks, 1 side and 1 dessert. Price wise may seem reasonable on the first glance but the steaks were really small and of laughable quality. The steaks were so chewy and hard that we had a really difficult time trying to finish off our meat. Safe to say I would never return."
First experience of Chop House,"The name of the restaurant caught my eye when I was looking for a place to celebrate my husband's birthday and the kids want have some ""meat"" for some reasons. The photos on the restaurant's webpage also looks tempting. And it didn't disappoint - the crispy salmon I had was done just right. The birthday ""boy"" shared his BBQ back ribs with my 2nd son and they both enjoyed it... the meat was tender and slips out from the bone easily. My eldest like his grass fed tenderloin medium rare and he likes it very much. The rest had pasta and fish & chips. On the whole, everyone enjoyed their meals. However, I understand the restaurant is under the Australian Wooloomooloo group, so I would expect the food servings will be like the Aussie style - big... but to my surprise, the sirloin steak was smaller than expected. Even the baby back ribs' portion which was to be shared, it may not be enough if the 2 person sharing are big meat eaters :) Service-wise, probably they are shorthanded that evening and we were seated outdoor so we didn't managed to get their attention half the time. But the staff were friendly and helpful - would say above average actually."
Happy Hour,Nicely located after shopping at the mall. Sat outside by the sea front with harbour view over looking Sentosa and cable cars. Prices for Happy hour was reasonable. Two large beers for $18 plus tax and service charge.
Great place poor food,"Have been visiting monthly for a while, the grill platter was the worst I have had ordered medium rare for both lamb and beef. Beef was charred outside and chewy, lamb was under flavoured.
On the bright side, bottle of wine was great as always, staff were friendly atmosphere was great for hanging out."
The steaks are just as you would expect - just perfect.,"Busy and likeable restaurant at Vivo city mall / Vivo waterfront Promenade. Whilst there is a little too much subued lighting (it was almost dark), and the heavy rock could do with being a notch lower. On the other hand the service and the food were particularly good. A nice place for a splurge, and the steaks are just as you would expect - just perfect."
Good meat place,"The meats at this place is very good and surprisingly so is the pasta. Beware of the happy hours and drinks promotion - one can be tempted to keep ordering and before you know it, the bill adds up. Staff are friendly and approachable."
Lunch Set,Lunch set is around 20. no dessert (but they haven't updated their menu); main course is normal. it's not impressive but still acceptable. the good thing is that the restaurant is quiet.
"Good food, great service.",Good ambience with friendly accommodating stuff. Decent steaks at reasonable price. Good ambience and on the outdoor porch for a relaxing meal.
Good as always,Proper restaurant with focus on meat. Great service. Good view. The steaks are very good. Good happy hour deal
Slightly under valued,"ordered bbc burger, fish and chips and mushroom and toast. Burger bun was dry, also meat patty was also dry and lack flavour. Fish and Chips were below average, fish was dry. Only good item was the mushroom and toast"
Yummy!,Succulent beef served in a nice-looking restaurant. It was a pity service was too slow in a moderately crowded restaurant.
"Friendly service, nice Christmas dinner","Chop house has been our regular burger & beer joint for over an year now as we live very closeby.
We invited some friends over to join us for a christmas dinner and all our friends were impressed by the warmth & recognition shown by the crew. They made us look very important as everyone on the team dropped by to say hello and wish us merry christmas! Food was good as well. We tried the roasted quail and lobster mac & cheese from their specials which were yummy.
It was one of the best christmas dinners we have had, it was a dinner with friends served and pampered by friends at Chop House. Thank you so much and wish you all a lovely merry christmas!"
"Decent food, excellent desserts","Nice place, excellent crew. EPL is shown. Good beer too. Food - my friends liked Steak. I went for vegetarian pasta. What impresses most is their desserts:damn good - my fav is Coconut Brioche"
Inconsistent food quality,"My first visit in November was impressive. Set menu courses were freshly served and cooked to a good standard. It was from this experience that I decided to recommend this place for our team Christmas lunch. However, the main dishes served this time were not up to standard. The sirloin steak, pork chop and fish were all over-cooked to a point that made the meat texture very rough and burnt. We got there around 12.30pm and the place was packed with lunch goers, but that doesn’t justify the food inconsistency. I hope the next experience will be a better one."
"Attentive staff, great pre and during dinner service","I made a reservation online with them for my partners’ birthday dinner and requested for my courses to be pre-ordered beforehand as well as a surprise birthday candle after dinner.

Store managers were extremely prompt in acceding to my requests and replying my email. Email exchange was clear, concise and fuss-free.

During dinner service we were served attentively and the food came on a consistent and timely basis. Prime Ribeye Steak was yummy and the brownies were the densest ones I’ve ever had(HIGHLY RECOMMEND) (Other food: Beef goulash, spinach and mushrooms)

Thank you for the great service! I will not hesitate to recommend you to my other peers in the future!"
Average,"The food is decent, nothing spectacular about the offerings. They charge you for table water, which I find absurd. They seem to specialise in burgers, and I had the chicken bacon guac burger. The bun was of good quality, the marriage of the flavours was not bad but the food was a tad salty for my liking. The barramundi fish was too small in portion for the price. The standard has certainly dropped frok my last visit since a good while back. This place seems like a great place for a gathering of friends if you enjoy alcohol though!"
Quality Steak,"If Steak is your deal, The Chop House is the place to go. I found out about The Chop House from The Smart Local's review and was dying for some good steak. I shared a Meat Platter with my friend and the steak did not disappoint as it practically melted in my mouth. The lamb on the other hand was a little too fatty for my liking as the fat was not chewable and I gave up on those portions. The portion was too small to be shared by two to be honest. The meat was accompanied by vegetables but I wished that there was Carbs included like French Fries. I will be having Steak only on my next visit."
Great Ambience and Food,"The rib-eye steak and truffle fries were tasty. The steak was juicy and tender, and the fries had the right texture when chewed."
Great food & service,"I’d booked a table for 5 for dinner and for some unknown reason, a table only suitable for 4 was reserved for us instead. Thankfully, the manager resolved the issue with no fuss and that set the tone for an unexpectedly great meal and overall experience. The food was great especially the main courses - the pork chop (yums!) & steaks in particular. There’s no denying what a great manager can do to the overall running of a restaurant. Well done The Chop House!"
