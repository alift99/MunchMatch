By and large average,Dropped by for a business lunch . They have a $16 lunch menu which consist of appetiser/main or main/dessert. Average food and service
Armando,He is amazing. Good character. Explained all the meals to us properly. Well spoken. Good food!!! For sure we gonna come backkkk
"Thank you, Armando!","My kids planned a surprise birthday party for me. I was told Armando was very helpful and responsive
during the planning stage. Last night, at the actual party, I was very impressed by Armando's great hospitality and the party was a great success! I was very touched and thankful to everyone, especially Armando's great service to my kids' request and during the party.
Thank you, Armando!"
Unfortunate experience - $2 per glass of water despite ordering drinks.,"My husband and I had invited our friends who were visiting Singapore from New York to this restaurant for lunch and we were a party of 4. We ordered a drink each and 3 starters and a couple of main courses. The food that we ordered was presented well and tasted fine.
The service though was sketchy. When asked to recommend a starter the server was clueless. We asked for a risotto later and were told it was not available. Again, we asked the server to recommend an alternative and he was unsure of what to recommend. We ordered a dessert to share as well.
The worst bit was when we asked for TAP water after the meal. They said they'll charge us $2. They didn't tell us the water was free flow. My mistake was that I assumed it was $2 per bottle of water.
I didn't realize until the next morning when my husband gave me the bill that they had charged us $8 for 4 glasses of water! I have sent a message to the restaurant asking them why I was charged this ridiculous amount for water despite ordering drinks before the meal. My friends from overseas were aghast that we were charged for tap water and said we shouldn't leave any tip for the dismal service we received. Unfortunate experience and I would not recommend this place to anyone."
Excellent service!,"We were served by Armando and were very well served. He always checked on us to see if we needed anything.

Cheers to you!"
Smoked Salmon,Tried the smoked salmon tartine for the first time here and it was worth every bite! Kudos to the chef and the entire team at Beast and Butterflies
Beast which isn‚Äôt a beauty,Poor service and bad attitude staff Many better places to visit in Robertson quay Surprising to see them still open Need to train their staff ‚Äòmahesh‚Äô who‚Äôs too lazy to serve customers
Great place,"Food was great, service staff is nice and friendly. Great ambience to gather. Will definitely visit again."
feedback,"we were still hungry after eating our salad despite the price the service was not really professional, they send me the bill twice, and they served me the ice cream when I was changing my baby‚Äôs diaper, so it was liquid when I came back"
Not very professional,"You must order your food via The QR code. After you have done this, a waiter comes to your table asking if he can take the order. Looks like the system and the waiters are not in sync. Not professional. I asked for a glass of water after I ordered +80 SGD dinner. Guess what? They asked 2 dollars for it. Shame you Beast and Butterflies. Penny wise and pound foolish."
Nice food terrible service,"Walked in told to scan menu then waiter walked off, got staters half way through one of the mains turned up asked why it was so soon shrug of the shoulders was the answer. As soon as I finished my meal someone took away my plate leaving my wife feel as tho she was eating on her own. Food was very nice but service horrendous as the 3 star review. Place would be great with some leadership"
A moment in time as it felt,"Relaxed as it comes ( it appears that for some reason I need to say more but think I said enough with out saying to much, that's what it is)"
Good ambiance,"The place is clean and peaceful, you can relax and enjoy. Even the staffs are approachable. Kindly visit"
Review for MSocial,Staff was very friendly and accomodating. Place was relaxing and tidy. Would recommend if you are planning to go on Singapore.
Delicious food and cosy atmosphere,The restuarant is really cosy for online meetings before dinner. The food as usual was tasty and declicious!
OK for Sat night dinner,"We came here for Saturday night dinner, felt the dishes were soso (we got nasi goreng, the burger, beef ribs), except for the Claypot rice that was really nice. The atmosphere was classy too (a tad too dark we couldn't see what we were eating?) but the classy atmosphere was slightly let down by staff service as our table was way too crowded with dishes and too few staff to help clear the plates. Would like to give our compliments to Vaishu for her great waiting service and very friendly attitude though, thank u for serving us."
"Cosy ambience, nice food, excellent service",Was here for a dinner gathering with good friends on a Fri evening. Noted the warm cosy ambience immediately. Menu is limited but we were pleased with our food choices. Food was delicious and came fast. Excellent service from the attentive staff. Special shout out to server Armando who knew his wines well and recommended us a solid Sancerre.
Lunch,"The service and one if the best coffee in Singapore. Ask for Fiona.
Beautiful ambience and most courteous staff"
Very good value lunch menu,"We had the 16 dollar 2 course lunch menu which was very good and great value in Singapore ( for western food). The beer and wine were very good value as well so no complaints from us!
The service was good an¬£ the staff were helpful.
We will go again but try the full menu."
Good experience at Beast & Butterflies,"Good outdoor area, nice ambience, good food, average price, service is Ok. Overall fine. Second time here. Unfortunately, no more daily promotions even if it still advertised on chope."
Lazy afternoon ü´∂,"Love the ambience here ‚Äî my family and I have come multiple times in both the afternoon and evening because it‚Äôs open, airy, and relaxing.

Staff are friendly (especially Fiona, who has served us multiple times as well) and the food is good (try the burrata and beef dishes!).

Overall, always a hit!"
Refuses to honour advertised offers,Advertised an all-day Father‚Äôs Day menu which was exactly what we wanted but then refused to serve it and insisted we order from the brunch menu. Won‚Äôt be bothering them with our business again.
Beast & Butterflies,Nice ambience and yummy food. Great service by Joshua. Worth dining here. Will definitely return again.
Good food and vibes,"Good food and drinks. Nothing too special, but not at all disappointing. Worth it if you compare it to the nearest restaurants around."
Beast and Butterflies delight,It was a joyous birthday celebration with good company and delicious food. The free flow is strongly recommended!
Go it will NOT disappoint,From start to finish absolutely amazing and affordable. Service was on point and food I couldn‚Äôt recommend enough. I‚Äôve been on holiday travelling the world and this is one of the best restaurants I‚Äôve dined in
Food is amazing Best Customer Service,"Love this place very chill, food is amazing and price are reasonable. Good Customer service from Armando! We'll be back every week."
Best Customer Service,"Armando is really nice and friendly, will definitely come back and recommend this place! Best brunch and freeflow"
Amazing food and service,"Second visit here! Love the food here, both the western and local cuisine were really yummy!!

Most importantly, the service staff, Fiona, is very friendly and gives expert food and drinks recommendations.

10/10 would recommend my friends and family to come here :)"
Good.,"We were there for lunch. The service must improve. The staff seemed indifferent, and this is a shame.

The food was not bad. Not outstanding, but not bad at all"

ü¶ã Weekend brunch here is amazing!,"Beast and Butterflies is great! Atmosphere is chill and cool, and the staff is also really friendly. Special shout-out to Armando and Junho! They know what they‚Äôre doing and what they‚Äôre talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy is their main priority. Food is pretty good, asian fusion twists, and for their prices it‚Äôs 100% worth it."

Great ambience & Oysters on Friday nigh t& Amazing service!,Excellent service and attention to detail by Fiona the manager. Their oyster Friday night @$ per pc1 is value for $$ and I also tried their wagyu beef pasta. It was yummy. And Fiona was so kind to give me a complimentary tonic Berry drink with it to pair my pasta! Thank you Fiona!
Excellent all day coffee and meal stop by riverside,"Stopped here for coffee and Cake one morning. Modern and very clean. We chose down the side street in the shade.
Returned a couple of days later for evening meal. Our host was the best!
Chocolate pudding was the best I have ever tasted!!
Definitely recommend Beast and Butterflies"
Fun cocktail making workshop!,We had a fun time learning how to make cocktails with Fiona! Session was interactive and we each got to make our own cocktail concoction.
Excellent Service,"Armando was very attentive, ensuring our wine glasses are filled and food are served. This being my first visit, he really made"
Their service is amazing,"Firstly, the foods are so amazing and affordable!! Also, I‚Äôm impressed with their service, especially the server, Armando.
I will definitely come back here again"
Coming here for the first time,"Service was impeccable. Our server fiona was very welcoming. The food was incredibly delicious and unlike any restaurants' I've tasted. Food arrived quickly as well.
Great environment, great service staff. Highly recommended."
Cocktail workshop,"The workshop was amazing! Learn many new things about cocktail and my drinking taste, got to experience and enjoy different cocktails too"
"Friendly Bartender Fiona, Thank you! :)",Thank you Fiona for such a fun and spontaneous session :) we really enjoyed ourselves and got to find out on the kind of drinks we really like.
Super Interactive and Fun Mixology Workshop,"Highly recommend for those who are a fan of cocktails to make their own here! Tailored to meet your scents, the end product is definitely sure to your liking! We had a great time making our own cocktails!"
Service staff are super friend and nice!,"Visited this place many times. Their service staff are the ones whom facilitate my return always due to their very friendly service especially from Armando (a lovely male staff) who is very attentive, replenish lots of ice for me (I need alot of ice), he remembers me second time he saw me (I've been here many times and each time was serve differently, some serve me multiple times, some once, some twice). I was surprised that Armando still remember me even though it has been 3 months since he last saw me (maybe I make an impression as I needed a huge quantity of ice for my beverages). Everyone of them, a lady who always tie her hair (introduce me wine), a thin tall guy (whom introduce me to a cocktail who is not on their menu), Armando (super friendly persona, energetic, happy). This place has cocktails/food that are not available on the menu, so just asked if they have anything you want. Although to be very honest, I don't think their food are nice. The place is nice to chill at, extremely good service"
Mixology workshop,"Session was great. Learnt a lot bout cocktail mixing and creating our own cocktail. Fiona, our workshop instructor was very nice and we had a great time at the workshop. Thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

Thank you so much for assisting us today. It‚Äôs our first Valentines and I‚Äôm just so grateful to be served by someone as cheerful and kind as you. May your supervisor see the value you add into this business. To all the staff of Beast and Butterflies, thank you all for your service. You are doing a wonderful job! God bless! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Beast and Butterflies - Amazing experience,"Our server, Arnando was such a blast to be with. He serve us with such passion and always joking with us. Paired with such great food, we are truly blessed to spend our valentines' day here."
Service,"Please visit Beast and Butterflies and look for Armando!
Armando is gives the best service!
Would absolutely recommend!"
Impressive service by Armando,"Impressive service by Armando. He is alert, attentive and very welcoming.
Food wise, oysters are fresh and pork knuckle is good. Not impressed by the risotto served this time round though. Salmon and Alaskan crab salad is nice though."
Dinner,Armando is attentive and alert to patrons‚Äô requests and demand. He would do recommendation as well when our wine is running low. Thumbs up for the services provided by him.
Lovely ambience but otherwise fairly average,"We ate at Beast & Butterflies on a Thursday evening in February and left baffled by its high position in the TripAdvisor rankings. The ambience of the place is fantastic, with lava lamps and comfortable sofas, but the rest of the experience didn't meet the same standard.

The woman who served us was very friendly and polite but somewhat disorganised (e.g. offering desserts before clearing the mains; providing details of a wine promotion some time after we'd arrived; not being properly familiar with the menu).

The food was okay but nothing more - the quinoa salad starter was very salty and oily, while a grilled asparagus side dish was overpriced (three spears for $6) and tasted as though it had been cooked on an unclean grill. The wagyu burger was delicious, however, and the chicken hotpot was decent value if unremarkable. The creamed spinach side was also good, as was the lobster bisque starter.

B&B's high positioning in the TripAdvisor rankings conspired against it by setting expectations that it ultimately couldn't meet. Lovely decor but distinctly average food."
Lunch at Beast and Butterfly,"Very accommodating staff, and friendly. Knows the menu items and able to recommend better choices of dish. Coffee ordered was well prepared as per my request."
Good service & tasty food,"Armando was very friendly and helpful, he knows the food well and recommended the Beef Short Ribs.

Kudos to his superb service"
My Thursday Night Fix,Great atmosphere. Delicious food. The wine I needed today - perfect. Friendly staff. I will be back soon
Great Thursday dinner and excellent service with Armando !,Fantastic setting and complimented by very patient service staff named Armando who also ensured we understood how the 1 for 1 wine deal works! Would definitely visit again!
Wonderful experience,"This was my second time dining at this restaurant. The food was excellent and I was blown away by the quality of the services. Special shoutout to the staff that worked so hard on Friday - Armando, Fiona, Clarence and Josh. Thanks for making our birthday party so special. You guys were incredible and the restaurant was lucky to have such a good team. We will come back again!"
Rekindled Date night,"We used to come to B&B very often b4 covid. ""Rekindled"" our visit on 18th Jan 22 and we are reminded why we love this place. So we are back 3 days later with the kids and enjoyed our pork knuckle and bordeaux red, well recommended by Armando. He has been most helpful in giving us recommendations on the menu as well as helping us sign up for A La Carte membership, which is really worth it!

Will be back for sure!!"
Beast and Butterflies,"Good food, Great Ambient and Fantastic Service. If you met a friendly macho guy there, he is likely to be Armando. üòÅ üòÅüòÅ"
beast&butterflies,Armando was so nice and friendly!! Made our dining experience so pleasant :) food is good too and reasonably priced
Wonderful and pleasant dining experience,The service was good and food was tasty. Armenido was friendly and knowledgeable in sharing with us how to determine if the wine was good (i.e. from the cork) and his personal reviews of those wine that we had chosen. Thanks to him for a wonderful dining experience.
Great service and food,It‚Äôs rare to get great service in Singapore but this place delivers. Thanks Armando for being a great server! The food was delicious too. The half mile platter was beautifully presented and good value.
Armando excellent service,13 Jan 2022. An exceptional hospitality by Armando. Great personality and very friendly. A gem in the service industry.
"Wonderful food, excellent service","It was my first time at Beast and Butterflies, and I was truly impressed by the quality of food, wine, and the level of service by Armando, our server. Surely a place I will be returning to!"
Upsetting and horrible,"Would give a lower rating honestly. Atrocious customer service despite the food being excellent; would never go back solely due to the horrible customer experience.

First, the hostess was clueless and spent a lot of time on some customers with NO reservations rather than taking us, as we had made advanced reservations. Then, the manager (? not so sure who he is), kept trying to kick us out, telling us to sit elsewhere as there were so many reservations they couldn't fit us in. Even though we showed him our reservation. Furthermore, he threw his part-timers under the bus and said ""they're just part-timers they don't know anything."" The part-timer actually assured him that we specified our seating in the reservation, while he was being absolutely awful trying to kick us out/ seat us at the BAR COUNTER.

Next, it was hard to get the servers attention. They also kept coming up to remind us several times our duration of stay. (We had 2 hours but they kicked us out after 45 min...) The SECOND we got our bill, the server came up to us and asked us to leave as ""there were so many reservations"", the place was empty. I understand there are reservations (I was a server at a bar before too). However, it's absolutely vile to kick out someone as soon as they've paid.

Very upsetting encounter here. Would NEVER come back; nice place but their employees are vile."
Rude restaurant service at Beast & Butterflies,Went to Beast and Butterflies to request for disposable utensils but front host Armando was very rude and sarcastic. Not what someone in the service line should be. Wanted to have dinner there since we staycay-ed @ M social but was turned off
New Year Dinner,"Great experience with great food.
Accommodating and friendly staff Armando never failed to give his best service during our dining experience. Keep it up gurl! :)
Truly recommended."
New Year‚Äôs Eve,"Armando‚Äôs a very good waiter and made us feel right at home , loved his service! Thank u for the great time!"
Casual Lunch,"Great food and drink at a reasonable price, and a great location to sit outside and watch the world go by"
Cocktail Session at Beast & Butterflies,"Our experience at Beast & Butterflies was really great! We had a fun cocktail making session (booked together with the hotel room package) with bartender Fiona - she was really familiar with the art and was eloquent in explaining the different spirits/mixers to us. She was really friendly as well! We were able to choose our own favourite spirit and mixers to craft a drink suited to our own preference, and I think that was really nice. My partner and I also received a complimentary cocktail shaker to bring home!"
FESTIVE Brunch,"The ambience, food, and service was great. Armando makes our dining experience fantastic, he is friendly and attentive."
Utterly disappointing experience,"I went with a few friends for brunch on a weekend. They had quite a few dishes that were no available. Shang mee was recommended but it didn‚Äôt turn out great, it was overly salty. Cheese platter was pathetic, i wish they could be a little more generous with the accompaniments, it was just so pathetic. The saving grace was the fried pork trotters but the sauce that it came with was insufficient for the meal and chargeable. Just an overall stingy fell on the whole. Finally, to top it all off, the sangria and mimosa (2 hr buffet) felt like a rip off with watered down servings and they sure take an extremely time (15 mins) to serve each order."
Great food! Great service!,"Awesome food recommendation from Amando. Loves the cheese & sparkling wine.
Only thing the place is very hot, the Aircon is not strong."
Horrible service with ignorant and inattentive staff,"Upon confirmation of our booking, we were promised a box of delightful pralines. However, while we were checking-in, the counter staff mentioned that the pralines were out of stock and she gave us a coupon to redeem a complimentary dessert at Beast & Butterflies.

Hence, we decided to head down the Beast & Butterflies on the second day of stay to have our lunch. As excited as we were, we were looking to dive into a sumptuous meal. After being seated, we understood that there was a promotion of 1-for-1 main courses on a Tuesday, but we wanted to be sure of what was included in this promotion. Hence, we asked one of the service staff but he had no knowledge of the promotion and took quite a while to come back with an answer that it was not meant for lunch. After gaining clarity, we went through the menu and had decided on what we wanted.

To our demise, we had so much difficulty getting the attention of the service staff. After much of a hassle, we finally got hold of a young gentleman to assist us, but he shifted the responsibility to another colleague without informing us to wait a little while. Additionally, the colleague of his simply nodded his head but never came to our service for us to place our orders and instead went to serve other tables. We thought he may be busy and gave him another 5-10mins of wait, however, he never came.

After almost 15-20mins of wait with no one even following up with us on whether or not we are ready to order, we decided to leave because we felt that the service was terrible and probably no supervisor was there to oversee the operations and ensure customer satisfaction. Big disappointment."
One person spoils it all,"The moment we arrived at the restaurant we know the experience is going to be less than rosy. They were not able to find my reservation even if i show them my reservation confirmation or no. The first reaction of the service staff was not ""im sorry, let me check again"" but ""when did u place the reservation? Thats new cause i have never been asked when i placed the rservation. Throughout the night we r met again with this ""lady"" who drpped our food loudly on the table. There were a few friendly younger staff and the food was great. But the senior staff have to up their game cause i for one will not be a repeat customer."
Nice ambience with good food & service!,"Had smoked salmon tartare, kurobuta pork chop with blue cheese sauce, pork knuckles & ended the night with creme brulee. We love all 4 dishes & my bf enjoyed his surprise birthday dessert. Thanks to all the staff who helped made this happen! :)"
Amazing food & friendly service,"Service: Attentive Service with a smile

Atmosphere: Bustling, with a quiet hum of background murmurings and clink of cutleries

Food: We had the Tuesday 1 for 1 promotion. Now, I have a limited palate but I was pleasantly surprised to find the food much to my liking. We had the:
+Pumpkin & Mushroom Risotto: Not my favorite, but at least it wasn't a mushy mess like what I had at some other places.
+Spaghetti Vongole: As the 1st strand of aroma hit my nose, I was smitten. And when the first note of flavor (delicious stir-fried garlic) hit my tongue, I knew I was in deep. Possible the best spaghetti I have ever had, and I dislike seafood. Did I mention the great abundance of clams?
+Singapore Laksa: Quite flavorful and sweet, lots of tiny dried shrimps used as seasoning and the noodle type is ""pearl noodles/rat tails"" which is really smooth and goes well with the thick gravy.
+Kurobuta claypot rice: You get 2 shrimp chips and refreshingly crunchy, sweet and sour julienned pickles alongside the main dish which comes with an onsen egg. I'm not quite sure what the onsen egg is doing in there, quite an unfamiliar addition.
+Orh Nee Br√ªl√©e: I used to dislike yam, but this maybe the only one I can enjoy. It is a refreshing sweetness complimented by the caramelized sugar piece (Br√ªl√©e).
+Thin Crusted Apple Pie: I can actually taste the saltiness in the pie crust, which is a bit unusual. Not bad, but again, not my favorite.

Some food does take more time to prepare and you will have to wait quite a bit (i.e. the claypot rice)

Still, all in all, a great experience and I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy nice food."
Cocktail making session,It's a one good experience that I have never try before. The class is fun and the instructor is kind and patience.
Cocktail Making @ Beast & Butterflies,"Session was great and fun!! Each stage of cocktail Making was explained with demo in detail. After finish, will get to drink the cocktail and also a free shaker! Love it!"
Good Food but a bit slow service‚Ä¶,"The food is good and staff are friendly. Just that, the service is a bit slow‚Ä¶
I can on a weekday afternoon. It‚Äôs not packed but I still have to wait a duration for my wine and my main‚Ä¶ So don‚Äôt understand."
Cocktail workshop,Attended the cocktail workshop conducted by Vlad! We really enjoyed the session and would recommend to anyone who wants to spend a fun filled 1hr plus!
Cocktail making with Vlad,"Vlad was very welcoming, engaging and understood how our Singapore culture. He took time to know us and has very vast knowledge and experience on what he does. Through out what he taught us it will be unforgettable and something we can bring home with us to share our knowledge to friends and family. He is excellent and has very good people skills!"
