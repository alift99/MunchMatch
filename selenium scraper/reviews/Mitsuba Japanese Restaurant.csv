Very Good,Service was very good and polite. Food was good. Ambience was spacious and good too! We enjoyed our dinner. The sashimi cuts are very thick and generous for the buffet.
Buffet lunch,One of the best Japanese buffet. Sashimi is very fresh and other items are very delicious. Staffs are friendly and service is efficient. Will definitely come back again. Highly recommended.
Wonderful food reasonably priced,"Love the sashimi which is of generous cut. Love the cooked food as well, Good selection/choices Overall, value for money, you won’t be disappointed"
Sashimi Lover,"Great restaurant buffet for the whole family with range of sashimi, sushi, tempura and grilled stuff."
Great Dining Experience.,"Had the buffet dinner for 2 pax on 28-12 22. My nephew and I enjoyed ourselves very much. Some feedback on how some of the food could have been enhanced. Breaded Oyster needed some sauce to give it a bit more lift. Also the Grilled Gindara could nave been accompanied by a little teriyaki sauce.
Noticed the servings have shrunk a little. I suppose we could have ordered more of the same and we did.
I would like to be a loyal customer, will you consider offering a senior's discount?"
Good food with good view of Clarke Quay,My overseas guests enjoyed the wide and quality offerings on the Premium Buffet spread. The cheerful and pleasant service staff were very attentive and the food ordered did not take long to arrive at the table.
Not worth the price for premium buffet,"Paid $470plus for 4 pax. I find that food is so average , really not worth the price. Sashimi is cut too thick and not that fresh . Oyster has fishy smell. Too much cheese on crayfish. Unagi is so salty. The atmosphere and setting is cheap looking after their revamp. More like a Foodcourt , with cheap table/ chair quality."
Good food,"The food had a wide selection - Sashimi was fresh, and especially enjoyed the ikura maki. Would not recommend the chawanmushi as it had a really strong bonito taste. Service was very warm and friendly - they were proactive in clearing the plates, greeted and attended to us with a smile, and also nicely wished us a merry Christmas as we left. Unexpectedly, it wasn't too crowded for the Friday night before Christmas. Overall would come again."
Value for money,The lunch promo was very good value for money esp. on Christmas eve. Food was fresh and service was prompt. Lots of variety and sashimi cuts were thick. My friends and I left belly happy.
Mitsuba,"1. The quality of sashimi is good, though not very good and not many varieties
2. Overall, quite many varieties on the buffet menu, but only a few are nice, like tempura, grilled beef and some sushi, the rest are so-so.
3. The price is a bit expensive. If it can lower its price a bit, it should be very attractive to more patronizers"
premium buffet not worth,"brought my bosses and colleagues here. went for the premium, but food was of poor quality, no point going for premium buffet. out of all the premium buffet items, only the Hotate and prawns were good. wagyu was poor. if you really must come here for the sashimi buffet, just go for the normal one. Sashimi quality also wasn’t good, you have been warned."
One of the best Japanese buffet restaurant,Love their thick fresh sashimi slices. However that is not the only item on the menu that is delicious! HIGHLY recommended!
"Great food, great service",Really value for money if you are a seafood lover and go for the premium buffet. Food was fresh and delicious. Service was superb too - tables were cleared promptly and requests attended to swiftly as well. Pleasant dining experience. Will be back!
Nice Portion Size,Quiet ambience. Fresh food. Portion size just nice for 1 person. Attentive staff. Variety not as much for a buffet.
Worth the buffet price.,"Food arrived quite fast, and the pictures that you see on the menu is what you get. The sashimi was fairly thick cut and they didn't skimp on some of the more expensive items. Most restaurants would lower their standards over time if they get consistently big crowds, but this place is as good as it is 4 years ago."
"Good food, good time.",Went for bridal shower dinner. Ordered ala carte instead of buffet Cz my friends are small eaters. But we still had a great variety of delicious food served. And food was great. We had a good gathering. Time well spent.
Good experience we will go back,The sushi and sashimi quality were decent and portion was large. Waiting staff was polite and professional. We truly enjoyed our dining at Mitsuba. The buffet offers good value.
Dining @ Mitsuba Japanese Restaurant,"Was recommended by frenz to book for the Japanese Buffet. Restaurant is clean, good and spacious. Portion of the servings are good and reasonable. A small queries if the Chef can slice the sashimi at a slight thinner portion instead ? Cos the portion abit too thick and frenz commented like 烧肉 - feel qte ""jer Lak"" after having 2-3 plates (2pcs per plate). Other than that, the Staffs are friendly and helpful and explain well. Price wise are reasonable and will still recommend for Jap Buffet."
My favourite Japanese Restaurant,"Years ago it was started by one owner chef from the original and famous Wasabe Tei at Far East Plaza. Since new owner and management took over, it has maintained a very high level of service standard, and it has expanded its premises to serve more customers thus cutting waiting time. It has always been my favourite Japanese Restaurant."
"Nice restaurant, food was great","The slices of sashimi were thick. We had the buffet which made it worth. The other good was great too especially the beef, that was an unexpected surprise."
Buffet is Great!,"Fresh Sashimi and wide selection of buffet menu. Clean and spacious environment, staff was friendly and helpful. Service was fast too!"
Staff needs more training,"Reservation was with a ""Birthday"" in the comments, we brought a cake, and when we asked for the cake after our meal, the staff brought the cake out in the paper bag. We asked her to take it out, but she gave us a nasty look (as though we are very entitled), left the paper bag with the cake on the counter, and left to do something else. We ended up just taking the cake out ourselves. Not my first visit so I am surprised how bad the service is now. Food was average. View was good."
VERY NICE,"Salmon sashimi is really impressive, slices are thick and fresh. A must-go for salmon sahimi lovers!"
Don't order the premium,I visited a few times trying the regular buffet and it was not bad. And so I brought my customer over but this time round trying the premium buffet. Sadly the premium buffet is way below expectation as the food wasn't fresh. Tasted like ingredients been kept for quite some time. Doesn't taste premium at all. So i would advise people to try teh regular buffet instead.
Improvement of food quality,Fried and raw food are too salty. There are also limited dessert and drinks selection. The food quality does not reflect according to the buffet price.
Worth the trip!,Food is served fast and the servers are friendly and kept up with the fast pace. Their beef and grilled items are especially delicious!
Great service and fantastic food!,Good value for money. Staff are friendly and watchful to the needs of the customers. Food is fresh and yummy.
Great buffet!,Had birthday dinner here and food quality is really good. Fresh sashimi too! Price is also reasonable and service staffs are attentive
Shake head,"Poor service oriented crew. I could forgive if it’s robot at work. But it’s human. Lacked of empathy, worst, unwilling to listen sincerely & earnestly. nor assist the needs. I will not return again!"
Good food and fast service,Food was delicious and service was fast. Menu was easy to navigate on the note pad. Staff was very friendly and the food especially the sashimi was very fresh.
Birthday dinner for friend,"I made a reservation a week ahead and made a request to for table near their large windows overlooking Clarke Quay and they obliged. The waitress Rose was very warm, cheerful and witty. She even speaks Mandarin despite being a Filipina. Add on the fresh dishes and it was a great dining experience!"
Dinner at Mitsuba,"Food was amazing, gotta try the teapot soup. sashimi was served by thick cuts. Oysters were really great as well, fresh too!"
Thick sashimi slices,Value for money buffet as they serve up very thick sashimi slices. A wide variety of dishes to select from. Service was also quite prompt.
Birthday celebration for BFF,"Overall, the sashimi slices was thick and fresh for octopus and salmon. The rest was of normal standard. The food was serve hot upon ordering therefore the waiting time was a bit longer. The varieties were quite ok. The best they don’t have limited timing for the buffet. We spent 3 hours eating. The only cons was the aircon was v cold as it was just above us."
Buffet in Aug 2022,Went for the buffet after seeing highly reviewed and recommended reviews. A HUGE disappointment due to following: 1) Sushi quality is poor although thick slice. 2) Other cook food is OK. 3) Price was above average for this buffet. Will not re-visit
Enjoyable meal,My family & I had an enjoyable lunch. We love the sashimi and other dishes. I will definitely recommend to my family & friends.
Family nite dinner,My family & I always enjoyed our time at Mitsuba. Food is fresh & delicious. Friendly staff as well.
Got a good seating with nice view and very fast service,Got a good seating with nice view and very fast service. Came with 2 kids who are small eaters but considered adult price. But its was a for a birthday dinner still worth the experience
Visit Mitsuba on 23 July 2022,"Food quality in relation to the price point does not match. Did not enjoy as much compare to I went few months ago. The wasabi was disappointing. It does have much taste at all. Upon checking with the staff, staff agree that it was not that spicy/hotel and probably due to supplier. I actually booked an appointment in Aug and have since cancelled."
Value for Money Food,Quality of food is not as good as some reviews have mentioned. It is not comparable even to average Japanese restaurants. Servings were generous.
Excellent buffet,Amazing fresh and thick sashimi spread and timely service. Prices are reasonable for the normal buffet. Highly recommended!
Mitsuba buffet,The service was good and serving was pretty fast! Sashimi slices are good size cuts and not those tiny thin pieces you see from some restaurants. Overall food was good and worth the price. My family enjoyed it alot and we will revisit again!
The only proper Japanese buffet left in Singapore,"Our family used to be a patron of another Japanese buffet in Suntec, since its closure we struggled to find another Japanese restaurant in Singapore that served all you can eat snow crab legs.

We stumbled across Mistuba online and decided to give it a try. The environment is bright, clean and spacious. ( it looks like they have 3 units joint together!) There is a good variety of food on the premium menu, and to our pleasant surprise the highlight of the meal wasn't the Zuwai Kani that we came here for- their A5 Wagyu is a must to try, lightly grilled to perfection, it will melt in your mouth the moment you savour it.

The rest of the menu are more less similar to what you could get in a regular Japanese restaurant, food and service is good. We had a nice little meal here and will come back some day :)"
First Try,Not many variety. All the foods are very salty Sashimi not fresh Very small portion Very expensive Service so so only
Buffet dinner,Food serve is slower than usual. The quality of the food is not as good s before. E. G. Soft shell crab serve that day is extremely small in sizes.
Fresh sashimi is the standard,"Sashimi would set the standard for any Japanese restaurant, this one makes the cut for an excellent grade."
Good quality food at reasonable price,The grilled beef is a highlight. The sashimi and sushi are fresh. Service is good. Will definitely go back again.
Excellent Food,"The restaurant has expanded since I've last visited, and garners a good crowd even on a weekday night -- well-deserved! The food is delicious, well-cooked and served promptly. Do remember to book a table in advance, just in case to avoid disappointment."
Nice Japanese Buffet,"Reservation done via Chope app was fuss free. Food quality is good. Sashimi is thick but there's room of improvement for the cutting skill and presentation. Overall was ok just that 2 of us were arranged to be seated next to the counter with the non-stop ringing of their phone, which was quite irritating, asked if we could change seat, we were told it was fully book but I doubt it was."
Worth Spending,"Food is worth my spending. After ordering, food came quite fast. Dishes tastes good. No issue when reorder again."
Request for a table,"I couldn’t request for a better table. They told me I have to request. But however after awhile, they managed to changed it for us."
Excellent food & environment,"My family and I had a great time at Mitsuba. It is our favorite Japanese buffet. Great value for money, friendly service and excellent quality. You won’t know till you give it a try!"
Review for Mituba - bad experience,"My 4th visit to this Japanese restaurant, unlike from previous this time round mostly full house and shortage of service crew which lead to food serve came irregularly, some missing orders and deep fried food turned cold when served. ALL SERVICE STAFF ARE VERY RUDE AND INPATIENT LISTERNING!!!!!"
Good buffet meal,"It was Ladies' night and was celebrating Mother's day. The food is sooooo good. Love the sashimi, beef, prawns and chawanmushi. Lovely meal. The food came out fast too."
Overall very good dining experience at Mitsuba !,Reservations done through Chope was simple & fast! Dining experience at Mitsuba was excellent especially We love the spacious layout of the restaurant. Food was serve very fast & it was fresh! The waitress are polite & very prompt in serving! Overall good dining experience!m and will sure to visit again.
Nice wonderful experience,Sashimi is sliced thick and not thin. We enjoyed it very much. Grilled cod fish and fried octopus leg is very yummy. Service is very fast!! Portion of food is small per pax per bite so if you need more portion please order more. Overall wonderful experience! Would highly recommend!!
Some hiccups which can be rectified,"The swordfish sashimi wasn’t very fresh. The prawn tempura was powdery, the veg tempura was undercooked and shoyu was more on the sweet side.

It could have been because the place was fully packed. Service staff was quite busy.

It was a personal touch that the staff were taught to recognize guests from every table when it was time to foot the bill.

Overall, still a nice place I would return to."
Great! Will definitely return to this restaurant.,Overall food are decent. Staffs are friendly and attentive. Food served are piping hot! which I like it alot. There’s quite some crowd on a weekday dinner session and the environment is a bit noisy if you are expecting a rather calm dinner place.
Nice food,"Food was nice. However, as we are a big group of 12, we ordered via 2 tablets. Food was served without specifying which tablet it was ordered from. Hence, it got a little messy."
Fresh sashmi and lots of variety,"Most dishes are good except grilled giindara and tempura. The flour were too thick, especially ebi, the prawns taste don't taste too fresh"
"Good Food, Good Service",Food was served in small portion so you can tried most of the dishes. Food was served fast by robot. Waitress cleared plates and pour tea timely too.
"Cosy place, great food, excellent service.","Everything was great! Food was served promptly, quality is good and the taste suits my friends and me.
Plenty of variations to choose, quantity per servings is adequate as well.
The sake we ordered is easy to drink and the aroma lingers, indicating its freshness and fine quality.
Ordered extra oysters and the size exceeded our expectations, taste was creamy and definitely fresh and cleansed off excess seawater.

The only thing is the place is the centralized Air-Con seems to be full blast, gets very chilly.

Otherwise, it is a highly recommended place to have a good meal!"
mitsuba,good service and food. Would have been better if they took the trouble to seat 7 of us near to each other. ( we were 4 + 3 and the booking was made during the period when max was 5 per table ). Also the beef dish was slow in coming and replenishing.
Food are nice.,"The sashimi portal are thick and fresh. Food are nice, tasty and portion just nice. Will go and visit again."
Good food,good food good service except for one of their pinoy staff quiet rude keep slamming the food on table. and a lot of other customers very noisy i was just trying to enjoy a nice dinner
Sashimi not fresh. feel like vomiting. cod fish not as crispy as my 1st visit. Don't go on Monday. cheaper quality.,It's disappointing visit. If u want to eat better quality...go on Friday. I don't know why Monday so bad.
Value for money and the foods are fresh.,"Reservation for table is convenient and accurate. Value for money with 4 pax 1 dine free promotion, and the foods are fresh. Service are decent and responsive. Hygiene condition is satisfactory and ambience is good. I'm a repeat patronage with strong recommendation."
What a disappointment!,The standard of the sashimi was a far cry from a year ago before the restaurant was renovated. The delicious wagyu beef that was available for a one time order previously was not in the menu anymore. $51++ ala carte buffet was definitely not worth the price.
MITZUBA EXPERIENCE,"IT EXPANDED TO MUCH BIGGER NOW AND USE ROBOT TO DELIVER THE food to the waitress to deliver to guests. Cleaner and nice environment, service improved. Sashimi quality is above average, not the best though. Price increased as well"
Is better nw,"The previous time when i was there maybe 1-2 years ago. I was disappointed with the food but this time I am delighted, sashimi was good, thick and fresh. Chawamushi and broth of the noodles/udon can be improve, otherwise all are good."
Really good experience,"Food was really tasty, although most of them could have arrived hot instead of lukewarm/cold. The sashimi was really thick and nice."
BUFFET LUNCH,Food quality not bad if base on the price .worth but shashimi average .depend on your expectation but of course you may find some fresh some not but the portion and handroll good .Overall still a pleasant meal .alot people and quite crowd during wkdays lunch hours
Value for money,"A-la-Carte buffet at an affordable price. Food quality is good. Good and prompt service. Had visited this restaurant multiple times, always enjoy it. Seating is much spacious after renovation."
Good service and fresh food,Service was quite prompt and the food was served quickly to your table upon ordering thru the notepad. Food is also very fresh.
Awesome food!,My 2nd visit. Fast and attentive service. Love the food here especially the sashimi which is very fresh. Spoiled for choice as menu offers a wide variety. The complimentary starter sets the tone for what’s to come. Only thing the chairs don’t have high back rests so could be uncomfortable for some.
Not worth the $$,"Frequent diner at the Mitsuba restaurant but not anymore after yesterday episode. Food were substandard, staff were inattentive to the extend I don’t think it is rude to label them rude. The few times I asked for our green tea to be refilled, they either pretend they didn’t see or their body languages blatantly suggest we should just eat and go. Come here if you want attitude and look for Li Yan, Rose & Som."
Good food at a great price,"Good food at a great price.
Japanese Restaurants do not usually offer ikura at this price point.
But Mitsuba does. Bonus : They have ice cream as well.
Just one thing though, the thick salmon sashimi, would prefer the option to choose between thick or thin slices as the thickness affects the taste."
"Good Japanese Food, Nice Restaurant",Great ambiance and friendly staff. Menu with great selection. Fresh and great tasting dishes. Overall great experience. Keep it up!
Spacious,"Food's quality is good. Mainly went for Sashimi - Swordfish (Mekajiki), Yellowtail (Hamachi), Shiro Maguro (White Tuna), Maguro (Tuna), and Salmon. They have Octopus (Tako) Sashimi on the menu also."
Valentine day Japanese lunch Buffet,Everything was very good. Sashimi was very thick cut and unagi was nice. Overall is good and will go again.
Experience in Mitsuba,"This is the first time we tried here with my four sisters, atmosphere here is clean, bright but not so cosy. Food is very good and we enjoyed the freshness of the food and service is good and fast. As we are all senior, hope might have special rates as we cannot eat a lot but enjoy food. We will come back again"
Fast and quality food,"Went on Monday (ladies night), and did the buffet. The discount basically covers gst & service charge. Sashimi was good!! Cod fish was damn good too. Service was pretty fast. Don’t bother ordering fries and sausage, not worth the stomach space."
Mitsuba good experience,"Went for buffet lunch with family of 5 and paid for 4. Overall : Nice environment, delicious food and good service!"
Fast table service,First time dining at Mitsuba and I have to say that I am impressed with their table service. Will dine again next time!
Awesome buffet with fresh ingredients,It’s my first time dining at Mitsuba. Their ingredients are fresh and good. I enjoyed the buffet spread. Will come back again in future.
Birthday buffet dinner.,"Varieties were average.
Not much sushi choices, they don’t have like popular sushi like inari.
After 1-2 rounds of ordering, doesn’t know what to order.
Other buffet places, usually can’t order finish, but this is order till don’t know what to order again the same food instead.
Only the beef is impressive."
Good,Environment good and nice. Service very nicely. Friendly Food delicious. Food come out very fast and fresh.
High Quality Food,"It was our first time to visit Mitsuba. We were enticed by the delectable food photos on their website and indeed we were not disappointed. Our expectations were exceeded even.

The food were freshly made, flavourful, and obviously used high quality ingredients.

We had the buffet and if we ordered food items not in the buffet menu, the staff checks to confirm that we had to pay top-up for the items. This is very good as it is made very clear to the customer, no surprise at check out time!

The service was very good, too. The servers were prompt to refill our drinks and clear our table with empty dishes. We really felt like we were valued guests."
2nd visit and will be back,Restaurant expanded and very spacious. Went on 1 Jan with my family and were seated near the reception counted. What annoyed us was the phone kept ringing non stop and nobody picks up the phone. Spoke to the waitress and she just smiled and walked away. Frustrating!
Review of MISUBA JAP RESTAURANT,"When having the buffet, found a wire piece( for washing plate) on the chicken wing. Inform the staff , the staff never explain on this matter, just ask whether need a new plate on the chicken wing.
They Don’t seem to feel surprised or apologetic at all.
Service altitude is bad. ( just served and put the plate on side of table)"
Best Restaurant/Food,"Great place to go for gathering. Food are great except for the Ebi tempura and Agedashi Tofu doesn't seem fresh. Overall, food, service and great atmosphere. Will definitely go again. Thanks for the great service."
Amazing service,"Service was great, staffs was friendly and nice. Food came pretty fast despite the restaurant was full. But overall is not amazing I feel? Something was lacking."
GREAT!,I had visited this place since before covid. The friendly staff and good food are the main reason i keep going back whenever dine in are allowed. The sashimi are so fresh and food are well portion. Had an enjoyable night.
Probably last time there,Booked the restaurant as I saw the good reviews. Food service is pretty slow. Variety is not impressive.
visit with friends,"Went on a Monday morning, it was very crowded but was puzzled. Before I made my appointment, I asked for a booth seat but was not given.. reason being that it was only for pax of 5. Then what's the purpose of appointment? lol. Later I see 2-3 pax on the booth which is pretty unfair, so maybe i shouldnt book but walk in at peak hour so that I can pray and get the booth seat. Wasn't very happy with the service as well, when requested for green tea/ others, service provider just turn and walk away, without acknowledging although they do come back with our request later. It was also very crowded and noisy at my area with different group of customers sitting just next to one another"
Eat Till You Drop.,Friendly Staff Good Services Clean Environment Freshest Sashimi Best beef and duck meat Surely not my last visit Keep Up The Good Work.
Brilliant experience,"Was with my hubby and brother for the dinner. Other than not able to accommodate us to the window seat, the whole experience was awesome, staff are very attentive,food was marvelous and great variety too! Definitely be back !"
Food is good,Went mitsuba twice this year. Very good! Swordfish tasted better at 6pm after 3 servings only salmon tasted the best no idea why. Love the chawanmushi and also the cod fish. Spam Tofu with century egg here don’t order from chinese restorans ever. Not sure whether is it me but seems more expensive now on Monday night ? 117.7 for 1 lady 1 guy on ladies night
Services,"Service not good, cant compromise for guest request just for a container to put a piece. Staff mentioned as the cake is not from the restaurant"
Yummy food and venue is spacious,"The place overall is spacious. Service staff is attentive but gets busier when peak, food serving slows down and food is not hot when served. Hope this can improve and can visit again."
