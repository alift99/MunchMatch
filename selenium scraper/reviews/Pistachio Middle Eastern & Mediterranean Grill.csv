Love this restaurant food is amazing!!!,"discovered this Restaurant while we were strolling around Wheelock, so if you happen to be on the area, its a good place to try out in the middle of all the shopping spree and malls. the Service is amazing and food is really good, we got the tomahawk steak, perfectly seared and Chef himself did it on our table. it was Divine experience shared with friends. we also got the skewers with rice, Hummus and pita and the shrimp

it was an amazing experience can't wait for to the try the next good stuff on the menu :)"
Memorable dining experience,"Our first visit to the restaurant and we were definitely impressed with the food and service. Food was very tasty and fresh, we could taste that the ingredients were of premium quality. We ordered several dips and freshly made pita, lamb chops mousaka, Iskendar kebab, and Mix Grill. The fluffy pita was served piping hot and went so well with the dips. All the meats were well grilled and flavourful. We enjoyed every single item.

Restaurant was packed with diners and had a happy vibe. It had a homey ambience. We highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys quality unpretentious food.

Thank you Pistachio team for the memorable dining experience."
Love Arabic Food,"BEST arabic restaurant in Singapore.. attentive service. Price is very affordable for the quality that they serve. We had a memorable experience dining at pistachio, not just because of the food is excellent, I especially love the beef ribs, pita bread , and flafel"
"No taste, Great presentation","There are many choices from Mediterranean but just as a name. Taste has nothing to do with the originals.
We have tried 3 different dishes, without satisfaction.
Just a tourist trap.
Price/quality ratio is strongly disturbed.
It is clean, neat. Presentation of the food is in place."
Best Middle Eastern restaurant for a memorable meal,"This is our return visit to the restaurant within a month, and we were not disappointed. We ordered Adana kebab, lamb shank and Moroccan Couscous Royale. Every dish was exceptional and lived up to our expectations. Despite a full house on a weekday evening, we did not have to wait long for food to be served. The service staff were very efficient and professional. Thank you Pistachio team for another memorable evening. We will definitely be back soon."
Disappointed,"On my first visit when they were at Balestier, the Pistachio mixed grill was wonderful - all the meats were succulent, delicious and well spiced. This time, the lamb chops were overcooked and tasteless, so was the beef. Only the chicken and dipping sauce were good. Told the staff about it but they only nodded. Truly disappointed."
A must to go,As always over the top best Mediterranean food not just in Singapore but to me anywhere I’m the world. Fast efficient service reasonable prices and great atmosphere for Mediterranean restaurant and the chef is such a caring nice man. I highly highly recommend you try it.
Snapper and lamb shank were great,The Egyptian Snapper and Tunisien lamb shank were highlights. They even created a custom Massouka dish. Staff was very helpful and service was prompt. Worth a repeat visit!
Come here for good food,"Good food, good service, good ambiance. Straightforward Middle Eastern food without attempts at going Asian fusion. No MSG, no happy feet, and no heart palpitations. Just good ingredients and well cooked. The owner knows what he's doing. My only gripe was the high price of some items but you're in Singapore after all."
"Food with ""flare""","We had lunch in Pistachio, and tried their mixed grill (comes with 2 lamb chops and 2 shish kebab skewers. Not a large serving for those used to the US or Middle Eastern servings; order a second main dish if there are 2 or more people with a healthy appetite at the table!), pistachio salad (similar to fattush salad, served with fried rather than toasted pita strips on it), cheese boregi (think tasting menu portion, quite tasty though) and kibbeh (fried version, nice balance of meat, spices, nuts). Service was excellent (a shout out to Hong and Aisha, our attentive servers), food is tasty, and if you order the halloumi starter, it comes with a ""flare"" -- the chef runs out of the kitchen to first set the cheese on fire and then douse the flames much to the delight of the Instagram crowd and the amusement of the rest! Will come back and would recommend it."
South Mediterranean Cuisine,"Popular restaurant even at early opening times. Should book ahead to get a seating. Order electronically through your hp. Prefer a menu because too small to see from the hp. For young people perhaps it makes no difference. However was able to order their hummus and baba ghannoush dip with a long pita bread. Nice smooth tasting! The chicken tagine cooked with olives is good. The Tunisian lamb shank and beef Adana was good tasting with their saffron rice and pita bread. Dessert we had their flourless almond and coconut with ice cream. Tasted awesome. Service was good and friendly while price is mid to high. Other dishes looks good, flaming cheese and mix grill."
Not for anyone with dietary restrictions,"Despite identifying numerous food items that can be made suitable for the keto diet, they WERE NOT WILLING to budge an inch to welcome diners with dietary restrictions. First time ever that I heard this from any restaurant worldwide. Definitely the joke of the town."
Passable quality,"Greek/Mediterranean fare. We didn't have many dishes but was somehow still stuffed. Can never resist hummus, and hot pita bread, they are perfect together, always. And the pita here is huge, long and pretty good.

We ordered 2 other Chef Recommendations - Mussels in Garlic Cream sauce and Beef Tenderloin.

If these were the best the chef can do, then hmm, can't imagine the rest. Not that these tasted awful but just wasn't wow and certainly not value-for-money, especially the beef, rather pricey for the thin slices, flavourful though. They were surprisingly crowded for a Monday night so reservations recommended."
My favorite restaurant in Singapore,Food is actually better than precovid when we were here nov 2019 always eat there atleast once per trip. Food is totally amazing something for everyone. Great staff as well
My favorite restaurant in Singapore,"So happy to be back dining in my favorite restaurant in Singapore. Food quality is consistently good, so is the service. Chef Khaled and his team use fresh ingredients and prepares food fresh upon order, you can definitely taste the difference. The restaurant is always packed, testimony to the excellent food and dining experience. Reservation is highly recommended especially for weekends."
Unfortunate experience,"Food was considered tasty until entire table came down with upset stomach later. Informed restaurant via email but they took their time to respond. Was not a nice response from the restaurant manager. Basically said they weren't at fault and we could not prove it was their food bcos medical tests were not performed on the same day. Also implied we did not know how to appreciate their kind of food. We are a group of well travelled friends and it was not the first time we have had mediteraaean food. However, not wanting to get into a tit for tat situation, i just asked for full refund and ended the correspondence with the restaurant. Something was not right for our table that day, that's all i can say."
Best food,"Best food in Singapore the food was excellent and the hummuss ,soup was excellent thanks to the stuff ...........................,......,........................................................"
"Good service, fantastic food","My family came for a birthday celebration, and we loved the food! The beef rib with briyani and mixed grill are must-tries. Not to forget the lovely table service - Aisha our server was very approachable and detailed in recommending dishes. Will come back again!"
Good and tasty,"Second time here and another scrumptious meal. The service Is good too. It is a tad pricy so do be warned, but the flavours make it worthwhile."
Good Middle Eastern Food but it can pinch you a little!!,Good tasty food! Nothing to crow abt the ambience of the place! It can be further improved!! Main set Portions can be better too! Service can be improved also! Eg when the plates are dirty the service staff can make an effort on their own to change it! Generally the staffs were friendly! Nevertheless We had a good dinner! Pls make sure you make yr reservation before heading there! Seats are always full! So they don’t entertain walk-in’s!
Underwhelmed,"I love middle eastern and Mediterranean food, so I was quite keen to this place out. I visited with my wife on an early Saturday evening. I would say that the food is good without a doubt. However the service is pretty poor, considering you need to do all the ordering (plus paying up front!) on an app. At no point did anyone ask us if the food etc was okay. We finished our meal and simply left with no real 'thanks or goodbye' from any of the front of house staff. Prices are high end and with the same sort of service you'd expect at a fast food joint."
Nice middle eastern food in Orchard road,"Portions are rather large. Great for sharing. Beef kebab with rice, mussels in cream sauce, moussaka. It came with a portion of salad. Service was prompt."
"Chef Khaled - symbol of talent, experience and passion!","Amazing authentic Mediterranean food… I can share a long list of the exceptionally crafted dishes - simply whatever you pick, you get the desired taste! However, more than the food is the high sense of hospitality of Chef Khaled - IMPRESSIVE… was having a friendly chat with him about some food My family misses in Singapore. Shortly after, was surprised seeing him with what I was craving for… spontaneous marvelous creation that says a lot about the talent, passion and above all - the human touch that is made with true love…… THANK YOU Chef Khaled and keep inspiring us!!"
Average,"Hummus was very average. Pitta bread is nice and good size. Lamb shank was very good. Iskender Kebab was awful - very bland and hardly any sauce or yoghurt. Please ask
Service was great. Overall 3*, would not visit again because food is average and prices are very high-end."
Best quality food cooked with passion!,"This is one restaurant where the food is cooked with sincerity and passion, definitely a rare gem in Singapore. I ordered the Lamb Chops with Moussaka and the Sultan's Delight as my family loves lamb dishes, and both were AWESOME! We could taste the freshness and authentic flavours in every mouthful. Food was packed with care for delivery and they were still warm upon arrival as we live nearby. It's definitely worth paying for such premium quality. We have dined in the restaurant before the lockdown, the food quality is consistent. The passion and sincerity of the food is a reflection of Chef Khaled who is a truly humble man. I highly recommend Pistachio, you get the quality that you pay for."
Was the worst middle eastern food experience i hv ever had.,"We came for dinner earlier tonight and the food was absolutely disappointing.

The most disappointing was the couscous. For someone who has had couscous in the middle east, the couscous was a shame. It was tasteless and the broth that was given on the side tasted like couscous cooking water, it was tasteless.
There was no flavour whatsoever, we had added on harissa, and it was the most confusing harissa i hv ever had.

It tasted like i was eating at ananda bhavan. The harissa was not a middle eastern harissa at all but tasted like a south indian pickled mango achar.
It was a very sad experience.

The borek tasted like spinach filled popiahs. The only thing edible was the beef adana and the kibbeh. But that too was not fantastic, it was dry but ate it nonetheless as we were starving.

Please improve in your food quality, I wonder how you can pass off as a middle eastern Restaurant. It was like an indian fusion Restaurant that ran out of spices."
"Amazing food, great experience and an awesome chef","One of the best middle eastern cuisines we've tried.

Their hummus was very smooth, delicious and authentic. The taste wasn't overpowering and went really well with the pita bread.

If you love pizza, you must try the Turkish Pide. The beef is oozing with flavour, it was just so good.

Moroccan Couscous Royale was our favourite dish of the night. The lamb was amazingly tender and not gamey. The meat was of a premium cut, very worth the price.

Chef Khaled came out to greet us and made us feel welcomed. Very friendly and humble.

We came here after reading reviews and it didn't disappoint. Great experience, hope to come back again!"
Lovely place for Middle Eastern cuisine and more,One of the best restaurants in Wheelock and my fave in town for Middle Eastern cuisine. Chef was so hospitable too!
Reservation is necessary as restaurant is popular,"i used to enjoy dining at their cosy outlet in Zhongshan Mall when it was considered as a hidden gem. However this Orchard outlet is bigger and probably more expensive. It is still as popular and I realised that reservation is necessary. We went at 11.30 am without reservation and fortunately were offered a table till 12.30 pm. We had the vegetarian pide, falafel and hummus. The falafel comes with a small bowl of hummus too. Enjoyable meal."
The Pyramid in Singapore,"Best Middle Eastern cuisine in Singapore. Very proud to have the Egyptian delicacies in the heart of Orchard Rd.

The Outlet is well decorated with a nice Egyptian Heliography mural wall. The food quality is simply amazing. We had the Iskandarani Kebabs, Cheese Pita breads, Pistachio salad, Hummus and Tomato Soup. We enjoyed every bit of it and truly enjoyed the ambiance. There was a very omnipotent Vibe in the air which made the place so lively.

Well done to Chef Khaled, Madam Agnes and the A-Team!"
"Yummy, Healthy, Delightful Communal Mediterranean Food in a Warm Atmosphere","Saying Pistachio Grill is one my most favourite restaurants (even maybe the most) in the whole world is not an exaggeration. My wife and I always enjoy being welcomed by the hospitality of Chef Khaled and in such a warm atmosphere we can always enjoy their variety of Mediterranean cuisines, which are both uniquely yummy and healthy (created by healthy natural ingredients with utmost care).

Truly a warmth to our stomachs and hearts (try one of their desserts, Um Ali, and you'll understand what I mean)."
Scrumptious food and wonderful hospitality!,"We decided to visit the restaurant for lunch while at Orchard and were delighted with the selection. A wide variety of scrumptious mid eastern cuisine well made and served with a smile! What more can one ask for! No frowns or rushed staff - everyone was very friendly and promised to find us seats even without a reservation. Khalid is an excellent cook and a lovely owner and stopped by to chat when he learnt I am gluten free. He dished up a yummy dessert! To be fair, do let him know in advance when you plan to visit so he has some time to organise the special ingredients! Lots of space and a nice buzz to the place! Do stop by for a meal if you are in the area. I am certainly eating here with my family next time. A double thumbs up!!!"
"Came as a customer, but gifted with friendship, Awesome Chef Khaled","I'm literally full of gratitude. Brought my beloved mother and sister there for an impromptu lunch as I was stressed with work and missed them. Chef Khaled totally did not disappoint. The food is authentic and freshly made, but what I love was the conversation we had with the Chef. He has immense passion with his craft and hospitality. We are left happy and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere. Will definitely come back for more memorable occasions. We tried the falafel, Moroccan couscous,Kunefeh, Bedouin Delight, Moroccan mint tea, Arabic Briyani Rice, Baba Ganoush, Hummus Kawerma, Lebanese Zater Bread and Garlic Cheese Peta bread. Would love to try the Chef's Specials in the next visit."
"Great tasting food, ambience and service.","Enjoyed my time! The food was very satisfying, the ambience was of high quality and very relaxing. The service was also very quick, staff were very attentive and even the owner attended to us! Chef Khaled, the owner and chef of the restaurant, was very friendly, humble and even approached us to ensure our order’s been well taken care of. I ordered for my mum and the Prawn Singray and added on briyani as a side and the chef also kindly arranged to serve a complimentary mini cake made out of dates (I had earlier requested for this when I made the reservation). I highly recommend this restaurant! Looking forward to coming back!"
FAB 4,"An awesome dining experience at Pistachios. Excellent service. Food served on time and quality food. No msg and preservatives used.

The desserts OMG was so yummylicious and the sweetness is just right especially for those who are on a diet!

The chef is very friendly!

For Mediterranean food lovers its a must try!

Thank you chef for a wonderful experience!"
"Good food, good service.","Good food, good service, good experience. I’m a big fan of Mediterranean and middle eastern cuisine , and this restaurant serves some fantastic food. The beef rib with bryani rice, the mussels ... fantastic ."
Very nice Mediterranean Restaurant in Singapore,Khaled and his team do an excellent job! Authentic Egyptian/Lebanese/Mediterranean food backed by really efficient service. Wide-ranging menu to choose from. Generous portions and always a pleasure to eat there.
Outstanding in every way!!,"We lived in the Middle East for a long time and were craving for the hot bread, the hummus and the fattoush. We were not disappointed in the least. Great food, amazing presentation and the personal attention of the chef made this a lunch to remember. Absolutely don't miss the baklava as it deserves an award!"
Moroccan Cuisine,"They are trying to go everything orderong on line including payments. Guess it will take some time. Some photos are missing and was difficult to imagine the food presentation.
However, is a good effort.
Food was good and the lamb sausages was good.
Overall food presentation and service is good."
Best Turkish Food!,"The best Turkish food I had so far in my life! I ordered the lunch menu Turkish Platter that cost only $19. Love the tender and moist beef kebab, the sauce for the salad, the freshly made saffron rice and the tomato dip. Love it all!"
Full support for Pistachio!,"Before circuit breaker, i have dined at the restaurant and all times food was fantastic! This time i opted for pick up and food was very good just as i remembered it to be! I love ordering a side of lamb sausages because they are so delicious!!! They were also kind enough to include a dessert. Thank you Chef Khaled and team, i hope dine in at your restaurant soon!"
Let’s support Chef Khaled!,"We’re big fans of chef Khaled and wanted to support him during circuit breaker. With the normal decrease in quality between dine-in and takeaway, we should have ordered more dishes with sauce, as the kebab and pide dishes are too dry. Prices are high, as there is no discount (as in many other restaurants), but let’s not complaint. We want him to go through this and prosper again after the loosening up."
Surprise Birthday Dinner,"Had a surprise birthday dinner during the circuit breaker. It amazingly stunning food keep thinking abt it. Lamb, couscous,pide ofcause the cake! 🎂 if I could rate more than 5 I would bravo 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼#walahi #mediterraneanfix Will definitely visit the restaurant after the CB."
Quality food from a restaurant run by a super passionate chef!,"This review comes a few months late but I promised Chef Khaled I'd do it so here it is (we are not associated with the restaurant in any way, the head chef was just really friendly):

We ordered the mix grill set (a sharing item for 2-3). It had a skewer of chicken, lamb, and perhaps beef? Under it was a bed of rice. The whole thing was phenomenal. The rice was the most fragrant, well seasoned rice we've ever had from a Mediterranean meal. The meats were soft, succulent, and delicious. The chicken was very unique in that it was coated with a bit of cheese, giving it a beautiful rich flavour

That would have been the end of the meal for us as it was very filling for 2 (myself and my girlfriend). As an aspiring home chef, I wanted to have a look at the kitchen and the staff were very friendly about it (excellent service by the way). That's where we met Chef Khaled, and because he was such a kind guy and I was so curious, he invited us to try some of the lavash (bread). He gave us babaganoush and hummus as dips. We sat down with him and had an hour long conversation. He shared about his life, his culinary journey, and his cooking philosophy. In short, I have mad respect for him and his philosophy. For example, Khaled is very well versed in Ayurvedic food as medicine, and seeks to incorporate it in his food.

I obviously can't guarantee everyone a similar experience, but I can say the food and service are excellent and would certainly recommend this restaurant.

What could be better? I didn't try enough other food to know, but my girlfriend told me that from her previous visit, the saganaki was not worth the price. I can't verify that, and have no negative comments based on my experience."
Delicious food,"The food was exquisite, the portions were good, we could finish everything. The lamb chops are delicioussssss, the mousaka excellent 😍😍😍 and prices are super low!"
Best Middle-Eastern food in Singapore,"Excellent quality, superbly cooked, and they manage to squeeze a bit of nice touch even in a plain delivery (we got an extra dessert with a handwritten note).

After all, it's possible to have a bit of nice life during the coronavirus. Thank you, Khaled and the team.

We hope we'll get to visit you in person."
A delightful and delectable culinary journey!,"From the moment we walked into the aisle facing this restaurant , to the point of entering it, there was a feeling of warmth and coziness exuding from the interiors of the understated decor. Walking into Pistachio restaurant gave me this welcoming feeling of coming back home to a familiar yet relaxing atmosphere where good food and great conversations makes for a heady and magical mix. It truly reflects the owners' warm, down to earth, generous, and friendly personalities.

From the attentive staff to the easy to read, well designed menu, there is a palpable sense that the loving attention given to details will extend to the superlative food itself. And we were delighted by the pita bread served. Served at just the right degree of softness and crispness, it is always one of my comfort food of sorts. Dipped in hummus for a delicious appetizer of what is to come.

Pistachio mixed grill is a combo of skewered lamb, chicken and beef that comes together with saffron rice and salad. The meat is all-so -tender and soft, and seasoned to near perfection with its blend of spices and ingredients. Why i say near perfection is only because I haven't even begun truly appreciating the unique and almost transcendent experience of the dishes before they have become a memory, but one which I know I can return to again and again.

Bring your friends, family, and loved ones to this little gem. The food is truly authentic and from the time you enter to the moment you leave, it's like taking a ride on Aladdin's magic carpet. You enter a whole new world! Whether you are coming here to escape the pressures of the outside world or to have a treat with family and friends, you will be enriched by this wonderful culinary experience."
They have never let me down,They have never let me down yet. Ate there so many times but only twice at the new location which is 100 times better than the last one. If a local or tourist you must try this restaurant and the chef puts his heart and dole into everything to do with the restaurant
Superb Food Mediterranean style,Had some great Turkish fare ... great food and nice cosy restaurant. The hummus sauce for the pide were so yummy - we needed more! Great atmosphere and great with family and friends!
"Good food, good service","It's my third time visiting Pistachio Grill, and each time I go there, the place impresses me.

We ordered a Zater bread with hummus for starters which we loved. Followed by the Pistachio mixed grill which was excellent as ever. Chef Khaled, as usual, came out and even helped us with the grill and taught us the best way to eat it.

On top of the excellent food, Chef Khaled was very friendly and chatted with us, emphasising that good food need not be unhealthy, and even served us dessert on the house to commemorate our date and birthday celebration.

The food, conversation, and the dessert really made our day and it was a pleasure to be able to dine at Pistachio Grill as always."
Authentic Middle Eastern Cuisine,"Friendly staff and efficient service.
I had a starter of baba ghanoush which I ate with my shish taouk. The food was delicious and, more importantly for me, authentic in taste. The baba ghanoush, with its garnish of pomegranate seeds, transported me back to the years I lived in the Middle East. I was delighted to eat something that evoked such strong memories."
Best Mediterranean food in Singapore,"My family and I have have ate our fare share of Mediterranean food but none of them has come close to the standard that this restaurant has provided.

The food was just a standard above the rest compared to what we have eaten elsewhere and it shows with the passion for cooking that chef Khaled has emanated from his presence.

Every dish was made with love and care for the customer's well-being in terms of using healthier ingredients as well as their taste buds.

Honestly what can be recommended from the restaurant is everything on the menu. Every dish was just delicious and well-prepared, nothing was overcooked,nothing was undercooked, and all the flavors blended amazingly well.

I highly recommend a trip down to this restaurant if you have a special occasion,a family dinner or for just a nice date night.

10 out of 10 will visit again.

10 out of 10 would recommend to everyone that I know."
Authentic Middle Eastern,Its one of the best Middle Eastern restaurants in Singapore The chef and owner is very friendly and makes really really good sharing dishes for big families Try the lamb leg!
Great Food and Friendly Chef,We went to Pistachio for dinner. Food and the service were impeccable. The taouleh was a refreshing salad. The burning fried cheese and the tomahawk didn't disappoint with our steak just being at the right doneness. Chef Khaled was really hospitable and he mingled with the guests to ensure that the food and service were up to the mark. Wonderful restaurant...will definitely come back again
"Great Middle Eastern, from an Arab","We went to Pistachio over the holidays and had a lot of great food. As an Egyptian, I hold a fairly high standard for Middle Eastern food and so was skeptical when I heard of the place. Chef Khaled and team delivered, regardless of if the dish was Egyptian or Saudi.

The team did a great job on all the dishes, from the Kebab to the Um Ali and Kanafeh and everything in between (and as a party of 11, we tried a lot of them). I highlight the tomahawk steak, which they finish in front of you, and is both delicious and tender.

From an ambience perspective, it’s a great place to go too - very nice design and set-up."
Excellent Middle eastern restaurant,"We were Athens in Nov 19 and some of the dishes here reminded us of Athens and peaked our interest.

We ordered Meat Platter for 2 as the main course and Konafeh (one of my favourite desserts)

Meat platter was delicious... I especially like the lamb chops.... the chicken was well charred and flavourful... the beef was tasty but the texture was like a meat patty. The saffron rice was delicious too as it goes well with the meat

The Konafeh was good but too expensive imo.

I still prefer the Kunefe I ate many years ago at Suntec City top floor before all the renovation (the restaurant is no longer open anywhere if not wrong). Their kunefe had a milky sauce/cream poured over it

Overall I will definitely visit this place again to try their other dishes. Prices are reasonable but I did notice their dishes involving cheese are on the pricier side like konafeh, some flaming cheese dish and “popiah” with cheese filling."
"Excellent food, excellent staff excellent service and an excellent Chef Khalid","The restaurant is up the escalators on the left above Marks and Spencers at the Wheelock Place entrance. We visited twice during our visit to Singapore in December.
The service is excellent and the food just out of this world and cooked to perfection.
They have on the menu a Tomahawk Beef Steak (1.6Kg) its massive and I saw it brought out for a party and cut in slices it was cooked to perfection but its not for the faint hearted.
Excellent throughout and if in Singapore pay it a vist but woulod advise booking first."
Brilliant place for a special occasion!,The food was incredible. The bread was soft and meat succulent. The best kenafe ever! Well worth it if you’re in Singapore
Great food and great Chef!,"Loved everything thing we had. Cooked as a perfect delicacy, with flavours oozing from each dish. Specially try the pistachio dessert cake! You get to speak directly to the Chef, so hear his tales on the uniqueness of his preparation (natural and herbal elements) or his stories of the culmination of his Chef experience and recipes."
A royal experience,"Great dinner experience! We had the pita, tabouleh, hummus and mix grill - every dish was perfection! The food was great, atmosphere was homely and we even got to chat with the chef Khaled who shared on the preparation process. A lot of thought goes into each dish that makes that great. Chef Khaled also shared about the special chili that takes a whopping six months to prepare! Understand he used to serve the royal families in his time at Four Seasons, Maldives. Really a pleasant experience I’d recommend to all. Nothing less than five stars!"
Excellent food with superb service,"Appetizer, bread and salad, is very fresh as they prepared upon order. The steak was perfectly grilled to desired and very juicy when bite into. Lastly, tea and dessert at the end is a must to complete the meal.
Price is reasonable for the quality, food and service.
Thank you for the great experience Khalid. Will visit again as promised."
Excellent Food & Lovely Service,"A must visit if you’re looking for yummilicious middle eastern meal! This is our regular go to place now for a celebration with family or friends. Menu selection is complete and food is of great quality. Price is also reasonable and affordable. Must try!!! Thank you Khaled, wife and team for making our visits always such a memorable meal!"
"Mediocre service, tasteless meat, not worth it","We went for dinner on a weekday night. The tables all had reservations but less than half were full when we were seated.

Ordered the pita bread which was absolutely lovely, warm, fresh and tasty and the dips, one eggplant and one hummus were a great pairing.

The disappointment really came with our other dishes, our $18 meat pie appetizer (not pictured) was a giant let down, the meat was very bland and the dish was totally underwhelming and not worth it at all.

Our main of beef kebab which followed unfortunately was not much different. The meat although it had a good char and was somewhat juicy, was just lacking flavor. Where are the spices and the seasoning and salt? I've had $5 kebabs which taste so much better, it was such a shame.

All the chefs need to do is to cook a tasting portion of the kebab meat before service to make sure the seasoning is sufficient.

Service was okay, we had to wave over to the staff however every single time I needed a water refill.

Overall based on how tasteless the meat was, I really can't bring myself to consider giving this place another try. Almost $30 for a tasteless main and $18 for a tasteless appetizer is really not acceptable."
Very good Mediterranean food.,"If you are craving good Mediterranean food in town. This is the place to be. I suggest you book a table if you have a big group as it may be hard to get a table via walk in as it’s crowded. And reason being so crowded because the food is amazing. Chef is so personable and will try his best to greet you and make you feel at home. With 24 years of experience in the business, I am sure his meals will warm your heart.

We ate with a group of 6 and shared most of the dishes. Enough to fill our hungry tummy.

Will return for sure!"
Amazing food :),"I noticed the place by coincidence while looking for a place to have lunch. This is what i consider a hidden gem ! I tried the hummus with freshly baked pita bread, lahme bel ajin, shish tawooq and adana kebab..I enjoyed every bite :) taste just like delicious homemade food..the chef offered us a complimentary um ali for our dessert and it was one of the best I've ever tried :) definitely worth visiting"
Worst service ever,"There were only 3 small tables (including ours) when we walked in for lunch on Sat, 21 Dec before noon. The staff were busy chatting away. We placed our drinks order first n were only served after half an hour. Then there were more patrons walked in. After waited for an hour, our food were not ready while those who came after us have been served. I have to ask 3 servers about our food only to be told that they hv forgotten to key in our order. They were not even apologetic. I left the place n I will never want to step in to Piss-tachio ever again!!"
Worst experience of my life,"Went down to the restaurant around 11.30am with my family for the first time. Always wanted to try the place and have a good time, but until today. The place was not crowded. Ordered our drinks first and it took centuries to serve us. It’s only just a pot of tea and a cup of coffee. When we ordered our food, there is a young guy, tanned and without glasses, who took our order without writing it. Waited for another 1 hour and when we asked for our food from another staff, he just left without coming back. We asked another staff, a young lady staff, she came to us and stated our order was not keyed in. What kind of service is this? People who came in later than us had their food served while we are still waiting. So that means we, walk-in, customers have lesser attention than those who reserved their tables? If the place is crowded, we understand but it wasn’t and all the staffs are hanging at the counter. Furthermore, the person who took our order should come and apologize to us rather than letting his colleagues to handle his mistakes. Not even the manager or someone who is higher position came to us. So are you fit to be in this position when your staffs are in need of help and you just let them hold all the scoldings and all by the customers? This is not professional and we still have to pay. No service recovery, NOTHING! I should applaud for this “EXCELLENT” service. Bravo! So what if your food is good. We will not go there ever again. Also to let those who are going there for the first time, do take note!"
Disappointing service,"I had been looking forward to visiting this restaurant, however left feeling disappointed by the service received. I waited for 5 minutes before staff noticed me and took me to the table, and another 15 minutes before I eventually had to ask for a menu. Again we had to get the staff's attention to order.

We had the falafel to start, which was very yummmy. My husband had the sultan lamb, which would have been better had it been ordered as part of a sharing meal set. I had the vegetarian couscous and found the vegetables cooked very al dente and the dish generally to be fairly dry. The main courses were expensive for the quality received."
Good food and service,Went for dinner with my family. Ordered the tomahawk. Definitely will go back again and the pita bread is good too.
Perfection 👍🏼,"This is probably the Best place for Middle Eastern food in Singapore !
Delicious , healthy , freshly prepared, piping hot and beautifully presented.
Ambience was comfortable , staff efficient, friendly and attentive .
Reasonably priced for such refined good quality food .
We had an enjoyable and satisfying experience"
Amazing food.,"The food here is amazing and it well worth a visit. I had ribs, the pistachio salad and the babaganoush with bread. Plenty of food for two people. The restaurant is nestled away in a mall, so be sure to find it. You won’t need a booking for lunch, but you may want to reserve for evenings."
Great food,Almost every other dish on the menu is great. But a must try is the tomahawk and sultans delight. It may be on the pricey side but the lamb is one of the best I’ve had.
One of the best middle eastern restaurants,Please reserve a seat before you arrive here. They have real good food and its value for money. Their service is quick and with a smile. Do finish the meal with a dessert.
Singaporeans like Singary,"In addition to the familiar Middle Eastern dishes, you will also find unusual ones, like Mohamarra dip, Singary, Hünkar Beğending, etc, all very well executed. Because of the quality, it gets busy at meal times, and the service staff can be stretched. Special dishes are pricey, but lunch specials are quite reasonable."
A stroke of luck to find this gem in the commercial heart of Singapore,"During a recent Singapore visit, my wife and I were looking for a nice place to have dinner around Orchard Road where our hotel was located. I googled for the best restaurants in the area and came up with the usual suspects, high-end ones in 5-star hotels or well-known Chinese, Italian and French around the area. I booked one place in Paragon, but since we were ahead of schedule, we strolled along Orchard and enjoyed the scene with early Christmas decorations in mid-November lighting up Orchard's famous sidewalks.

As we passed Ion, I saw Wheelock Place and suggested we check it out since I hadn't seen anything highlighted in my web search, but knew it had a few restaurants tucked away in the upper floors. Scanning its directory, we spotted a Mediterranean place, one of my favorite cuisines, and headed up to Pistachio on L3. It was packed and fully booked, but Abigail, the waitress who met us, said that in case one particular table opened up she would hold it for us if we came back 30-45 min later. We came back 15 min later, and the table had been freed up and reserved for us by Abigail.

We didn't regret our decision. We ordered the Tabouleh (1/2 portion of a rather large normal order), the Falafel and the Shish Taouk, made up of grilled skewered spiced chicken with a spinach and rocket salad and a side of Arabic briyani rice. The Shish Taouk usually comes with saffron rice, but after reading the menu's forward message of owner/chef Khaled Elelimi, we asked for the briyani which he makes using ""premium, low-carb basmati rice grain... steamed with cinnamon sticks, onions and sunflower oil...""

Everything tasted delicious, especially when we mixed the very refreshing into the briyani and ate it with the very aromatic and succulent chicken pieces. To top off the meal, we had the pleasure of meeting Chef Khaled, during his frequent visits to the tables to see how guests were coming along. He shared his very interesting history and we ours, and we ended the evening enjoying a special Jordanian dates cake with vanilla ice-cream courtesy of the chef.

It was an unexpected and most enjoyable dining experience, and we will definitely visit again."
Restaurant with good quality food & good ambiance,"The new location at Wheelock Place is so central & convenient.
Seating capacity has also increased & service staff very attentive & friendly.
Food variety is good & quality of food is excellent.
We had the TOMAHAWK steak which Chef Khaled did it to perfection - all the favours were locked in the steak & it was excellent!
Will definitely be back for more."
Favourite Mediterranean grill,"This restaurant is fairly new and the first time we tried to go there, we called for reservations on the day itself but the restaurant was full because it was the weekend.

We finally managed to visit a few weeks later and made a reservation for Sunday.

We tried 3 of the dips and the portions are rather small so if you have a group of 4, you will need at least 3 kinds of dip for sharing. My favourite dip was MOHAMARRA which is Walnuts and pomegranate and do try the Lebanese bread.

Since we are meat eaters, we ordered the mixed grill which had 3 kinds of meat that came on skewers hanging on a rack which was 2 pax portions. I chicken was very well seasoned and grilled to perfection. It comes with delicious saffron rice on the side.

Menu is quite extensive and includes a lot of seafood and vegetarian options as well. I've been here twice and ordered the exact same things because they were just so tasty.

You could probably walk in on a weekday but you will need to book if you intend to eat there on the Friday or the weekends. The service staff are always busy and maybe understaffed or just not efficiency so be prepared to wait a bit for them to respond to you. We had to ask 4 times to get a water refill but once the food was ordered, it was served within a reasonable time."
Dinner,Exceptionable and delicious foods. Been there while they were in Zhong Shan mall. Menu has expanded. Chef and wife are hospitable. Excellent choice for a causal meal with friends and family or to bring visitors to.
New location is amazing,We ate many times at other location. This location so much better and the food the same but atmosphere service much better at new location. Tried a few different dishes this time was amazing.
Brilliant food,"Cannot fault the food which was so tasty, gorgeous flavours and perfectly cooked. A little expensive SGD 127 for 2 having 3 dishes and a pot of tea. It does not take Amex which lost it a point."
Excellent dinner!,"This is such a great place for middle eastern food. The lamb chop with moussaka - moussaka is mashed eggplant, baby capsicums and potatoes baked with cheese. This is a must try. It is so rich and tasty. Sultan’s delight - stewed lamb served with egg plant and cheese. Wonderful flavours and texture and zero carbs. Lots of greens to choose from as well. The perfect healthy meal. Love it."
Best Middle Eastern & Mediterranean food so far,"Third time visiting as the food is just too good! Although on the pricey side, the quality is great. I recommend getting the mixed grill, pita bread with hummus, and the sultan’s delight!!"
Lamb shoulder!!,We had a lunch feast of Slow-roasted whole lamb shoulder served with Arabic briyani rice and mixed nuts. Surprisingly tender with loads of flavor. Its quite big so I recommend it can be easily share between 3 to 4 people. Add some appetizers like the Pita bread with some dips and it becomes a full meal. Lunch for 6 cost $363
Yummy food at reasonable rates!,We ordered a meat platter with cous cous for two persons. The service was very good and even the owner / head chef came and chatted with us at our table. A very pleasant experience and I highly recommend this to one and all!
Tasty Middle Eastern Fast Food,We happened to walk into this restaurant and decided to try their Middle Eastern dishes. We opted for light and vegetarian dishes for a change. They have a nice selection of dips and we took the eggplant and the walnut dips. The adding of pomegranates is a refreshing change. The pita bread was served hot and authentic taste. We love the Algerian Vegetables Tagine. It was light and tasty! Price was reasonable too. Total cost plus a bottle of wine was S$172
Satisfied Lunch!,I wandered in with two friends on a Sunday for lunch and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff named Satis. The restaurant was filling up quickly but we managed to snag a table. He suggested us mommahara dips which was tasted great and delicious. We love it. Will recommend to our friends too. Overall satisfied with the service given by Satis and food taste awesome ❤️.
The Beef Melts Mike Butter,"I went to Pistachio for lunch with my girlfriend and parents for lunch the other day. Firstly, the service makes me feel very welcomed, especially because Chef Khaled himself takes the time to come out and greet and chat with everyone. The decor is unique and cozy, with Egyptian and Greek spices.

Now, the food — we ordered the beef rib on Biryani Rice. The meat melts in your mouth, you can taste the harmony of the tender meat and fat blending together with the seasoning and the fragrance of the ingredients they slow roast it with. The rice can be enjoyed wholly by itself without any help from the beef and you'll leave with a smile, trust me. I also ordered a Sultan's delight to share with my girlfriend. The lamb was very tender, I had no difficulty showing it, and the cheesy mashed aubergines it came with complemented it very well.

The sheer quality and heart behind making every single dish is very impressive. They make everything from scratch. And if you chat with Chef Khaled you'll get a glimpse of how passionate and dedicated a chef he is, and you can taste how he has influenced his chefs in his kitchen.

I highly reccomend esting at Pistachio. The food is worth the price you pay. You do not get such good and unique food just anywhere."
Fantastic,Every dish is a quality dish - the ingredients are top notch and it translates into the aromas. We had a lovely lunch here with the family and we will certainly be back! The chef cares for the quality and the diners experience and it shows in the authentic interactions with guests and his menu.
Best tomahawk steak in town,"Beef Tomahawk - Having enjoyed many tomahawks at different steakhouses and hotels, I can assure you this is the best I've had for years. Juicy and great flavor.

Fish - wild snapper (de-boned). Cooked just nice.

Saffron rice - highly recommend. It was so good we finished the whole plate and forgot to take photo.

Bread and Salad - great as starters."
Excellent food and service! Highly recommended for who loves Mediterranean food.,"We were delighted with the incredible flavors, excellent Mediterranean food and unique attention given by Chef Khaled Elelimi. Don't leave the restaurant before trying the Baklava."
Nice restuarant,very good taste .. real middle eastern food. Om Ali and shish tawook taste exactly what you can eat in Egypt.
Great Middle Eastern Food with Service,"My first time there to celebrate my mother's birthday together with wife and kiddos.

We ordered the Tomahawk steak, Grilled prawn singary, Tabouleh, Margherita Pide Pizza and Black Mussels.

A lot of food for 5 pax but we cleaned it all up. Too Yumz.

Chef Elelimi made sure all guests are comfortable by personally stopping over all the tables.

Definitely will be coming back soon for more grilled meat!"
"Great food, not so great portions","This is a lovely restaurant, in terms of food, decor and service, but it's tough for me to give it 5 stars because the prices are very high and portions too small.

Five of us had the Pistachio Mix Grill, vegetarian pide, grilled singary (prawns), pita bread with hummus, baba ghanoush and mohamarra, cheese boregi, Um Ali and konafeh - everything was delicious.

The hummus was super creamy and the cheese boregi was stuffed to the gills with feta cheese, housed in a thin and flaky pastry. The mix grill consisted of two small lamb chops, one skewer of beef kebab and one skewer of chicken kebab, atop a tiny portion of saffron rice. The lamb was tasty could be more juicy; the beef came in a lovely mint sauce and the chicken was tender and juicy. The rice was excellent too but far too little. The grilled singary (king prawns and baby shrimp) were very good but again, cost a lot of money for the portion.

The Um Ali (it's like a soggy bread pudding) and konafeh are very good.

I would highly recommend this restaurant if you want to give yourself a treat, but if you're on a budget and want good Mediterranean food, look elsewhere."
Fun and noisy!,"The restaurant was really busy, super noisy and crowded. The Service team looked rather stressed, and we had to wait a long time for the various courses. Their menu was large and interesting. We ordered a range of dishes to try as this was our first time here. The Falafel was dry and disappointing served with too little hummus, the skinny fried spinach rolls were not exciting, the pistachio salad was bland n average, the Iskandar Kebab with very thin and tasteless slices of beef was average.
the long pita bread was good for sharing and fun! The lobster bisque was thick, well balanced and delicious! We loved their Baba Ganoush,, lamb chops with moisakka dish was interesting - we loved the mousakka!! Sultan’s Delight was yummy- served with baba ganoush,. The chicken kebab was tender and the best! The dessert of Konafeh was complex, exciting and truly a Middle Eastern treat! Not too sweet but pricy for the complexity of the dish."
"Great food, excellent service","We had a dinner gathering there last night. The food was so tasty and delicious, and the service is excellent. Especially this gentlemen called Satis. Thumbs up for Chef Khaled! He is such a passionate and knowledgeable chef."
Simply Delicious,"Love the food here. The aroma of freshly baked bread; well seasoned grilled meats; fresh salads, etc. Been a few times and still looking forward to it."
Great food & service,"Saturday we had lunch at Pistachio. We had two mixed grills, misakah, hummus , salad and baba ghanough , not to forget the freshly baked pita bread.
For desert we had Om Aly mmmmm so delicious.
Chef Khaled was there making the rounds to make sure everyone was satisfied and happy. Great personal touch.
If you’re visiting Singapore you’ll be sorry if you give Pistachio a miss.
The servers( were very helpfull and attentive ( in spite of it being a full house) great food and service"
Gathering,Delicious meals and service was awesome !!! It is greatly recommended to come !!! Worth it! Ill definitly come again!!! Definitely a 9/10 rating😊😊😊😊
Lovely service n excellent food,"Amazing food and service! Especially the jordanian date cake! Just a pity that i had to witness an ‘ugly’ customer today. I think he was drunk coz he kicked up a big ruckus with the waitress who was unfailing apologetic, patient and polite. He was accusing her of cheating him. Apparently all she did was made a mistake in the bill which was already rectified in the same bill. Gosh. What a bumer as his lack of manners kinda ruin the usually cosy n nice atmosphere. Pls ban such customers from ever returning, pistachios grill! You deserve better and so do your other appreciative customers!"
"Food delayed, but service is satisfactory","Went for lunch at Pistachio with my family. The food looks delicious but food is delayed. It takes like 50 minutes plus for it. Quite disappointed with that. However, the service provided by the guy named Satis was satisfied to my family and me. He took care of us. He was so friendly to us even though we were disappointed on food delayed. Just had a good service by him. Many thanks to him."
