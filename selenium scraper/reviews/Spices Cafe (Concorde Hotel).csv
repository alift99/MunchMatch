CNY dinner,"We had our CNY reunion dinner here. Actually it was held at the ballroom, but the food was from this restaurant. The buffet was well done, sufficient variety of dishes and desserts. The hot food stations was yummy too. Seating-wise was ok. Not too cramped. Overall a great experience although it did feel a bit like a wedding dinner."
Always enjoy my dining experience here.,"Dined here for lunch time Peranakan buffet a number of times over the years.
Have always enjoyed the food.
All the staff at Spices cafe are definitely to be commended ; always helpful, pleasant &
service oriented, whether it is the hostess, captain, waiting staff or cooks at the different stations.
They’re so helpful.
I will continue to dine here and definitely recommend this establishment."
Disappointed,The selection for the buffet was very limited and taste wise it was just OK. Nothing great. Won't be visiting again.
My go to buffet restaurant,"Service was excellent and food was great , price per pax is affordable with discount. Highly Recommended"
Disappointed and place seems understaffed,Limited buffet selection. Went there for their crab buffet but staff repeatedly refused to take our orders for the crab until the very end. Had to keep asking for the crabs before they finally served it. Seems like the restaurant cannot deliver on their crab buffet.
Value for money,Returning customer for many years. So far the most value for money Xmas buffet even though this year the price goes up a little.
Good varieties of seafood,"There are unlimited of crabs, prawns & satay. The main fish is nice but always run out. The herbal prawn soup is nice. It seems that it took longer time to serve the crabs.
It would be great if there is free soft drinks as the buffet price $75+++ is above average…"
Buffet lunch with friends on a Saturday afternoon,"Buffet spread mainly consist of Asian food in particular more towards paranakan food. Buffet lunch does not serve western soup or bread at all, also no Japanese cuisines like sushi or sashimi . Only hot drinks are coffee n tea. No juices or soft drinks are served. A little different from usual buffet spread I have been to before ."
Consistent food and service! And thank you Rita for being a gracious host! :),"It was my 2nd visit and the food and service was consistent.

Restaurant gives us a very homey vibes.
Everyone was friendly and the buffet food selection and quality was still good.

Special mention to Rita for being such a gracious and sweet host! Thank you for performing the special song for my parent’s wedding anniversary. It was extra memorable!

We definitely look forward to be back! :)"
Spices Cafe,Spices Cafe has an amazing Peranakan buffet lunch at a very reasonable price for seniors. Food presentation and quality excellent. Staff very attentive. Would like to single out Rita who has been there since we started going to Spices. 3 years away (due to covid restrictions) haven't dimmed her beautiful personality
Value for money,"First visit to this Peranakan Buffet. Laksa gravy just nice not overpowered by too much coconut milk. Returned for second bowl. Chicken and beef satay were tasty, meat soft, not hard. Surprised to see grated pineapple for the satay. Rest of dishes were delicious, especially ayam buah keluak. Nyonya kueh was cut into bite size pieces. Durian Pengat was a favourite, although a little sweet.
Friendly and attentive service from the Manager and staff. We were entertained by the friendly female waitress.
The pricing is enticing to return for another lunch soon. Expansive variety to try, couldnt sample everything. Being a weekday, small crowd."
Quality of food,"Cuttlefish was overcooked, is very tough and unchewable. Stingray was tough and dry. Prawns texture is mushy, and the jellyfish has a very strong fishy taste. Dessert still has the same standard though. However, quality of food has deteriorated over the years as we used to visit for Mother's Day celebration as my mum loves the local food selection. This recent tasting of food quality made me think twice about booking my reunion dinner buffet with Spices cafe."
Worst seafood buffet ever,"Worst seafood buffet ever. Minimal selection, seafood counter is in a mess look like leftover, sushi and oyster are empty 80% of the time. Slow top up, basically food sucks.

Free flow crab not on counter have to order separately and they make you wait 30mins. When the portion comes it extremely small, seem to be short of staff, can't seem to find any around to take food orders. Slow to clear the plates. Horrible. Will never recommend to anyone"
Good food and staff,"The food is very good, and all the staff makes you feel at home. This is my regular hangout. Must come and try it!!"
Average Joe,"Limited selection and also not the freshest of seafood food. For the price paid (around $65/pax), wouldn’t call it a great deal."
Nice ambient and good service,The ambient is nice and informal. The service is good. Food spread seemed to have lessen. Value for money for seniors.
Good place Good food,"There is variety of food, love the kuay pie tee, laksa and etc. Staff was friendly and helpful. Price is reasonable too. Will recommend my friend and family."
Dinner Buffet,"Very good service level & promptness in refilling the food. However, can prolly add a little more varieties to the food."
Friendly staff,Son and Hub enjoyed the black pepper crab. Chilli crab was too tomato-ish for our liking. Mentaiko lobster was much tastier than cheese. Tomato soup was lovely. Son loved the sushi. Durian and mint dessert were our favourite
Dinner Buffet,Good food..good service. I will recommend to friends. I would love to have more selection though. All the best to the friendly staff!
Good peranakan food to experience,"The service was great , food is well balanced. At almost the end of the buffet, there was no replenishment."
Fantastic,"The food was so tasty and fresh and there was a great assortment, service was awesome and friendly, definitely value for money"
Not to my expectations,Chope app easy to use . Staff service was excellent; food average. Not much variety. Drink has to order separately as it is not included in the buffet . Only plain water and hot drinks are available.
Great buffet,"Upon arrival of the spices cafe we were greeted with a warm welcome, expectation were up to standard. Cooked Food and seafood are freshly prepared served with lobster and crabs. Service a tiptop . Thankyou for the great experience."
Lunch at Spice Cafe,Made the right choice to have Peranakan food at Spice cafe with my brother n sis I law who came back from overseas n longing for such food .
Excellent,We got a dinner promotion. The food is really nice and the service excellent. Lots of choices to eat and fresh sea foods.
Miss u so much,"Have been waiting for them to reopen their buffet lunch. Glad to see familiar face (Rita), service is still as good as before. Thank you Rita for being so nice and thoughtful as before. Food is still so good."
service and food are V.good,waiting time is too long. there should be free flow of either ice lemon tea or an orange juice for diners so that we do not have to start with coffee. Good food and good service provided by staff once we entered into the cafe. thanks.
Good place to have dinner together,"We were excited for the recent opening of Spices Cafe buffet dinner and in our recent visit with 10 diners, 9 of which have been there before, we enjoyed the usual food and environment for a get together among old friends. We like the food and something is missing, there should be free flow of either ice lemon tea or an orange juice for diners so that we do not have to start with coffee."
Buffet Dinner - Harvest of the sea,"Good food and good service provided by staff once we entered into the cafe. Will revisit again, thanks."
good buffet,buffet was good as selection was good and staff friendly too. lots of options for seafood and desserts too.
Buffet At Spices,"Disappointed with the chili crab, need to order before they serve and it was not communicated to us. manage to overheard someone order then it strike us that we need to place an order for it. The crab was quite small and the chili crab sauce was very diluted and does not taste good. The bonus part was there was a one time serve of half lobster which was a bit more decent. The rest of the buffet spread was average. Not a place where I will come again"
Lunch at Spices Cafe,"Buffet spread was very good. Some areas of improvement are in kuay chap (a bit salty), oyster omelet has mainly eggs, tee tou thng pig intestine was tough (soup was good). Laksa was very good. Rojak made for us by the nonya staff was superb. Jui hee cuttlefish was very good. Unfortunately there was no Sri Lankan chilli crab on that day Tuesday. Highly recommended for a good lunch."
Good,"There to celebrate a friend’s birthday and bday girl is satisfied with all the seafood and exceptionally good Laksa that puts Katong Laksa to shame I have enjoyed the oysters, black pepper crab and black seseme ice cream"
Great,It was my favourite buffet before the pandemic. Now after it’s reopening it is still the best for value on my list. The seafood is fresh and free flow of Sri Lankan crab dishes is something you won’t even have at other more expensive buffet places
Nyonya Buffet lunch,One of the best Buffet lunch we have had and the pricing is reasonable. Service was good and nice ambience. Lots of variety to choose from and the nyonya food is authentic.
Food,Variety of food has dropped significantly. Was much better before covid. Hope they can improve on that.
Fresh oysters! Worthy!,"I like oysters there and soup! Price is very worth for sashimi, lobster and also unlimited order of crabs! Would like to visit again!"
good foods and service,worth the money my friends love the food and the staff. it’s was a big surprise for us. the steam finish is so nice
Great service,Nice ambience… clean and nicely spaced.. staff was friendly and prompt… Went for breakfast it was lovely to start the day with the variety..
Spices Dining,"It was a pleasing visit, there was a good range of food selections, top ups done frequently, staff courteous and friendly, food quality consistent and match that of March 2020"
"Nice ambience, good food and service!","I have gone for the weekend buffet lunch here that I last visited in 2020 before it was shut down due to the lockdown of Covid19. The cafe has just reopened it's operations on 1st June.

The cafe is cosy, bright and spacious and I have requested for the sofa seat. That's very comfortable. It's quite crowded considering it's the school vacation!

The food spread here is mainly Peranakan and local themed dishes and overall they are nice.

Some of the yummy food included the popiah (that is prepared on the spot by the chef and as such there's a queue since the preparation will take some time), oyster omelette (fragrance), old cucumber soup with meat balls (flavourful and thick), rojak (even got cuttlefish and taupok among it's other usual ingredients though the cuttlefish was somehow overburnt), otak, sambal fish, curry mutton, satay, the nonyakuehs and pastries. Nice. And the desserts of gingko nut with logan white fungus soup is yummy too.

And for some dishes, they were not good such as the sambal prawns that were disappointing. Although cooked with sambal sauce that provided some flavour and taste, they were initially not that fresh, their flesh were hard and stale, like they have been frozen for quite some time. And the chap chai was bland, possibly because the gravy is too watery.

Coffee, tea, desserts, ice cream and fresh cut fruits are inclusive in the buffet too. And good if they can provide some additional flavours of tea via sachets (like english breakfast, earl grey, green tea etc) instead of a pot of ""black tea"" and for coffee wise too, good to have cuppacino or latte as well instead of just ""coffee"" and expresso. (possibly because of the old coffee machines that do not have such options)

Service staff are friendly, helpful and efficient, i.e. serving food and clearing used plates and in particular, Rita (think she's the supervisor or manager) who dress in the traditional kebaya outfit, did dropby every table to solicit for feedback and initiate conversations. And she did remember my mum and seemed she recognized many diners who happen to be returning guests like us! And the chefs are friendly too.

Overall, we do enjoy our dinning here as before. Will revisit again soon and try out their dinner!

Great Nyonya food and excellent service,"Our family came here for my dad’s birthday. My family loves Nyonya food so they decided to come here upon recommendations given by family friends.

We’ve been to countless buffets like ritz Carlton but I must say that the service here is impeccable, it’s not grand but it’s homely. You can tell that the service staffs have been here for Long.

We’ve received exceptional service from Rita. She made us a plate of rojak (she didn’t have to). She goes around to tables to talk to the diners like we’re family. It’s a very warm feeling. You wouldn’t be able to have this kind of experience in other restaurants.

I rarely write reviews for restaurants but I felt that there’s a need for the world to know about this little gem.

Rita, you’re a gem.

We look forward to coming back here ◡̈

* there’s a promotion now: for the price of 3 adults, 1 additional dines for free.

You’re welcome guys."
Fantastic Peranakan (Nonya) buffet,"A local friend took us to this place to try all the Singaporean specialties at a buffet - Satay, Laksa, Mee Siam, Popiah and lots of Nonya desserts. Their mains included large prawns, beef rendang, assam chicken and sticky rice or jasmine rice to go with them. There were also some dim sum on the buffet. Too many things to try! They have a discount for children and for seniors (over 55)."
Great Weekend High Tea~,"It has been 9 years since our last visit here and so we decided to return to try. It was weekend and so the cafe was having the weekend high tea, from 12pm - 4pm.

Located just next to the lobby, the cafe has undergone some renovations and now it is very cosy, nice, trendy and comfortable. Lovely ambience and good to spend a few hours here over some food and catching up with friends.

Just before we were led to our table, the staff took temperature of every diner in wake of the Covid-19 virus scare and also requested all diner to write down the name and contact number. Good effort as it's the first hotel/restaurant that we have encountered thus far in doing so (we dined 1-2 times weekly at restaurants/cafes).

In terms of food for the day we visited, it was mostly Singapore local street food that was good. Some of the food items included Kuey Chap (with side dishes like braised pork, bean curd, egg and pork intestines), Roti Prata, Rojak, Oyster Omelette, Satay, Popiah and Kueh Pieti, Laksa, Fried Vermicelli, Otak, Rice Dumpling, Deep fried and dim sum items like Siew Mai, Char Siew Su, Seafood Roll etc. On the side, there were Salmon and assortment of Sushi maki, seafood section with fresh prawns and mussels, a dessert and fresh fruits counter, and coffee/tea counter is located way back of the cafe.

Overall, the food were nice and yummy. Those that were extremely good and must try include: Popiah (very good), Laksa (flavourful and not too oily or milky), Roti Prata (on the spot the chef will make it and not those pre-made, crispy and nice). The fresh cut fruits were nice with quite a wide variety. Desserts like the durian pengat and gingko nuts with yam paste, nonya kuehs were all very yummy and nice!

Food items that required improvement were the Sushi maki, very hard and not fresh. While the kuay chap soup was nice, the kuay teow were overly torn into bits which by right should be narrow, straight and long manner. Next, coffee and tea. Although there were coffee machines, but only one type of coffee was available. It would be great to have others like Cuppacino, Latte, Expresso etc. Likewise, no tea bags were available (not to mention if they have green tea, earl grey etc) but just red tea in the glass jar. Great to provide a handful of variety.

In our last visit 9 years ago, they had bak kut teh (pork ribs soup), prawn noodles, chwee and soon kueh, mee siam etc. Perhaps good to bring more of these food and leave the sushi out, since it's Singapore theme street food! Having teh tarik may be great to go along with the roti prata?

Service staff were friendly, attentive and efficient in clearing used plates and utensils and also initiated conversations with diners. A few of the crew, most likely from Taiwan, were also very polite and fast in setting up tables for dinner.

It's a good value for money considering the ambience, service and variety of food.

We did enjoy our dinning here and will surely return again in the not too distant near future."
High Tea @ Spices Cafe,"Always a place in mind for gathering or celebrations for birthday, etc. Weekend high tea choice for long seating and good spread of variety of foods choice."
Excellent buffet in town,Food was better than at my last visit. Pleasantly surprised that the popiah has improved so much. Will certainly go again
Highly recommended,"If you crave peranakan cuisine as well as desserts, this is the place to be! Pleasant ambience, comfortable seating too."
A wonderful place to return to,"During our first visit to Singapore in December 2016-January 2017 we were recommended to have the Singapore Flavours buffet lunch at Spices café. It was one of the many highlights of our visit and so we returned three years later to find very little had changed, indeed it was almost déjà vu to be greeted warmly by Rita as we were in 2015 and see the one of the same chefs appear from the kitchen. The diversity, quality and quantity of food on offer was of the same high standard and the prices remain, particularly for those classified as senior citizens, very reasonable. While so many things change so many times and so quickly, it was a really lovely experience to return to a place where the high standards and quiet, welcoming atmosphere have not changed at all. We hope that will remain the case so that we may enjoy another buffet lunch at Spices when we next return to Singapore."
best seafood in singapore at a good price,Excellent service and delicious food great variety as well. Located in the Concorde hotel it is easy to get to by public transport from the airport.
Great Food Great Deals Great Place!,First time here for dinner buffet and i really like their food selections and the place. but it will be more awesome if there's more ice cream selection to choose.
Good spread,Very good spread in terms of variety dessert main course. I paid deposit in advanced so there is no service charge n gst
Restaurant's Services,My family and I had a wonderful time at spices cafe as the ambience was delightful and the services from the staffs is definitely commendable.
Great restaurant at the Concorde hotel,Very good buffet and excellent dining off the a la carte menu. Very friendly staff and good atmosphere.
Very good choices & great food,Ate here three or four times when staying at hotel - excellent buffet and very good a la carte menu. very friendly staff and great atmosphere.
Anniversary dinner,Food quality was comparable to other dinner buffet restaurants that we've been to. Food variety was less than other buffet resto. Service was excellent.
Dinner Buffet SPICE CAFE,"I was searching for an appropriate place to celebrate my son’s graduation on 3 Dec 2019 and after comparing other places I decided to use Concorde Spice Cafe. What made me choose this cafe was because of the Chef Sunny Goh whose expertise in local and international cuisine is of a very high standard. I am Glad to say my party of 10 was not disappointed with the variety of dishes laid out and the highlight of the dinner was the bake lobster done to perfection. There were lots of local and Japanese cuisine as well and I say it’s value for money inspite of this festive period where hotels usually raise their prices.
For lunch I was informed that there would be Peranakan Cuisine and I know Chef Goh plays a big part in this as he was one of the main chefs during his days at the Old Apollo Hotel which was famous for his Peranakan dishes. I must make a trip for lunch soon to try lunch at the Spice Cafe. I must also commend the service staff who were attentive and helpful despite the cafe being quite full."
SERVICE,buffet food was good except service was slow as there was only 2 service staffs serving for the whole night despite there was 2 big groups of dinners . crabs was served cold too
Buffet lunch on weekend,Not worth it. Spread is miserable. Food taste below average. Malay male staff rather chit chat than to get me a spoon upon request. I rather starve than to revisit in future
Spices Cafe weekend high tea,"Food spread is good. Overcrowded event goers. Coffee machine for espresso with no clear button indication though LCD has, that's only after pressing button. flow very small, I need to press 2 times to get my espresso. anyway, the taste of espresso is good!"
Good foods!,"Can’t get to try chili crab but felt surprise to see “abacuses stir fry minced meat” which is rare find neither in restaurant nor any buffet, spices cafe should keep this dish for every session :) petai udang also delicious and deep fried fuzhou oyster cake and laksa are our favourites!"
Nice buffet,Good food & entertainment. Love the laksa and the Ayam buah Kaluak. Nice songs too. Happened to go on one of those days (twice a month) where they had oldies songs in diff language
Harvest of the sea buffet Concorde Orchard Road hotel,"Love the good size , fresh and juicy shucked oysters they served here. The steamed whole fish dish is also excellent and is replenished frequently . Crab dishes are served ala carte and we had the chilly crab , salted egg and black pepper version . Salted egg crab is good . The black pepper version is too salty whereas the chilly crab misses the mark altogether. The crustacean highlight , the lobster with mentaiko sauce is yummy . I love the flavorful clam chowder soup pot, chockful of clams & potatoes , so thick and soul filling hehe.
Their dessert display is awesome .The all time favourite dessert , the durian pengat is served in tiny liquor glasses and is as good as it gets.
Thumbs up for the ambience and decor of the Spice cafe . Elegant and just the right amount of understated grandness . Service staff is polite and obliging .
Will come back again for sure."
Best Peranakan Food!,"A friend recommended the restaurant and decided to bring mom and god-parents for lunch. Heard better to make reservation so did it through Chope.
We absolutely LOVE it! Thank goodness we were there early (god-ma is wheelchair bound) it was later very crowded. Staff were friendly and the food was great! Haven't had such authentic peranakan for a long time! So glad we went there. Planning to bring some overseas friends in Oct. Thanks Chope!"
Dinner buffet food that is not even 50% accurate to the menu sent to me!,"Was my 1st visit to this place last weekend with my family & I asked for their dinner menu to have a feel what kind of food will be in the dinner spread.
I can understand that buffet food can be change based on availability but how can your menu & the actual spread is not even 50% similar???? The soup was not the same at all, most of the hot dishes were not the same as well, saving grace was your seafood & sashimi didn’t go missing from the spread.
I guess maybe your kitchen has issue maintaining the food menu?? Cos I saw your Restaurant was not even full & replenishment was so slow, is the chef inside the kitchen changing the menu to another item??
If it is true, then it is false advertising when you sending out menu that won’t even last beyond 8pm in the evening over the weekends!
I would also like to feedback that your crabs portion serving size is horrendously small, does the management even see what the kitchen is doing to destroy your business? when we asked the staff why is the crab serving so small, their answer was I can get you more portion if you need with a sheepish smile. That only shows us that even the service staff knows what is going on in the kitchen. We consumers have plenty of options to dine out & I don’t see why we should be coming back to your spices cafe again."
Disappointed.................,"What a major disappointment! It seems that either there is no F & B head or the management could not care less about the cafe's customers! PLEASE WAKE UP & DO SOMETHING about the frequent complains of the replenishment of the buffet!

I am really appalled at that the number of EMPTY bain maries...if the cafe is not interested in timely replenishment than serve ala carte meals then!! You are really CHEATING the customers by advertising your beautiful buffet advertisements.

The only good thing that I can say is that the service staff are really friendly & courteous & efficient.....KUDOS to them........if only the F & B personnel can have the same attitude!"
A great place to meet up with friends,"The food was good, oyster was fresh and juicy and the complimentary lobster was a nice touch. The senior discount swing the decision point to choose Spices over other hotel buffets."
Dinner at Spices Cafe on 23 August,"Had dinner on 23rd August at spices cafe concorde.
We were having the harvest of the sea buffet.
The service by the staff were attentive and pleasant.
Food were a different story.
The cheese lobsters were overcooked and mushy.
The crab cooked in chilli are mushy and not fresh.
The dessert, durian Panget tasted sour and have to informed the staff to change the entire batch.

I am a frequent customer for the cafe but this evening experience has made me think twice to return to this cafe. For I feel the food and hygiene standards of this restaurant is questionable, please buck up or you will be made obsolete is this highly competitive industry."
Very arrogant and rude waitress on our 2nd visit,"First visit on late Aug 2. were lovely as we had two wonderful staff taking care of us and we got to choose both of Asian Menu and Late night staff.

2nd visit on Aug 3 was really a DISASTER! We were served by staff Maria from the Philippines. She was not very welcoming att all and made me feel like I was an intruder at the restaurant. Never said ""welcome"". She then limited our choice if menu to only Late night snack and never told why they could serve it the night before.My mom were more or less forced to order a pizza, which she never eat usually. She was actually craving for asian food. Maria then had the nerve to correct my choice of drink. I said Coke Zero..she looks wierd at me and says""..its called Coke light..NOT coke Zero"". It was such an awkward dinner vibes. Later on when my mom and her fiancé finishef eating, and I was still enjoying my club sandwich..Maria starts clearing the table without even asking if it was ok for her to do so. It is a very rude thing to do when someone is still eating. I will never ever come back to Spices Café if that kind of service is accepted. She needs to be reminded of how good customer service should be. We were not very happy about her customer service knowledge."
Good buffet,"Valuable and comparable buffet in Singapore, especially on weekdays. If u r a crab lover, u must be there."
Nice ambience with good value,"This is my 3rd visit in spice cafe. Had tried their high tea n dinner.Mus say both r with good value. Ambience was perfect for gatherings.
Service rendered with a smile n clearing of table was fast n efficient .
Had a last min request , for a nice birthday cake surprise.
They have prepared not one but two individual cakes for 2 friends birthdays ,with nicely simple presentation.

Really enjoyed all my visit at spice cafe n Kudos to the staff for their efficiency.

Well recommended n will see u soon again:)"
Nice buffet,"Nice and good buffet cafe. With good tasted foods and well selected items and very happy with the fruits and cakes offered, will recommend for good lunch buffet"
Limited selection and nothing is good,"This is the first buffet which doesn't motivate me to go back for more food. Very disappointing spread, quality and taste! Sad to say, the sliced watermelon and (softened) lime sorbet were the only things that I find nice there."
Crab buffet,"Go early because the kitchen has limited supply of crabs. Although it is a buffet, it is a request basis and you will not be able to order once the stock finished. Salted egg crab was the best. Chili crab was abit too sweet and lack Unami. Crab is not the freshest, but can do with it. The grill section was quite disappointing. Meat was tough. Not the best ingredients. Laska was good."
Excellent food great service,The staff at Spices in the Concorde Hotel Singapore provide outstanding service and are always ready to help. The food is of a high standard yet reasonably priced. I always enjoy eating there alone or with friends. A great place.
BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION HIGH TEA BUFFET,"Good supply and quality of buffet spread, especially durian mousse.
They come in small glass cups and most popular dessert.

Notice that every time one lot out of the kitchen to the buffet and in split seconds
gone. However, have no fear, top ups are also speedy and generous.

Generally food variety is good and fresh."
lUNCH BUFFET AT SPICES CAFE CONCORDE HOTEL,"Visited Spices Café frequently for weekday lunch or weekend Tunch (12-5pm).
Best : Their food spread is always good especially the every tasty Laksa, pig stomach soup and buah keluak. The newly added oyster cake is very good.
Down side : The nonya kuehs quality need to be improved as the cakes are hard and no taste of coconut milk. The popiah ingredients lack the nonya bite (is it because there is no hae-bee and prawns inside)? Rojak sauce also lack the punch.
Overall, it was still a good place for a decent meal. I hope they can improve the above."
Great restaurant.,The seafood buffet was fantastic and good value for money. The staff were very polite and attentive.
Happy have Senior citizen promotion,"Happy to have senior citizen promotion. But hope it could be cheaper or nett pricing. Food is good. But standard of food drop. Previously I went there, the food seem to be nicer. Staff are attentive, courteous and friendly."
Nice breakfast,"For breakfast, the restaurant is mostly not crowded. Food selection is decent, but doesn’t seem to change from day to day, so should improve a little bit on that aspect. Service is decent, almost had a problem on the 1st day, but they managed to resolve that immediately."
Dinner Gathering,Not many variety of food. Food quality was average too. Perhaps can consider to change the menu to a better quality of food. Service was not too bad.
Don’t waste your time,Time wasted;( There is no free flow of crab. It was out of stock. And I only manage to order 1 plate only.
Spices cafe,"The theme of the buffet was harvest of the sea .

The crab feast was really disappointed as the crabs was not really fresh and all were “ meashy” in texture . Either not fresh or not cooked properly .

Other dishes on the buffet were nice .

The chef counter at the grille food was slow and we understand due mulfunction of the stove and the cooking time is longer ."
Spices Cafe,"Our group went because we heard about the peranakan spread included in the buffet. Wide variety of local fare from satay to popiah, laksa, rojak. otah as well as ayam buah keluak, assam pedas, and pig stomach soup. We received excellent service from Rita. The bonus was the discount given to senior citizensaged 55 and above."
Walkers,We have a wonderful time together at the cafe. Ms Rita service was Excellent. Should have more variety we missed the chilly flower crab and black vinegar pig throttle
Great Services,Great services from the team at Spices. Spread of the buffet is pretty decent. Highly recommended. Will visit again
Spices Cafe,Good food and excellent service especially from Rita. Will come again. I wonder why you all are asking us to put in at least 100 words. Feedback need not be that long. We are also very busy people and we cant write an essay on our experience. Please amend your requirement otherwise it is tiring to give feedback.
Standard plummet. Will never visit again.,"Visit this cafe since 2016 Jan whereby you get to choose different cooking of crabs. Last visit was May 2019. Tried the chilli and salted egg crabs. Crab size were small, many parts were not cleaned properly and worst the flesh were mushy. Very very disappointed."
Great Value & Service for the Buffet.,Food was decent and service was excellent. Wait staff cleared soiled dishes in a jiffy and food was replenished fairly quickly too.
Slightly below average seafood buffet for the price,"Brought my family there mainly because of the ""unlimited"" order-to-cook crab. However, the crab were not that fresh. Note that small size mud crabs were used instead of Sri Lanka crabs. But the one-time order half lobster was great. The oysters and sashimi were just average. The hot plate station had sotong, stingray, prawns and shell types, but they did not taste good mainly due to the oil used, as everything tasted the same as the oil used. Variety of other dishes available was not fantastic but the freshness and variety of fruits and desserts made up for it."
Value for Money,Oyster very fresh. Sashimi also. Good variety of dishes. Special price for Seniors a great incentive for a family event.
Terrible reservation system!! Awful food too,"Called me up to 5 times for confirmation of reservation, and the first call got my name and timing all wrong.
The spread is pretty awful and the crab is so small that I can barely see meat. Like size of a baby carrot. Yup, I’m being serious. Although subsequently, the crab size have gotten slightly bigger, but it’s still small.
Lastly, had a stomachache after dining at spices cafe."
Senseless pricing structure and average food quality,"Food quality has dropped significantly since the last time I was there. Some corners were cut of drinks offering (i.e. tea is now in pots and not a variety of teabags, cut cheeses is gone from the spread as well, etc.). The taste of the oyster omelet has dropped to a level that it does not resemble one anymore.

Booking online is SGD 31.00 per adult but for seniors is SGD 29.00 on-site. Booking on Chope for 2 pax, 1 senior 1 adult results in me getting charged 2 x SGD 31.00. Not sure why so, but I find it senseless. I will leave it to the wider audience to decide."
.,some of the sashimi selections were not up to standard and did not taste as good as before. Service was a bit slow this time as well.
Third visit,"My third visit with my family. Good food spread, fresh oysters and basic sashimi. Complimentary foie gras tasted good."
"Great value, great food but a tad cramp","Value for money, staff are all friendly and food is good. The only problem is the seats are too near to each other, making it a little difficult to move around in the restaurant."
"Great food, lots of choice","Good locations, services are good, food are fresh (espically on the cold cuts food). No time limit we had a great gathering chating till the cafe is closing."
Excellent,"We have been here several times and never fail me. Nice food, good service and pleasant atmosphere. Rita is very friendly and sociable. She makes you feel so good that as if she is an old friend of yours."
No REAL Sri Lankan Crabs,The menu said Sri Lankan crabs but what we got instead was measly flower crabs. So that was a good trick this restaurant played.
Dinner buffet quality could be improved,"We enjoyed the one-time order of the lobster and the laksa during the dinner buffet.
The durian penyet was not thick enough and the other dishes cannot be compared with the those from the lunch buffet which includes orh luak, kueh pie tie, spring rolls, pig trotters in black vinegar and pig stomach soup."
