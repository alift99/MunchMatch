Dinner buffet - Poor quality and absolutely not value for money,"Picked this place because we didn't plan ahead and all other places were fully booked on boxing day.

Service was good (hence the 1 star). Food was awful and variety was very limited. It was very quiet in the restaurant. I think there are only 6 groups of us on one of the busiest day for restaurants!

Prawns were fresh but all other items at the seafood on ice section were not. Hot food, salad bar and Japanese Corner tasted average at best. The turkey (which was why we went in the first place) was so tough that my husband said he could definitely cook it better (and that's true! He made our turkey every year except this year).

Overall, very disappointing experience. Really one of those places where I will not return even if it is free!"
Happy to be back for our 30th anniversary,"We dated often 33 years ago and got married there. Had our CNY dinner at Li Bai this year and decided to go to our old haunt at the Dining Room for our anniversary dinner. Sadly due to the festive season we could not get our ice burger but we had a good wagyu burger and Nasi goreng. When Pansy heard we are celebrating our anniversary, she kindly arranged that the dessert we ordered be complimentary with a beautiful message written. Her heartfelt wishes touches us just as the good services from the team and May Thu was very warm in her services as well."
Wedding on 12.11,"We chose Sheraton to host our wedding lunch banquet after viewing several other hotels and it was the best decision ever. Valerie was our wedding co-ordinator and she gave us great guidance and advice as we planned towards our wedding, which included solemnisation at waterfall pavilion and tea ceremony. On the actual day, Mei Yi was our banquet manager, Phyo our AV tech and Chef Gan, our banquet chef. The Sheraton team is really experienced in hosting wedding banquets from pacing the time for you, helping me with my dress as I go up and down stage, AV testing, food tasting, to ensuring that the food quality is up to standard. Their friendly and helpful service really put us at ease to truly enjoy the journey and our big day. Thank you!"
Good quality lunch with open kitchen,"Came here for a business lunch and was generally impressed. Food was excellent - a wonderful mushroom soup, and delicious barramundi with winged green beans as the main. Service generally attentive and not over-bearing, although I was a bit taken aback by having the main served at the same time as our starter (or about 2 minutes after to be more accurate). I liked the open kitchen too - always a positive. Finally, I understand the laksa was very good from one of my fellow diners!"
Food is under expectation,"The worst ever hotel buffet. First, varieties were limited. And secondly, must mentioned the food quality and one word to describe, inedible. The ngohiang was Hard and taste weird like left over a few days. The cold crab also tasted weird and almost tasteless."
Unpleasant Dining Experience,"The thongs was too hot which used to take food. We had feedback it to the manager in-charge but it seems that their excuse given is not acceptable, as they said this is the best way for them to place the thongs. The chef was standing at the buffet area. When we asked one of the Indian dishes name spell with the alphabet ""M"", she can't even tell what meat. Actually it was chicken. This restaurant don't provide any cold drinks not even ice water. Need to pay for ice water if you needed it."
Won’t come back again.,"1. Can’t believe that a 5 star hotel restaurant need to charge $2.5 for a glass to tap water.
2. The side salad of the club sandwiches isn’t fresh at all, although the club sandwiches itself is good.
3. Have big flies keep coming to the food."
Dining experience,The service needs to be improved . The chef forgot our order and we had to wait for more than 30 mins till so hungry and after checking with the waiter then was told that the chef had forgotton our order! What kind of service is this?! Not visiting this restaurant anymore
"Excellent food, service and ambience","Excellent breakfast at the Dining Room in terms of food, service and ambience.
There’s an excellent selection of international and local food, vegetarian and non vegetarian menu - There are pastries, salad/ cold cuts, fruits, juice, eggs, international, local sections. International guests can try some of the more exotic fruits found in asia in this buffet. There’s also a coffee area where you can get your espresso in additional to the usual brewed coffee/tea. There’s a wide variety of food, so make sure you come on an empty stomach!
Ambience is nice with high ceiling and if you get a table near the window you can see kois and a lovely fountain.
Service is awesome. Staff always try to clear our plates from the tables promptly even though it’s peak hours. They are always very diligent in ensuring guests have a pleasant meal. We stayed for weeks and never for once did we have any issues with cleanliness or service level. The chefs and the staffs at the eggs station are always so cheerful with a smile. Also remember to try some of the “daily special” omelette.

Special thanks to Pansy who are always so helpful and full of smile and also to Chef Ling, Chef Eric, Chef Aswad, and Daniel and others who planned and prepared all the delicious dishes. Also to all the staff there who are so diligent and friendly.
Highly recommended and will be back"
"Excellent service, amazing ambience and delicious food!","Service staff Tammy was very welcoming, friendly and attentive. We requested for a table near the waterfall which was conducive for a birthday celebration. Food was flavorful - the chicken satay was tender and grilled to perfection, seafood horfun has ""wok hey"" and a substantial amount of prawns and my friends love the cod fish and chips. To end off the meal, we had ice burger and mud pie which was really good. Definitely a great place to catch up with family and friends!"
Comfortable,"It was our Wedding Anniversary, and we booked a lunch on 1 May 2022. It was a pleasant surprise that the restaurant also included a Mother's Day lunch menu. This simplified our decision on what to order. The service was efficient, waiters friendly and the atmosphere, warm. The meal portion was appropriate for seniors like us, instead of a buffet spread."
Good recommendation of wine to go with our foods,Good service and appreciate the arrangement made for a corner cosy table. Friendly service. We will be back for business meeting in future!
Great food and great service too!,Thank you Alyson for your food recommendations and for being so attentive to us. We enjoyed the laksa and mee siam very much and we love the ambience of the restaurant too! Thanks Alyson for your great services too!
"Conducive place, great food served by friendly staffs","The environment is very conducive, especially for business luncheon. Not a wide variety but the semi-buffet was dished up with high standards."
great food - great service,"food was excellent, quality and ambience very nice. portions of the refillable foods were great for sharing between 2 guests. Wonderful service. kudos to the team."
Best Festive buffet,"I would like to comment on the great service and food i had today for the festive season buffet , it was awesome and highly recommended to try the rive scampi superb , done by the friendly chef, gerrard if im not wrong his name , also i would like to applaud all the staff service Michelle , Haziq , Hisyam and tammy for making my dinner enjoyable and amazing , i dont think i need to mention the ambience that the dining hall have. overall highly recommended.. Keep up the goodness , will definitely drop by and recommend to all."
Lunch on Saturday,1. Reservations Process - Very Good 2. Hotel Reminder - Very Good 3. Price - Good 4. Service - Awesome! 5. Food Taste - Very Yummy 6. Food Portion - Very Good 7. Ambience - Awesome
Awesome!,The food was great and the service was awesome. Michael and Michelle were attentive and made good recommendation. No crowd so it was quite peaceful and nice ambience!
Good Food High Price Mediocre Service,"We were at the Dining Room celebrating a birthday.
We were reminded there were no free birthday cake at the time of booking (we were not really looking for a free cake).
We received the menu via email and were quite happy with the local and western selection.
The Local dishes dry laksa (2 prawns and a scallop), beef horfun, sea food fried rice were good but not convinced if the around $30 price tag for each dish was worth it.
The rib-eye (200g) steak medium rare was soggy and mediocre.
The wagyu burger was succulent and delicious.
The 2 plates of pasta we had were fairly ordinary.
The black forest ham and cheese sandwich deserves 5 stars. Was the best dish we ordered.
For dessert, the mud pie is good, however the chocolate crust was too hard to be eaten with the dessert forks provided.

The reason i would pay $30 for a plate of local fare is for elevated service and ambiance.
Both were lacking at the Dining Room. Which is a shame really with the potential the restaurant has.
Table Water is not served unless purchased in bottles ($2.50/bottle). This was the probably my biggest turn-off.
Service staff were not very keen or were not trained in providing service.
There were only 2 other tables occupied while we were there and while we were trying to attract service staff attention, they were preparing for presumably breakfast service for the next day (at 8pm).
We will probably not return unless the service is upgraded and aligned to the quality and price of food.
Management should take notice of the misalignment between anticipated Sheraton quality and the actual delivery."
"Seafood Fiesta Buffet, Semi-Buffet...","Pretty quiet for a Saturday evening, only sides were refillable but overall, we really enjoyed the food! The seafood was very fresh & the sides, although limited, were yummy. We were served by Michelle who was very attentive.
Plain water could have been free though, since desserts are chargeable.
Would go back & relive the experience if they have another offer!"
Great tasting Laksa !,"The Sheraton Towers laksa after 20 years , still taste as good and comes with fresh big prawns and scallops . Good service and quite ambience."
Disappointing Visit to the Dinning Room,"After reading the reviews, I decided to visit the restaurant after a break of 8 years. It was a disappointing visit. Firstly, the restaurant looked dated and old. Secondly, although the food tasted good, the service level was poor. Water was not provided and I had to pay for bottle water. Although the food was supposed to be unlimited portions, the staff missed our order and I had to remind the staff to send our orders. The staff were in a hurry and seemed to anxious to go home instead of serving customers. The price was not worth it for the food and the service."
Hidden Cosy Dining Gem,"Food was good, service was cosy!
My bf and I were celebrating our 2nd anniversary at the Sheraton's The Dining Room restaurant and were pleasantly surprised by the sumptuous food and cosy service, especially by Ms Tammy. She was really warm and helpful and friendly and shared ideas of menu to choose from, and even surprised us with one of the best walnut brownie we have ever tasted!
Highly recommended and Thanks much Ms Tammy!"
Good food & Service,"The ala-carte buffet was worth the money esp the seafood platter. Though the service was a little bit too slow to serve, the staff ensured we were taken care well while waiting for the food and the staff Fancy as been accommodating to our requests. However, do take note that my reservation via chope was not received by the restaurant and we were lucky to get them to accept us in."
Nice Ambience,"Had lunch when having staycation at Sheraton Towers. Ordered grass-feb rib-eye and cod fish & chips, rib eye a bit overcooked but the cod fish was really nice. Good service & atmosphere, overall we're having a pleasant dining experience here :)"
Great Food & Ambience,"Went there with my family for dinner on Deepavali holiday.
The Asian Set menu was great deal @ $48++.
Started off with a lychee spirit to cool down.
Then followed by appetiser with generous portion of shredded chicken pie ti with chili and sweet sauce.
The main course was 7 grain nasi lemak with sambal lobster, crispy boneless chicken, otah and peanuts anchovies.
Refillable side dishes including oyster omelette with belacan dipping sauce, beef rendang, stewed lamb shank, sambal sotong, sambal long beans with tau-kwa and belacan star bean.
Every dish was cooked to perfection. We loved the beef rendang and lamp shank that melts in your mouth.
The oyster omelette is also a highlight, especially when the oyster met the omelette in your mouth and burst upon chewing, then the belacan kicks in, perfect match!
To end it with, the desserts...chedol with coconut ice cream, ondeh ondeh topped with gold flake and durian pie.
The experience was good and we enjoyed the food very much."
Excellent Service and Excellent Food - FlavourofAsian Dinner Buffet,"On 30 Oct 2020, I had booked a table of 2 from Dinning Room and requested for near to Waterfall fountain, even though due to Covid19 on space limitation, the staff still managed to cater to my request and fulfill on it.

As I never believe in Asian Dinner Buffet, but when I tasted the food from Dining Room on the Flavor of Asian Dinner Buffet, it totally change my view. The decoration of the Asian food was so appealing and amazing, just like having fining dining. The food is so amazing and delicious.

Overall I had enjoyed a great service from the staff and Great Asian food for the night. Thank You!"
Bento Set Lunch was Dismal,"We went over to the Dining Room for Bento Set Lunch. The desert was served at the same time as the main meal. Choices for Bento Set were limited. We expected more from a 5-star hotel. For the prices we pay, we would have gotten more value from another 5-star hotel."
A pre-birthday lunch celebration,"I loved the dining place ambience especially the waterfall outside.
It was so sad to the place empty due to Covid-19 and of course with the buffet gone.

Anyhow I enjoyed my Keto bento set very much at a steal price of $38.

Thanks to staff like Michelle Ee and
Philip who gave us their undivided attention!

I will be back to support them!

Esther"
Lunch with family at the Dining Room,"A lovely restaurant with views of two waterfalls in the garden, right outside. Nice ambience and excellent food and service. The satay was fab! My daughters loved the food here. Thanks to Mustaffa, Michael and Michelle for making it a memorable experience for us."
Re-visiting old times,"My husband and I made a return visit to The Dining Room at Sheraton Towers after an absence of more than 10 years. We were pleasantly surprised that service is as good as we remembered. We enjoyed our dinner by the waterfall, to the strains of music from the bar near by.
All in all, a very relaxing evening. Thanks to Aqidah who made our visit a memorable one.
We will be back!"
A wonderful wedding experience with Sheraton Towers Singapore,"My wife and I had our wedding lunch at Sheraton Towers Singapore on 15 March 2020. Overall, we were extremely pleased with our experience during our 1 year of planning, wedding day and staycation at the hotel. We would like to extend our highest compliment to the people and the venue. We truly feel that the hotel deserves more recognition as a provider for wedding services.

The People

First and foremost, we would like to compliment our wedding coordinator, Simin for her hospitality during the meetings and efficiency in replying our emails for the past 1 year. The communication with her was open and clear. We felt very assured to have her as our wedding coordinator.

On the day of wedding, Chao Xian managed the banquet operations together with the assistance of Tommy. We must say that Chao Xian was composed and thoughtful in carrying out his job. He was reassuring and explained to us patiently on what to do before every march-in. He was always in control of the situation and made arrangements to ensure that the unconsumed food was not wasted. We can see that he took enormous pride in performing his job.

During our staycation (15-17 March 2020), we had our breakfast at The Dining Room. While the breakfast selection was reasonably good, we were more pleased with the service staff that served us. They were attentive in their service. It was also a pleasant surprise that Chef Cindy came out of the kitchen to serve us with the delicious scones. It is this little touch that makes our experience special.

The Venue

Prior to the planning of our wedding, we never thought of Sheraton Towers Singapore as a potential wedding venue. However, after visiting the hotel, we were extremely impressed with the Grand Ballroom. The high ceiling and shiny chandeliers of the ballroom were stunning. We also liked the grand staircase leading to the reception area at level 2. And needless to say, the food from Li Bai was superb.

Once again, we would like to thank the hotel for the memorable experience and accommodating to the precautionary measures in view of the COVID-19 situation."
"Good Food, Attentive Staff and Gorgeous Waterfall!","The Dining room has a great ambience, as we sat facing the outdoor waterfall and Koi Pond, while enjoying our scrumptious lunch.

Chef was also able to accomodate special dietary requests like no turmeric and gluten free pasta.

Wait Staff were very attentive and surprised my Mum with a free birthday cake slice complete with a lit candle, when they found out we were celebrating her birthday.

It was also touching when one of the waiters accompanied my Mum out and told us that he was reminded of his late Mother who had recently passed away, and he was glad to see my Mum healthy and about.

Overall, 4 thumbs up! Will definitely come again. Well Done."
Superb !! go for it,"Service, Food, Variety all In. We cant ask for more. Its an international buffet which caters to folks of all ages. Pansy threw in complimentary beverages which makes this an even better deal . kudos"
Wonderful Service,"I'm trying to transition from being a pescatarian to becoming a vegetarian. The Dining Room has adequate plant-based selections for breakfast. Although there's a lot of room for improvement to cater better to vegetarians/vegans, I'm very much pleased that Mr. Derreck exerted extra effort to find food that suits my special diet. :)"
Some nivce Sinngaporeanand malaysain lunch options...!,We came for lunch and enjoyed it. The Asian section was particularly strong in the a la carte section \and Singaporean style crab fried rice truly'hit the spot'. The service was also streamlined but personable.
Excellent service,Mum and I had lunch here and the service was good. The food were excellent. What a good thing in this place is the location which is accessible from MRT and the ambiance of the hotel.
Fantastic food with Great Service,"Good selection of seafood and desserts. The spread isn't as wide as I expected for the mains. Whatever was offered, they did a good job in terms of quality and quantity. Cheese and biscuits were offered too. It was for my birthday celebration and we had a 1-for-1 offer which made it very good value."
Wonderful Breakfast,"Located at Singapore Sheraton Tower, this is Tatler Award winning Restaurant. being seated was fast if before 8am. The breakfast had indian, Chinese, Malaysian, American and Singaporean food. It was healthy, but not in terms of quantity. I mostly enjoyed the vegetable, fruits, congee and noodle. Fried egg and yougurt ice cream and juices. Service was good enough. It has high ceilings with beautuful waterfall."
First and last visiting,"First impression, services was bad from entering into the restaurant till the end of it.
We were served in a unprepared uncleared table, requesting for beverages but service crew ignored our request till we grab hold of another service crew to attend.
Food is barely satisfied, service from the chef was unpleasant when requesting for sauces for turkey.
Looking at the rating given, I am afraid I won’t be returning back."
May be it has the best Dessert in town and staff are friendly & helpful,"May be The Chocolate Mud Pie is the best Dessert in town. Ms Aqidah & MsTammy are hard working, friendly & helpful to us, patiently explained what to expect in their big selection of food menu. Colleagues of theirs are friendly too. The december Xmas decoration of poinsettia in the room is so pretty."
Wonderful Buffer Lunch 🎅🏻🎊👍🏻,Festive lunch buffet today was great! Spread may not be too much but of good quality and sufficient for us. Service was excellent and staffs were nice! Especially Cook Dee serving the roast beef was exceptionally wonderful.
"Beautiful ambience, worth going back every anniversary",My husband and I return to this hotel every year to eat on our wedding anniversary. The food is always fresh and good with the pianist playing music at the background. A wide variety of fusion food ranging from local delights to jap to seafood. Definitely worth the price!
Great Slow Cook Beef,"Not much hotel buffet in Singapore offer this range of food.
Western, Seafood, Singaporean, Japanese and Indian.

And for indian dishes, they are offering few types of curry.
Instead of 1 or 2 in other multicultural buffet
They do put in effort on each type of food they are offering

One of the best slow cook beef I tried in buffets.

Highly recommended :D"
Food ok but poor service,"The food was ok. Little variety but ok.

However, the service was terrible.
1. They refused to celebrate my birthday because they said that my mum informed last minute. We always do it last minute, but there was no issue.

2. They took so long to serve the tea, and keep saying ""later on"".

3. The manager smiled. But her smile just didnt felt genuine."
Women only WOW dinner,"This happens every Wednesday, and a reservation is required. It starts at 7 pm. It is a buffet in which women get a 50% discount. Some of the food items are: king crab, small lobster, crab, prawns, mussels, clams, scallops, some local delicacies, fresh fruit, ice cream with various toppings available such as jelly bellies, marshmallows, pecans, walnuts, and Seven up, and Pepsi soft drinks. It is quite a nice spread of food.
I was very impressed with Tammy the supervisor running around like a track star."
Unpleasent Experience,"This used to be one of our favourite spots for buffet. It serves great food and wonderful ambience. We make reservation to have the window seat and took a day’s off to enjoy the lunch buffet.
When we arrived there, the place was like a market place filled with people and a long queue to enter the restaurant. When it reached our turn finally, the waitress showed us to our table. To our horrid, it was not the window seat which I reserved and worst of all it was in the middle of the walking corridor beside the buffet table with many people walking past our seat. Our window seat was given to some other people who arrived before us. We had called to reserve the window seat in advance but apparently they did not reserved the table for us.
We decided not to eat the buffet and to leave the place. We actually waste a day's leave specially for the lunch buffet..
It was utterly disappointing. I would think twice about going to this place again.
They should have told me that the place is very crowded and reserved for seminar when I called to make reservation. Customer service is really very bad."
Excellent Dinner,"Had a fabulous dinner here with friends and throughly enjoyed the whole experience. We both had opted for both Ala Carte and Buffet to experience the menu. Dinner buffet was excellent and my friend order a Nasi Goreng. The Nasi Goreng was amazing and so delicious. The dinner buffet was of good selection and offered freshly shucked oysters, sashimi and a good variety of International cuisine. I also want to thank our servers who took great care of my friends and I. Tammy and Mustapha in particular were fantastic and so was Chef Koon Wei was making my special dessert. Overall, it was a good meal and would recommend the place for sure!"
Lunch with friends,We had 14 of us and reservation were made a week ahead. All seniors were excited to dine at the Dining Room. Service was very good. Staff was very prompt to replace empty plates and replenish items on the low side. Plus the food spread was good. The seafood was particularly fresh. Roasted lamb very yummy with red wine sauce. We had 2 seniors who is having their birthdays and they were blessed with each a durian cake. Fresh and awesome. We particularly enjoyed the DBS 1 for 1 promo. Thks to our local banks having such promo.
Wonderful ambience and service,Good discount for WOW especially guy with gals. Mainly seafood and pastries are wonderfully made. Should have more oysters to serve.
Best Afternoon Tea in Singapore 🇸🇬,Prompt email reply for reservation. Best afternoon tea in Singapore with splendid ambience and friendly staff. Definitely will try to go every week! 😍😋
Lunch @ Sheraton Towers The Dining Room,The Dining Room is an excellent place to celebrate birthdays. We have received good service from the reservation right up to the celebration itself. The buffet spread is really good with international and local dishes. Even my son who is celebrating his birthday enjoys his slice of cake with dedication. The staff are cordial and professional and they even offer us coffee after the meal. Many thanks for Helen B. and the rest of the staff.
Dinner Buffet @ The Dining Room,"The Dining Room at Sheraton Towers was consistent with the numerous food reviews online - a buffet with a small but quality selection of food. Seafood lovers would be pleased to find usual favorites such as salmon/tuna sashimi, fresh oysters, king crab legs, scallops and other delicious seafood.

In addition, the ambience of the place was amazing. We had a window seat by the waterfall and dined with a live pianist playing great music in the backdrop.

Best of all, couldn't be more pleased with the service from The Dining Room. We would like to thank Helen from The Dining Room who helped arrange for a cake as a birthday surprise for my fiancee. After making a phone call to request for a cake, Helen was conscientious and followed up with me to arrange an opportune time to bring out the cake during the dinner to surprise my fiancee! Thank you Helen and staff of The Dining Room for making our dining experience such a great one!"
LUNCH BUFFET @ SHERATON,"Had Lunch buffet with Colleagues at The Dining Room 2 @ Sheraton Towers on wednesday 10 July 2019. It was really a nice environment and the servicing staffs May & Tammy were extremely efficient, helpful & kind. Thanks to Chef Eric & Chef Aswad, food was really delicious. All the dishes were done perfectly with a touch of
home-cooked style.

Definitely, I will highly recommend for good quality food, nice ambience & excellent service.

Thanks to all the staffs & management of Sheraton Towers Singapore."
Late Night Hunger!!,"Looking for a late dinner place and whole family is really hungry!

Sheraton Towers is probably one of the only few that opens till very late.

We had some pasta, soup and salad.

Why a 4/5 rating?
Food took a little long to be served.
One of the order was slightly wrong.
Dessert was forgotten to be served.

But we were still pleased as the server was very friendly and apologized for the mistake."
Lunch buffet at The Dining Room Sheraton Towers,"Had buffet lunch with family at The Dining Room, Sheraton Towers Singapore on Friday 21 June 2019. It was a really nice environment and the serving staff were all extremely efficient and helpful. Chef Michael Tang even offered to whip up a plate of fried rice for my teenage nephew who is munching away on keropok! He was so delighted & sang praises of the delicious treat! We were all impressed with the attentiveness & friendly services offered by all the staff at The Dining Room.

The spread is not too big but all dishes were done perfectly with a touch of home-cooked style. The desserts were especially worth all the calories! They were all freshly hand-made in the hotel and rest assured they went easy on sugar so it was reassuring to indulge.

Definitely highly recommended!"
Quality food and service,"The food was of quality, not variety. Some food run out before we could try them. The place is not noisy and has nice ambience."
Good service,The waitress Ms Tammy is very helpful to serving the tea to us . She always puts on a smile on her face which is very professional .
A wallet friendly feast that tops with a friendlier service!,"A credit card promotion drew a few of us to celebrate a special occasion for a friend at the Dining Room today. We were delighted by not only the best service in town, but also an excellent spread of buffet foods. We were charmed by the hospitality extended by chef Michael Tang, he went around to introduce his foods through serving his customers. He was friendly and chatty.

The waiters and waitresses were great as well. It also worths mentioning of Ms Wai Fong who went an extra mile to serve us the best brewed coffee. She repeatedly brought out desserts freshly come out from the kitchen.

I enjoyed the freshness of salmon sashimi, it is simply yummy. The local fare was equally delightful to my stomach. Laksa and Indian mutton topped it all.

We didn't have to break the bank to enjoy this feast. It was a super delightful experience at the Dining Room!"
Mother’s birthday,Excellent service and great variety of food. Never failed to impressed me. My family love coming to the dining room. Five star for Chef Eric Cheam and his team.
Buffet Lunch @ The Dining,"Absolutely please with the service by Chef Eric, Michael Tang and the servers. Buffet lunch is value for money. The servers were extremely friendly and attentive. Good Job!"
Great food with amazing service!,"Had a birthday celebration for our friend at this lovely place today! Enjoyed the food alot - spread isn’t overwhelming, allowing us to savour each dish and go for seconds for our favourites ;) Good quality, seafood is fresh and my friend especially love the snow crab! And most importantly, the people working there are courteous and attentive. Ms Helen Banes was helping us with our birthday cake surprise and her passion for what she’s doing really shines through. The night was made special also because of the laughter she brought to us :) Here’s a huge thank you to all of you at The Dining Room!

(Not one to add pictures to reviews usually, but here’s one for Ms Helen Banes! Thank you for the cake!)"
Buffet Spread - limited,"Thanks to Helen Banes for great customer service. I was not impressed with the Buffet spread. It was extremely limited. Besides sashimi, there's no other fish dish. The Hokkien mee was already soggy. The pepper crab was tasteless."
Lunch Buffet,"The lunch international buffet was slightly limited in variation, but the food was still of a luxury hotel quality. My family and I especially enjoyed the laksa cooked by Chef Michael Tang, and would consider that the highlight of our lunch! The staff are really prompt and friendly, theie service is really good and the ambience is perfect for dining quietly. Would really recommend for a peaceful dining session!"
"Amazing view, crew and (fon)due 😊","Location : Right beside Newton MRT. Very convenient and accessible.

Price : S$52++ for lunch, certain cards have 15% discount

Food : Not the widest range of food but I would say it is good enough. The seafood selections were very fresh, light and sweet. There were cheeses to try and I actually liked the cheese at the soba station best but at the cheese station, the smoked cheese is recommended to try. I felt that some of the food were a little too sweet/salty/lacked in something but overall the quality was still there. The dessert bar had a good variety and balance. Loved the unique lemongrass icecream, the purple looking kueh(no idea what's the name), cheese cake, panna cotta, hazelnut chocolate Btw, the roast beef tasted amazing and then I ate it again with the mustard sauce the chef brought to us, it was even more amazing. It was a daily special I think(?) But yes it was good.
Overall : 8/10

Service :
So I reserved lunch(12noon) for 5 at 11am and they did not have seats at the window. I was quite sad because the view was so uncommon to find in Singapore. But the man helped us checked and found that they had a seat available loved that a little extra effort made by him!
Chef Michael Tang was super friendly and gave really nice recommendations for the buffet line. He brought the roasted beef nicely plated all the way to us I was just curious so I asked if the restaurant has anything special arranged for a birthday occasion and he asked who's birthday it was. We(my sister and I) had to reveal it was ours and he scurried away to inform his colleagues. He came to our table with a whole chocolate cake and lighted candles (not from the buffet) and we took photos together too
There was this lady waitress that was super nice too, she had the nicest smile but I don't know her name :(

Overall service :
100/10 (I'm sorry but they exceeded my expectations)

The whole place was not crowded at all even though it was a Saturday afternoon. I'm not sure why but it might be the publicity of the place. I don't hear much about the place and only one or two websites had useful information about them. Glad I decided to give the place a try. I will definitely visit this place again one day. Thank you for the great birthday lunch

Side note : the fondue in the title was just for the rhyme I sadly did not try the fondue. I can write more but this will it's too lengthy
Find me on instagram @jy_jiayi"
A very nice and attentive service staff,"Buffet is not our favorite, we visited because complimentary vouchers were given by our son. Similar to any hotel's coffee house or restaurant which serve buffet, the food is not of high quality. The Dining Room is not an exception. What impressed us the most was the serving staff by the name of Tammy, she was attentive and very helpful. When we requested for warm water, she did not just pour the warm water directly onto the glasses which were already on the table, but served with cups with handle and saucers for safety and convenience. When a long queue formed at oysters counter, she voluntarily asked the chef to give us 5 pieces of oysters without queuing, because of our old age. She also made good advice and recommendation for food and dessert which we deeply appreciated."
dinner,had their buffet dinner. service and food quality are decent and the view in the background is great.
Anniversary Dinner,"My family were celebrating our anniversary , were impressed with the all-rounded , attentive , service with a smile staffs at your Dining Room . My wife was especially happy with your staffs : mainly manager Kenny, Mathew, Chona, Helen Banes, Mustafa & Letchu . Your crab promotions was indeed a good item. Definitely will be back again ."
Average spread of buffet varieties,"The staffs are all very friendly and nice. At first we were very happy with the selection of food. However, after a while we realised the varieties was not too many. Buffet started at 7pm and by 8pm, oysters were all gone. The manager said that the oysters was out of stock already. How can that be when you said that this is a buffet Dinner? There were only 2 types of sashimi, tuna and salmon which were so commonly found. However, they have more selection of desserts but i am not a really sweet tooth person. Ice cream selection only 2 types. Sweet drink either Pepsi or 7 up. Something I like only is the salad selection. Quite alot of vegetables to chose. Their snowleg crab is also tasty.
The hot food area I don't find it tasty. Overall disappointed at the price to pay for this buffet."
Great buffet spread and service!,"Great buffet spread with wide selection and food quality was good. We particularly enjoyed the prime rib from the live station. Snowcrab legs and seafood were very fresh and tasty. Service staff was attentive and friendly. We want to specially thanked Kenny, Helen Banes and Chona for the thoughtful and personalized service. We indeed had a great dining experience. Keep up the good job!"
an amazing place with exemplary services,"Great food and amazing service wrapped up together in this beautiful yet nature kind of manmade waterfall restaurant. A pleasure to experience this 5 star hotel DINING ROOM restaurant with amazing staffs that always pick a conversation with us to make us feel more comfortable with the ambience and the food as well. Helen Banes was always there for us to fill in our needs like accommodating us specially because many of us were there. She makes sure that everything works perfectly for us. Mr Kenny, thank u for taking time to accommodate our quantity and keeping us intact in one place as this is our only way to gather during Chinese New Year’s eve 4/12/2019. Kudos to the two of u and to the indian girl staff (sorry i overlook the name) who was always with us too during our dinner. Kudos to that great service. Definitely will come back soon and bring my guests over."
Sheraton Towers,"Good variety of main courses with reliable daily starters of sushi, sashimi, soup and salads and daily desserts of fresh fruit, cakes and icecreams."
Prelude CNY buffet,"Chef Michael Tang was on the floor (wow!). He was there to tell us a little more about the servings, which is refreshing. The spread was wide and the offerings sumptuous. I am happy that the Dining Room (as always) had everything well spaced and of course, the Sheraton waterfall is an iconic addition to any meal. For the price that you pay for a buffet, it's worth every dollar in terms of food, service and ambiance."
Nice environment,A bit disappointed there were no oysters. Rest of the food was reasonable. Roast section only had lamb. Drinks were also limited with only black tea or coffee. Other kinds like cuppucino and chamomile tea have to top up. A bit empty and quiet so very conducive for chit chat. We had a nice quiet table next to the water fall.
Excellent experience by Chef Eric Chiam & Helen,visited this place for a cozy buffet gathering with my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday and the ambience and service was awesome! Food was very fresh and service staffs were very attentive and thoughtful to lookout for me (8 months preggy here) and Chef Eric were constantly checking and ensuring that buffet were constantly replenished for the diners and quality are in place. will definitely recommend this place for dinner dates or catching up with friends!
A place with nice ambience,"A great place for gathering, catching up with friends and family members over food in a cozy ambience. The restaurant has a pleasant surrounding with greenery & a waterfall. Loved the oyster and the black sesame fried rice is unique."
Excellent Chef and hospitality ;),"I had breakfast at the Dining Room during my Christmas staycation. The service was great, especially Chef Michael Tang who made me and my friend felt really welcome! Chef Michael Tang was in-charge it the popular egg station and he prepared excellent variety of eggs and a specialty local dish - Mee Siam! Amazing experience and I’ll be back soon!"
excellent food and service for dining at Dinning Room in Sheraton Towers Singapore,"We had enjoyed ourselves during our Christmas family dinner at Dinning Room in Sheraton Towers Singapore on 22 Dec 18 for 24 pax. This is our 4th time dinning in this restaurant due to the excellent food and service standard in this restaurant.

There are many tasty dishes served during our dinner buffer there. The durian cramble desert is well received by the diners and there is no end in helping ourselves with this desert. There are also many variety of cakes and types of deserts to fill our appetite. In addition, there are many variety of main dishes including seafood such as crabs, clay fish, oyster, japanese sushi and soba noodles, etc. the french onion soup, honey chicken, ham and laksa are very delicious and we really love the food there. We later understand the dishes are cooked by Executive Chef Aswad Othman. Kudos and thanks to Aswad Othman that we have a delicious and enjoyable dinner that night.

The services provided by the service crew is also excellent and gets the thumbs up. we had an exclusion area for our family dining which gives us more privacy. The waiters and waitresses are also polite and helpful in many ways."
company lunch,"Food is fresh and good.
Ambience is good and comfortable.
10 of us sitting around long tables, those seated at centre need to take some effort to push chairs in and out when going for buffet food.
It will be good if the spaces between tables are not too close so that we won’t hit each other if we move out at the same time.
Coffee is only brewed black type and tea only one type. There will be additional charges if we go for latte, cappuccino.
Service staff seems lacking when ordering coffee / tea as when we approach a service staff, reply was she is not in charge and we need to go for the right person.
We waited for quite along looking here and there and finally someone attend to us but very reluctantly / unhappily taking our orders. She must be overworked or being assigned for not her task.
It is good that the coffee is good quality and well brewed to our taste which makes our company lunch end well."
At the dining room,"I was not happy with the customer service as they charged me $62++ instead of $52++ per person. When I realised it, it’s already too late as I had reached home. Anyway, overall is food is nice and the environment is great."

"Lovely spread, good ambience","It has been a while since we have been to Sheraton Towers Singapore, hence we decided to have lunch at The Dining Room 2 weeks ago.

The experience has always been pleasant and it was exceptionally awesome that day! I was walking past the dessert counter and commented to my friend that tiramisu was not available in the selection that day.

Later while we were halfway through our meal, the staff presented us with two slices of tiramisu as their executive chef, Mr Eric Cheam overheard our conversation.

We were thrilled with the exceptional customer service and that Chef Eric paid great attentive details to their customers.

Thank you so much for making our day and putting a smile on our faces too! We would also like to thank Tammy for checking if we would like to change to another table in the event that it was too hot in the afternoon. Lovely service!

This restaurant has a good promo for Wednesday where ladies get to dine with 50% off for dinner."
Great ambience and service,"Great ambience for a buffet dinner, quiet environment with only the piano playing at the connecting lounge which was separated by a row of fresh flowers.

Food-wise, cold seafood was fresh, with the fresh oysters rinsed in ice cold water. There were 4-5 types of crackers available, complete with 3 choices of chilli dips. Salmon sashimi was good, sushi although limited in variety, satisfied the kids. Hot items were generally good, with innovative dishes like black sesame rice. A few meat stews that looked really good. Thumbs up for the french onion soup. Desserts section looked compact but it has a little of everything. Lemongrass ginger ice cream sounds interesting, which i forgot to try after trying the durian crumble! The chocolates looked exquisite, there were marshmallows & gummies for the kids!

Service was impeccable, staffs were really attentive and friendly, always with a smile. Thanks to Chef Eric and his team, we had a truly enjoyable dinner!"
Waterfall and ice burger,"I was having assigment project for my study, in food and beverages management . My friends who have an idea to write about the dinning room. We divided to have lunch and coffee break to survey the foods and try it . The moment I enter the restaurant I saw beautiful view is the waterfall in the corner and sounds made everyone’s relax."
