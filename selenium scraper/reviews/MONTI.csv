Rude manager,The vibe is nice but the manager named Angello is really rude to the Asian customers. The food is so-so better at somewhere else
Birthday dining@Monti,"Wonderful environment, world class staff, excellent food, reasonable price. My wife and I enjoyed ourselves and the staff also helped to take pictures to help us remember the evening."
Monti christmas brunch,"As a whole my first dining experience at Monti was out of this world. For this visit I dined with my family and as a collective we felt what stood out was the food offered for the occasion.

For the items offered at the live stations, I tried all 3 items: the roasted lamb, cheese wheel truffle risotto and last but not least the salmon coulibac. All 3 items were prepared with very fresh, high quality ingredients and were piping hot when I received my portions.

As for the items on the menu. I tried most of the mains and all of the deserts. The quality again was outstanding. What stood out to me was how in all of the dishes I tried, all of them were very very well balanced. The acidity, sweetness/saltiness and other elements were just right and it was very clear to me that a lot of thought and care was put into developing these dishes.

As a whole I highly recommend Monti as I am a diner that rarely frequents Italian restaurants, the food here is fantastic and I would definitely return here for special occasions."
Monti Christmas Italian Brunch by the Bay,"I was invited by a very close friend to attend the Monti Christmas Brunch by the Bay with my family

It's was our 1st time dinning at the restaurant, we were very impressed by the service standards the staff provided and of course not forgetting the delicious dishes the chef created.

We will definitely go back to Monti again."
XMAS Brunch 25th Dec 2022,The roast lamb was anazing with the roasted garlic and brussel sprouts. Overall experience throughout the Brunch i cluding service is worth a revisit. Good job👍Matthew and his team.
Business Dinner,Very bad service; food has deteriorated significantly; waiting time was too slow; super expensive; place is not well kept; bottom line - we were all very disappointed
Wedding at monti,Great place to have wedding though it's quite expensive at $250 per pax 🤣 recommended place and food is good
The Best Italian restaurant,"Iconic spot for a wonderful night. The atmosphere and view is amazing. Six stars for the food and service! the pasta and steak was top notch, one of the best that we ever had. Highly recommended!!! Special thanks to Chef Felix and his A team, we really enjoyed the night. One of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. Definitely one of our fav restaurants."
"Amazing food, ambience service and view",Sighted this interesting looking restaurant while visiting the Merlion Park and decided to walk in to see if a table was available even though we didn't have any reservations. We were informed that the restaurant was full for the night but when I mentioned I wanted to celebrate my wife's birthday over dinner the lady at the concierge was extremely helpful and somehow arranged a table with an outdoor view for us. The service was great and the food was top quality and as expected from a fine dining restaurant. Overall it was an extremely good experience and would definitely recommend this place to people looking for a good overall experience of fine Italian cuisine.
Gamey Steak,"This was more a 3.5 / 5 thumb experience. It’s been awhile since I last came here. The reception was excellent and service ok. Ambience was cosy and respectable. Food presentation was good but I felt the steak although cooked well was “gamely” in taste. Having said that I am not sure if it’s the source issue as strangely I have experienced this at a few other well established restaurants serving Australian wagyu and other steaks (dare I say I will be avoiding Australian steaks for a while).

All in an ok experience with a nice view of the Marina Bay."
Below average service,"Nice food and amazing view but below average service. We arrived on time for our reservation, but no one’s at the door to welcome us, we tried to look around and no one’s paying attention. So we had to wait. We finally got our table, gave us the menu & just left us. They served some starter sauce but there’s no bread. Took them awhile to serve just the bread. We told one of their staff our friend has nut allergies and he said he’s gonna check with their chef. Took him 25 mins to come back to us so we could finally order. Its a mission to get anyone’s attention. Then dessert time, they served our friend the dessert with lots of nuts when we told them she has serious nuts allergies."
Good food and Great views!,I had dinner at Monti’s solo and the views were amazing!!! The food was good. I had the lamb chops and the seafood soup. Service was good as well.
"Great restaurant, great view, nice food and good service!","It was our first time at this restaurant and we had a memorable wedding anniversary celebration.

The service from the front desk and service staff were prompt and polite. We had a table by the windows with amazing view of Marina Bay.

We tried the weekend brunch buffet and all the food were amazing perhaps with the exception of the barramundi which my wife feels have a slightly 'fishy' taste.

Overall, we had a great time, enjoyed the food and ambience as well as the excellent service from the staff. Highly recommended!"
Check bill as they overcharge!,"The food and service was reasonable. But after I left, I noticed they had overcharged me. I contacted the restaurant several times but they did not reply or follow up.
I do not normally write reviews, but overcharging is very serious and I am disappointed and amazed they did not treat this seriously. It says a lot about them. I would avoid the restaurant or at least look very carefully at the bill!"
Nice restaurant,This restaurant has an amazing view over the marina and is lovely at night. We could only be seated outside on the deck which was ok. The prices are quite expensive. I had the lobster and prawn mezzelune ravioli which was a bit over powered with tomato. The service was first class. Not my favourite in Singapore but still worthwhile. Would I go back? Probably not as there are so many lovely restaurants in Singapore to try.
Afternoon tea,It was great enjoyment to have afternoon tea with my girlfriend amidst the scenic views and great ambience. The service staff were quite attentive and approachable.
Great Food with Personalized Service !,"We went for the Weekend Colapranzo Brunch and it was absolutely outstanding. The food as always was superb, perhaps the best calamari we have had, some beautiful pastas and absolutely wonderful and tender meat options.
But most importantly, service which really defines the restaurant sometimes even beyond the food, was impeccable. Our special thanks to George, Honey and Lulu for taking care of us and our guests and creating a truly memorable occasion.
We definitely look forward to be back here."
Afternoon tea with great views,"We visited Monti for the first time and enjoyed the excellent service, afternoon tea and bay views. The staff (such as Mr Haiqal Rashid, Ms Nur Syahirah and Mr Matthew Leesbourne) and their team made it a nice experience for us, from the reservations stage to the actual afternoon tea. And they arranged a nice surprise for my friend as part of our celebrations. Thank you, Monti!"
A wonderful night,"We had dinner at Monti Fullerton Pavilion on August 5th. I'm really grateful to Matthew and his team for the well-prepared surprise. They were really attentive and gave me advice before my proposal. I believe everyone who has proposed knows how nervous and exciting it is. With their help, my proposal was successful, my girlfriend is now my fiancée

Thank you for going the extra mile! We had a wonderful and unforgettable night!

Kudos to all of you!"
Good experience for birthday celebration,Excellent view and good sized servings for starters and entrée. Friendly staff who were attentive to our needs - special shoutout to Seraj and Monica. Also given a special small chocolate birthday cake for my birthday. Would go back there again.
Amazing lunch,"My wife and I went for a lunch and it was delicious. They have a set menu for lunch that has amazing options of appetizers, mains and deserts 😋 our options in the pictures 😉"
4 Hands Experience,Had an amazing experience trying the dishes crafted by Chef Felix and Chef Edwin!! The finesse required to bring their ideas to reality was exceptional and needless to say the food absolutely amazed me. Super looking forward to the next 4 Hands experience
Ridiculous service,"Our table waiter was very rude, ruined my beautiful evening with my beloved family.
He all of a sudden did not answer or respond to any of our questions during the conversation while he was making some recommendations for the menu, and left. After a while, he came back and pretended that nothing happened. He did not ask us about how we would like our steak done, did not offer any spoons at risotto, and all his gestures and facial expressions were so rude and I felt offended. I am very disappointed at this ridiculous serving in a Michelin star restaurant.
서빙히 형편 없었음. 매우 무례 했음. 괜찮은 파인다이닝을 기대하고 방문했으나 매우 실망했으며 해당 웨이터는 매우 무례하여 우리의 저녁을 망쳤음."
Decent restaurant in marina bay,"Great restaurant wonderfully located by the marina bay. Great view of MBS is guaranteed. Nonetheless, a little disappointed with the food quality."
Magnificent bay view,It’s a charming restaurant that’s literally in a globe building in the Bay. Beautiful view esp at nights with all the twinkling lights. Delicious meal esp the risotto in lobster bisque with crispy fried lobster pieces.
"So much potential, but disappointing","We booked way in advance as it seemed to be very booked up. The restaurant changed the time of my booking by one hour without informing me (not a big deal, but a bit rude). When I tried to alter the number of diners several weeks out, I couldn't do it online and had to call. Called multiple times in the day, evening and at night over several different days. Emailed, no reply. Numbers changed again so I emailed again, still no reply. Had no idea if they knew how many were coming but when two of my party fell ill on the day and couldn't come, I emailed again (no reply) and tried to phone multiple times (no answer). When we turned up they were expecting our original booking, so no one is checking emails even though it's the only form of communication. Views are beautiful, looking straight over the bay, with all the boats going past and the light show at MBS happening - unique place with loads of potential. Drinks are nice but they have the old wine list on the QR code menu (so easy to update, come on!) so most of the wines we asked for, they didn't have. They didn't have pizza, despite that being half their menu (see photos) and the only mains. Burrata is served with no dressing and no bread/crackers etc. The fried caprese (the only veggie option) was pretty awful, oily and cheap ingredients. Music was turned up to overly loud (couldn't hear the other person I was with) and we left to find somewhere else for a final glass of wine. Such a shame as it could and should be fantastic but it was pretty disappointing. I probably wouldn't go back.

Pros:
Beautiful view and lovely unique setting

Cons:
Communication
Food options
Wine options
Music"
My family and I were well taken care of…,"At this price point, I didn’t expect anything less.

From the pasta to the desserts, a minor flaw in the mains which we put down to a bad evening, our meal at Monti was a lovely respite we needed for the weekend,

Kids and wife were swooning at the views and well, I had a very contented belly of food.

The service was warm and friendly, made us feel at home and you could see the effort put in to ensure a seamless experience.

We’d certainly return…. when we feel extra generous again with ourselves."
Cancelled Hightea,"I had booked a hightea for 16 Apr 2022 to celebrate in advance my birthday with my friends. To my surprised the staffs told us that the hightea is cancelled bec unfortunately 5 pastry chef got covid.
Luckily Haiqal and Syahirah was on duty during that day. They were able to make a last minute arrangement to Atico for the same price. And Syahirah also made sure to try to accomodate my request for window table. The situation could have been a disaster and big disappointment if its not handle properly. But I am very greatful to Syahirah and Haiqal they did not let me down and ensure that I enjoy my bday celebration. Their prompt arrangent and customer service were absolutely excellent. We also enjoy the hightea at Atico.

And Im looking forward for my next week booking at Monti."
They cancelled our reservation before the day even arrived!,"I went initially a couple of years ago. However, I had a big party planned and wanted to take a few friends here, made a booking prior about a week before and all got very excited. Then the DAY BEFORE, I received a WhatsApp telling me they had canceled our reservation. Made up some feeble excuse. Not happy at all, and expected better from such a 'highly respected and influential restaurant."
Absolutely amazing!,"the food and experience is really great. We tried the 6 course meal and everything is so special. we would like to commend Darvin, he is really very friendly, he even ask the chef to remove truffle because I don't like it. He always attend to our needs. We are also in a nice view of the MBS. Thank you, Monti!"
A very disappointing meal,"I have planned my anniversary celebration today since last month and i’m very disappointed. I came in and took my seat, My partner called for your waiter/waitress countless times, and 3 of your service personnel told us to wait. I waited for over 30 minutes and still i couldnt get anyone to place my orders. Thus, i left. I dont think this is the standard you should treat your customers. Furthermore, i would like to emphasize that my partner has tried to call your service personnel countless times, and only 3 times did we get an answer, to be pushed away to wait. For a whole 30 minutes. Thanks, and we wont be visiting again."
Spectacular view!,"Went to Monti rooftop bar in the evening. The night view of MBS is spectacular, the best around marina bay. The drink and food are good too. Highly recommend!"
Awesome View & Delish Mains,"Greeted by friendly and warm service staff. We had early lunch and hence was nice to be allocated window seating with nice view. Food was good with the most outstanding being the mains. Had house-made pasta and beef short ribs which were both delish.

Would recommend early lunch to enjoy a quieter ambience. Restaurant started filling up about noon time on a Friday and it became slightly noisy."
Great view good food,The view is excellent and ambience is great. Seating comes with either high chair or normal table seating. Service is generally good. Food and wine are good too. Better truffle fries than P.S. cafe ha. I prefer the pizzas than the pasta. The vegetarian brinjal dish surprisingly exceeded my expectations. Definitely will be back.
Wife Birthday Dinner,"Good food and wonderful service at Monti. We had beef tartare, egg plant parmagiana, lobster ravioli, prime ribeye and tiramisu and they were really good! Mr Selvan was very friendly and regularly checked on us to see if we needed anything.

We will go back again for the nice view, food and service!"
Birthday dinner,"I was slightly late so I called in to the restaurant and they gladly held the table for me. When I arrived I was warmly welcomed by Rebacca, who showed me my table. She was very professional and friendly at the same time! The whole dining experience was very good and the food was amazing. When I was almost done with my dinner, Rosa suggested I go up for drinks and enjoy the view. Did not regret! My experience at Monti was rly 5/5 thanks to Rebacca and Rosa!! Hope to see them and the rest of the team the next time I come back :)"
Wonderful celebration of my daughter's 21st Birthday!,"My family had a wonderful celebration in Monti tonight!! Mr Selvan's service is way beyond expectations!! His recommendations were very good!! The food was excellent and the service and the ambience made the whole celebration such a memorable one!

From the point I made a reservation, Monti's service is tip top. I received msgs to confirm my booking and the team gave me great advice about the difference between rooftop booking vs indoor booking. They also helped to accommodate my change in timing. We had a wonderful table overlooking the MBS! I was even able to deliver my daughter's birthday cake directly to Monti. They even checked with me if the cake was to be served after my meal. So much details were put into my booking!

We were so pampered and it has been a long time since we had such excellent service from a restaurant!"
Delivery of Christmas Bundle - Poor communication,"Delivery on Christmas Day was so late and there was no communication from the restaurant. I had to communicate with Oddle Logistics. I understand that due to overwhelming number of orders, there will be delays but this was a 4 hour delay with no apologies. It was lucky that I needed the meal for dinner and not for lunch.

Food quantities were meant for 4 persons but the quantity of each dish was so small except for the ribs."
Fantastic dinner,"Had a fantastic dinner here. Hari, Gandhi and Sean made our experience here most enjoyable! Their recommendations were good and the dishes were delicious. Thank you so much :)"
Christmas Eve birthday dinner,Iveta served us for this occasion. She is a wonderful and lovely server who is very accommodating to requests and paid attention to even the smallest details. Full marks to her and her service! Cheers !
Excellent experience,"Love the food, the view and the service. Had a great time with my friends and after service, they even sent a personal email link for reservation. Thanks team !"
Excellent service,"No other word to describe but EXCELLENT!
We had lunch to celebrate Christmas in advance. However Rosa was friendly and welcomed us with opened arms.

The entire staff were really pleasant and knowledgeable. They kept checking on us on the food and if we were comfortable.

Food was AMAZING!! We had the best sitting view.

Definitely a place to come back to.

Well done Monti!

Sincerely,
Fran"
The BEST Chef n excellent service ! MUST COME !,"A very interactive and fun chef . The team are very observances and friendly! Celebrated my birthday tgt with my friend there , we had so much fun ! The food was 10 out of 10 for me ! Please try the signature from their head chef Felix Chong ! Oh yeah the roof top bar is very good to take photo too ! Feel free to ask the staff take photo for you they’re very pro with that ! I’ll definitely go back again n bring more friend !"
EXCELLENCE!,"No other word to describe but EXCELLENT!
We had dinner to celebrate my friend's birthday. It was raining heavily and traffic was crazy, hence I was later for my reservation which was at the rooftop. However the ladies at the reception were really nice to get me a table indoors, and Rosa welcomed me with opened arms.

The entire staff were really pleasant and knowledgeable, kept checking on us on the food and if we're comfortable.

Food was amazing, and on top of the the breath taking view.

Definitely a place to come back to.

Well done Monti!"
An overall wonderful dining experience!,"We had the degustation 6 course menu and it did not disappoint at all. Our favorite dish was the 2nd course scallop and the 6th course Australian wagyu beef. Selvan's recommendation when it comes to the wine was on point. Monti is the perfect place to bring your partner for a romantic and quiet dinner and the view was beautiful too. Our second time dining here and judging from the experience, there will be a third time."
Dinner with a View,Had an amazing experience at Monti. We were served by Iveta and our dinner was made more enjoyable with her service. We will definitely come back for the beautiful view and food! Thank you :)
"Thank you rosa for an amazing experience, always.","I have been super impressed with monti’s excellent service over the years.
Thanks a million to Rosa for being super efficient and patient with me. She sends me the menus of the restaurant, & if im fickle abt it she offers me a list of restaurants that she has helped booked on behalf of me. Im grateful that you save alot of my time! & for that every occasion i have at monti i look forward to meeting her in person .

I have dinner at monti yearly. & its always amazing!I had a lovely table and a lovely dinner served by shawn/shaun and Dharveen. They were super friendly and professional. The ambience was great. Great for couples/family dinners !

My friends and i ordered the mayura and we never regretted it. The beef was amazing! Cant wait to try it again.there was a display before they served the dish(insta worthy much)"
High Tea,Nice dining experience with great view good place to meet up and dine in definitely will go back again
Great place,"Amazing view and look like restaurant floating in water and very nice service.
Truffle risotto was very nice and everything was reasonable.
Mr.Federico explain about food with focus and friendly. Nice to meet him and Thanks made my girlfriend special birthday.
We will visit again and we hope get back service from Mr.Federico"
Beautiful lunch!,"To be honest, it was a last minute decision to lunch at Monti.. But it was one that impressed us and we had no regrets!
Food was great and we totally enjoyed our wedding anniversary lunch! Iveta took great care of us and was extremely attentive.
We had a beautiful view of the bay and MBS. While it's not very sunny, it's a little glaring for us. We will definitely come back for dinner some day or ask to be seated at the higher deck for less glare and more comfortable temperature ."
Excellent in every way!,We enjoyed every moment of our dining experience tremendously from the moment we were taken to our seats which offered an awesome view of the Bay. Staff provide personal attention and efforts were made to make the evening a memorable one in every possible way. Food is outstanding. Left us looking forward to our next visit soonest! ❤️❤️❤️
"Great ambience, nice view with delicious food","We were served by Vhora Neta the moment we sat down. Neta is very patient and clearly explained the soup of the day and offered her help when she saw us having problem deciding on the menu. Came by periodically to check on us. A place for various occasions, business talk, birthday celebration and many more to list."
MONTI,"Great food and drinks. Fantastic ambience and a beautiful location, both indoor and outdoor.

But what absolutely stands out is a very friendly and welcoming staff. Federico had great recommendations.

Special shout out for Rosa, relationship manager for MONTI. Helpful, resourceful and on top of her job.

Definitely going back."
Good food and fantastic service from Iveta,"I was at Monti recently celebrating my wife's birthday, the place is located at Singapore's Marina Bay. You can't miss the building cos it's as unique as the MBS hotel across the bay.
They serve great authentic Italian food and they were fantastic.
The best experience besides the food was undoubtedly the service that we encountered.

Our server has the best attitude, friendly and a great smile.
She made sure that everything was ok and if we had any additional requests, she would promptly ensure that they were taken care of.
A big appreciative thanks to Iveta, you have made our day with your great service.
We will definitely be back soon."
Lunch Meeting,"Ambience was great. Service was awesome. Food was nice. Some dishes were too pretty to touch & eat. Overall, they are happy to be here. Thank you!"
Relaxing Afternoon Tea!,Ambience was good for bonding with family and friends. We were served by the manager who would come by the table to look into our needs.
Fantastic service from Mic,Went on a Wednesday in a group of 3. Great service from Mic who ensured we had a fantastic night out and was extremely friendly and accomodating! Pizza was the highlight food wise as well!
Monti (Fullerton Pavilion),"Went as a couple on our anniversary, had a wonderful experience. Food was good and timely served. Kudos to Evita, the lovely lady who attended to us. From the seating to the serving of wine, she was most accommodating and friendly. My wife and I enjoyed the food and the terrific ambience (you will soak in the views across the bank)."
Dinner at Monti - Manager was a superstar,"First time in Monti for dinner and we were not disappointed. The ambiance of the restaurant is amazing likewise the food, especially the service of the Manager Federico (Italian gentleman). He is not only excellent in customer service also his knowledge and care to his guests was TOP caliber. He even recommended us to enjoy the desserts at the roof top. The view was really nice. Food was divine, especially the pasta and sharing beef.

For sure we will come back because of Federico’s service."
Dismal service. Mediocre food.,"Dismal service!!! Had dinner at the rooftop section on 25-Nov. I had to order a cocktail twice form the bartender and it took 45 min to be served. In the meantime, the bartender was offering free shots to his friends at the next table. Asked for more condiments twice during the 3 hour meal and it never came."
Service was just plain atrocious,"This very detailed feedback shares the atrocious experience we had with Monti on 23 Nov 2021, 7:45pm. Honestly, the service level we have received from such 'award-winning' establishment has left us speechless. It was a unique experience that i never have experienced at other restaurants/bar with similar accolades.

In my reservation note and during the phone call with their staff, i have clearly conveyed that i will there for ONLY drinks in their indoor area and will order food from their a la-carte menu if i require.

When we were there and the manager got to know that we were not having dinner and we already had one elsewhere, he was clearly unhappy with the idea. His demeanour further expressed his displeasure as he kept away the dining plates and utensils with unpleasant 'clutter and noises'. During the process, he sweeped my mother's phone from the table to the floor and that has caused a crack to the screen. Granted, that is a mistake - but it is a mistake that has happened due to inadequate service and attitude. My judgement was affirmed to be true when he approached us and conveyed that we are required to have increase the spending (more than just drinks) should we want to keep the table longer. This was when we told him about the cracked screen.

This could all be avoided should they have clearly conveyed/stated the minimum spending requirement on the reservation portal or during the phone call for RSVP. We would have established our plans as per dining duration/spending requirements and very well be able to comprehend should Monti require certain turnover to sustain the balance sheet. Even if this was conveyed while we were there in proper, we could have.. exit or spend additional(?)

I believe that i can fairly conclude that 1-Group/Monti has failed to train her staff to treat customers with respect and dignity when customers do not hit the 'minimum spending' they desire.

The manager did apologize after and offered to better our experience for the night, but put yourself in our shoes - will you be able to stomach the food/drinks.

In fact, i do frequent 1-Group's F&B portfolio (in fact a loyal supporter) for their good service, drinks and food. With the very unpleasant service i have received that left us in great disappointment and rather perplexed as to how to respond to the situation, i highly doubt i can say that i will be glad to support, moreover recommend them in near future.

And yes, we were compensated for the cost to replace the screen. Now, we are left to bear with the inconvenience which we should not in the first place be required to go through."
Wonderful service,"If you’re someone who appreciates good service, this is the place to be. Was served by Hadi and Suraj during our visit, and can I just say that their service was 11/10! When we were seated, Suraj checked on our dietary restrictions and ensured that they are well informed of it, and what to avoid on the menu due to the restriction. Hadi gave us some recommendations, took the initiative to serve the soup in 2 separate bowls instead of us sharing 1 big bowl. Throughout the night both of them checked if everything was going well, made small talks with us. Both of them were very welcoming, friendly and thoughtful- cherry on top of the dining experience.

A place to consider if you’re celebrating birthday/ anniversary or anything, really. The ambiance was great, especially being able to have music played in the background once again.

The view is nice- but of course it’s blocked by pillars all around if you’re dining inside the restaurant. Food was above average. Overall a good experience, would recommend to dine in for special occasion.

I personally think that even if the night (Food + blocked view) was average, the service really made a difference to the whole experience."
Impressive beyond initial expectations. Thank you for such a pleasant evening!,"I haven't been back to Monti since the last restaurant week in 2020, and hesitated as the previous service was passable.
This round, spontaneously decided to pop in as we were strolling the area and the view was amazing. Sauntered in and was warmly greeted by the maitre'd , seated next to the windows overlooking the Bay.

We were attended to by the manager Federico mainly and by a junior staff Vishal, all of whom seem to have really good connection and chemistry for the flow of service.
My husband and I always appreciate a fine touch of service, and trust us when we say we encounter one. Federico and team have delivered quite impressively, with the flair and personal touch that goes beyond just the machinery and protocols. We had a very good interaction with him and the team and so it seemed with the other tables. The whole package really stood above when the manager to the hostess, and the service crew are all dressed well, neat and good sense of personal hygiene.

Food-wise, we particularly loved the way the pasta was presented in the giant parmigiano wheel. What a treat to watch and taste something so fresh! Drinks was something that's always high on our agenda. I heard they do some really good c-tails but we decided on a very decent bottle of champagne, thanks to the recommendation of Federico. The night ended off very very pleasantly and beyond my initial expectations. Thank you Monti and team for the experience! We'll be back!"
Compliment to them,"Superb good service
Thank you Nency good customer service officer at front desk
Thank for receiving the cake for me from courier guy

Thank you Evita, Hadi and Ivet
Great service officer for serving us
Good foods good photos
And the birthday surprise

Well done. Lastly all the employee and manager here !"
Excellent food and service,"The service is unmatched. The staff truly cares about your experience. The food is absolutely amazing. Highly recommend! Special thanks to Joshua Sim for the hospitality you showed during my visit. I want you to know how much I appreciate the excellent service you provided on Saturday when I took my date for dinner. Your attention to detail, great communication skills, and ready smile made the experience even better than I expected - P.S. His signature Rosemary spritz is to die for!"
Fantastic service with amazing food,"Nice ambience. Food was just amazing. My wife who has more or less abstain from meat was enjoying the meat so much. Service is top notch. The staff really know the menu and recommended well. They also kept things reasonable, suggesting against ordering too much when we highlighted that we are not big eaters and still plan to have a desert. If there is anything, I would say the desert while good, is nothing out of the ordinary."
Excellent service n excellent food,"The food was excellent. Beautiful view of MBS n blue waters
Service was amazing!
The restaurant manager Mr Federico Burci even deshelled my prawns for me !
The other staff were very good too namely Anthony.
I also received an email from the restaurant after my meal :

And to make sure you will be extremely well looked after, please use this dedicated reservation page: Gillian's Reservation Link.
We can’t wait to see you again.

Rosa Krishna Heng, Guest Relations Manager

I'll definitely return to dine at Monti soon❤"
Interesting experience.,"Went with my mother recently to celebrate her birthday as she's never tried Italian cuisine. Probably the day we went was a busy day as the service all around was scattered, they seemed to be under-staffed as it took a while for the water to be served and such initially. But our server Hadi was an absolute delight, explaining all the food choices patiently and even recommended some great options to my mother. The scallops and goncchi were amazing, deceptively small portions but super filling. Risotto was prepared at our table and once again our server Hadi did well to tell us a story while preparing. Blessed we had such a nice person attending to us and the cherry on top was the complimentary birthday dessert that made my mom's night. Will try to visit again on a weekday, hopefully it won't be too packed."
An awesome high tea delight!,An awesome experience right from stepping into the restaurant to the impeccable service of the restaurant manager Rosa to be ushered to a perfect view of the MBS and the palatable high tea menu to complete my day! The high tea was commendable for the choices - variety and simply Italian. Will definitely return for more glorious food and service.
epic business lunch and fantastic service with stunning views,epic business lunch and fantastic service with stunning views what more could you ask for? great place to network and take clients
Gorgeous value high tea,"Great selection of 4 savoury and 4 sweet canapes for $38++. My faves were the wagyu beef and pork bolognese with crostini, fried caprese with salsa verde and limoncello custard cannoli. The tea selection could be wider, perhaps add-on premium options, and though we didn't add on the glass of wine/champagne, it was nice to know we could've made it a merrier occasion. The November 1-for-1 deal high tea made this a steal! Great service as usual!"
Great food with great view!,Food quality was excellent! great ambience and view. staffs were very nice and service was excellent. Will definitely comeback for a good celebration dinner
Lovely views,"We went to the rooftop area for drinks and snacks. The views of MBS across are lovely, especially in the evenings. Snacks are limited."
Perfect dinner at the Rooftop Bar.,"Surrounded by nice views. Every food item we ordered was good. Attentive, friendly & excellent service. Nice that we didn't feel pressured at all to return the table by a certain time which is the practice at some places now. Before I left the place, I was already planning my next visit in my mind & made my next reservation when I was home."
Wonderful experience,"Try to sit at the rooftop area if possible as the view is extraordinary. It may get a bit warm though depending on the weather conditions. The indoor seating might have great view too but the rooftop is really a great place to chill.
Service is not bad. Their iberico pork is really so delicious! It's actually one of the best pork I have eaten so far. The potato gnocchi on the other hand is just average. Gets really sick of it after a few mouth.
Tried their signature cocktails - Mr Monti. It's average I feel, nothing fantastic.
They have really good tiramisu too - Must try.

Overall really love their pork and the view!
The price is on the high side. Pretty much everything on the menu average around minimum $30+"
Wonderful birthday celebration,"Bought my wife to Monti to celebrate her birthday and it was a good experience!
The service was prompt, we had a good window seat where we can see MBS clearly.
Food was great, the risotto served at table side an interesting experience and clearly, the food was delicious. We also had the wagyu steak for two to share and it was grilled to near perfection.
Overall, a great experience and surely to return in future."
Virgin Monti experience,"First time at Monti & was greeted warmly by Ms Rosa! She was very accommodating! Couldn’t decide what to get so I went with the chef’s 6-course & it was amazing! On my way out, Ms Rebecca graciously helped my gf and I snap tons of photos. Good food coupled with great front of house service!"
Great View and atmosphere,Had dinner and wine at the roof top bar. Had excellent service from Glen and amazing service from Vishal. Good food and good NZ wine. Great evening for our wedding anniversary.
Wonderful Dining Experience,"Kudos must be given to the service staff,especially Federico and Anthony. They truly and greatly contributed to the wonderful overall dining experience. Of course, the food was also excellent. We were simply delighted by the whole experience. Please keep up the good work!"
Initial reception was cold but the waiting staff warmed it up to a happy ending.,"This is my 5th visit to Monti, and as usual the food is excellent and the ambience remarkable. However our enthusiasm upon arrival was dampened when we asked the lady at the entrance if the restaurant managed to reserve a table by the window for us. The reply was a mechanical ""On weekends, window seats are by availability only"". We then clarified that we mentioned this in our reservation so we wanted to know if we have secured a window seat, and she repeated the same reply, with no acknowledgement of receiving our request. While we understood the policy but her lack of acknowledgement indicated she did not know which table is exactly ours (so is our table by the window or not?) and made us feel that we can ""take it or leave it"". We felt a little bruised.
We sat down, made ourselves comfortable and got started with the ordering.
All the food were lovely and the serving of Prosecco generous.
However, my friend was not entirely happy with the Sirloin steak and gave her feedback to Mr. Hadi, who had been diligently serving our table. Mr. Hadi acknowledged it readily and within a couple of minutes, the Manager-Mr. Federico was at our table to ask if he could understand a little more of our feedback.
We are both heartened by Mr. Federico's sincerity and professionalism. He explained to us how the steak was prepared, so we could understand why it looked different from what we expected. He then asked for more feedback of what customers might like to see on the menu, and also offered not to charge the additional $12 for the Sirloin (it was a fixed price Ala carte buffet brunch). Both Federico and Mr. Hadi then continued to offered their kind attention and graceful gestures which made us feel special.
Mr. Hadi was sincere and attentive at all times, which make us grateful.
By the end of our lunch, we felt happy and were sure that we will return again.
Our compliments to Mr. Hadi and Mr. Federico for their efforts in making sure their customers feel welcome and comfortable. Keep up the good work!

Grazie Mille! We will be back soon!"
Excellent experience,"We hv had a wonderful dining experience last evening. The ambience & view are awesome & we thoroughly enjoyed the savoury dinner! To top it off, both Darveen & Anthony & all the other unsung heroes took care of us superbly well!"

Pleasantly surprised - GRAZIE,"Excellent food, great service and a really nice atmosphere with stunning views of MBS. Special thanks to the manager Federico for his special touch. Torneremo di nuovo!"
Amazing experience,"The staff were all extremely eager to please, food standard was excellent too. Price was pretty reasonable for what you're getting too, definately recommend window seating or outdoor seating for best views in the house. Was here for my wife's birthday and got a cake too!"
Perfect date night!,"We chose Monti to celebrate our 13th yr wedding anniversary and are glad we did so. The food, their staff, and ambiance were amazing. We especially loved the Risotto and the preparation process, it was a great experience! We'd also like to commend Hadi, the ""Master of Risotto"" for being attentive and excellent customer service. We'd definitely come back even without the occassion. Keep it up!"
A romantic night out beside the bay,"My partner and I celebrated a special occasion at Monti. Everything about that night was not only magical but curated by an amazing team. Thanks to Massimo, Chef Felix, Alessandro, Rosa, Nency & the team.

We ordered from the chef’s degustation menu, 6 course. The food was astonishing, from the fresh flavours to the presentation.

Let’s not forget about the view. Not only was the food aesthetics on point but the killer view just made the whole night complete!

I would like to personally thank Selvan, Hadi and Dharveen for the personalised service!

I would definitely recommend Monti for a romantic dinner date"
Thank you for the wonderful experience,"10 Sep 21 was my wife and my first visit to Monti. The excellent view and great food were dwarfed by the top-of-the-world service, especially by Dharveen and Selvan !!! Kudos to you and I hope your management acknowledges your effort in providing the super friendly and professional service provided. My wife had a very happy birthday celebration because of you guys. Thank you very much, your good service will be the reason for our next visit. Hope to see you then, Dharveen and Selvan ! - From Thomas"
Indeed the best italian restaurant in Singapore,"Chose Monti to celebrate my mom's 60th birthday and best decision i made. We got the lunch set meals and a btl of red wine to share. Food is of high standards and my parents loved the beef w foie gras, dish perfectly done, one of the best beef they ate in Singapore. Thank you for the world class service from all staff especially Director that checked on us if the food was good and even followed us to the rooftop to help us take photos. Thank you for making the birthday lunch so special and memorable for my mom. Thank you for the complimentary birthday cake as well. Highly recommend, the best place for important celebrations!"
Great food and ambience. Excellent service,"Had dinner with my partner and we had such a good time. Vinoth, our host for the evening, was very friendly, pleasant, and went out of his way to make our dining experience special. Excellent food, beyond excellent service!"
Going away for friends,"With such a sad night of saying goodbye to close friends on their way to another chapter, we had a difficult time trying to get reservations anywhere around Marina Bay Sands area. Thankfully the Beautiful Ms. Rosa came to our rescue!! We were able to get a last minute rooftop table for five that allowed us to laugh and remember the times we have had together. Ms. Rosa was amazing, constantly checking on us and making sure our experience was the best it could be as one of our final nights hanging out with such a spectacular skyline behind us and the bay in front of us. Thank you so much, Rosa, we cannot express our thanks enough!!! You definitely know how to make the dining experience as best it can be!!!"
A place not to be missed for a memorable dining experience.,"Had a amazing dining experience at Monti, Rooftop bar. Was there to celebrate a friend's birthday. The food and wine were excellent and at reasonable price which I did not expect for for such place. Superb ambience. But what was most commendable was their service from two of the staff, name M/s Venot and Vishl (hope I get their name right). They were very pleasant and engaging. All the time ensuring that everything is well. What impresses me further is the immediate follow up after my visit. Keep it up all of you!!! I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in making my visit to Monti very memorable. I will definitely come back."
Definitely worth going!,"My husband and I had such an amazing time at Monti! Gorgeous view, loved the atmosphere, and the staff was so accommodating! Highly recommended!

Chef’s creation is out of this world."
An Italian Singapore ‘experience’ like no other..,"Service from staff & personal touch from head chef Felix second to none.
Our guests were in awe & the food/experience second to none! We will always be back…
Thank you again, Lorraine"
Good service,My wife and i had dinner over at Monti last night. We wanted the outdoor seat and was offered the very corner seat by the counter lady (didnt get her name) which we really appreciated and then the bartender Vinoth came to approach us to get our order and also again offered the outdoor seat which was in the middle (as the other) customers have finished their dinner so that we can get a better view of MBS. He even gave suggestions on the food and drinks we gladly appreciate and had small conversations with us which made us feel very welcomed. Very good service Vinoth! keep it up!
Great CS 👌🏼,"My friend and i got a seat outside with an amazing view, Amirul and Darveen were super helpful and friendly while helping us choose drinks. Very attentive customer service from both of them. Will be back soon!"
Excellent food and service!,"I went there for a.birthday celebration, and we had chosen a seat at the outdoor.

welcome by Chef Felix and his team with a glass of bubbles. We had the 6 course Chef's Degustation, and it was really good. The flow to each dish was smooth. Lesh was at our service that night, and he definitely know his stuff well to explain each dishes to us, and being very attentive as well.

Definitely a place i will recommend and go again. Gonna try their ala carte next time, heard there was se truffle dish that is very popular!"
First time at Monti but it will definitely won’t be the last !,"Brought my wife to have her birthday dinner, and was recommended to try this place. We ordered Iberico pork and lobster prawn ravioli, we are small eaters so we didn’t go for the 6 course meal. We were amazed by the prompt service, delectable food, amazing view and great service from Vinod, thanks for his great service and friendly chat, we had a more relaxed and enjoyable experience in a fine dining restaurant. Definitely will need to be back for the course meal !"
"Amazing food, service and view","My wife and I celebrated our 21st anniversary dinner here and we had an amazing evening. Not only was the food delicious, the service was warm and attentive while not intrusive. In particular, one of the managers, Sheraj, was a wonderful host. Definitely bringing the rest of the clan for a meal here soon!"
Superb service,I am very impressed with the service I got over the dinner! All the staff are awesome especially the two manager tat service us:) the food is superb!
