Consistency,"You always know what you are going to get at Din Tai Fung, no matter where you are. I have come back to Singapore after a few years away and was greeted by my usual favourites - Steamed Shrimp & Pork Shoa-Mai, Steamed Pork Xiao Long Bao and a Lemongrass Juice. Slight menu change since pre-COVID. Missing the Kung Pow Chicken and the Lychee Mint drink. Fast service and friendly staff."
Dumplings,A perfect restaurant for eating dumplings. All different locations serve the same perfect food. I suggest to view the video of eating tis special type of dumplings
Always great,"Having not been in 12 months it was great to see the standard has not dropped.

Fresh food made with quality ingredients at a reasonable price.

You can't go wrong.

I got it via foodpanda and even though delivered via push bike the food was still hot and delicious."
terrible,never ever have stock for this even if u were the first few customer. went to quite a few outlet and its always the same. Din Tai Feng sux totally.
Never Disappoints,"Din Tai Fung is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. No matter which branch you go to, both the service and food is always top notch. I haven't tasted any Xiao Long Bao that tastes better than the ones at Din Tai Fung.

This place is a must try if you're a tourist."
Fantastic dumplings and fried rice,I love the Xiao long baos here. They are amazing with vinegar and ginger. The egg fried rice with pork chop was really nice too
This is the worst ding tai fung experience i had,"Generally people would associate ding tai fung with impeccable service and consistent food. While is food is still good, I was really disappointed with the service. I went for dinner on a Saturday evening and they were very busy. We waited for 30 mins before securing a table and it was challenging to get the attention of the waiters to get a water refill. And the worst part is, one of the item we ordered, prawn and egg fried rice took 40 minutes to arrive. Usually ding tai fung waiters would check on our orders without being prompted when it doesnâ€™t come within 10-20 mins but in this case, we had to ask a waiter to do so, and when he came back, he just put on a poker face and told us to wait for another 6 mins, not apologetic whatsoever. This I find, is rather unacceptable by Singapore standard
The only plus point was, thereâ€™s an appetizer, çƒ¤éº¸, which was available in Singapore while it was taken off the menu in the malaysia outlets. The pork chop is also better than Malaysiaâ€™s"
Excellent,"For local dishes, well cooked and presented, value for money - it has it all. No international food here, just local dishes which are freankly delicious. Bargain prices, quick service, and it you drink the tea, that is supplied in unlimited quantity - ie free refills. Very little English spoken, but with prictures and goodwill all will go well. Well worth it for you 1st local dishes, or worth a re-visit to enjoy yourself twice"
"Excellent flavors, friendly service","We dropped in for a late lunch in November. The lunch time crunch was past, and the staff had wasted no time in cleaning the place in preparation for dinner service. Nevertheless, we and other customers were welcomed with a warmth that was genuine and were assisted in our selections by a friendly and good humored waiter.

We tried both pork and vegetable filled dumplings as well as what we knew as baby bok choi. We also tried steamed buns filled with bean paste. The dumplings were generously filled and fried to perfection. I could have eaten them for hours! The bok choi was tender, flavorful, and supported by an array of excellent vinegar, fish sauce, or soy for dipping. Finally, the steamed buns were some of the best we have eaten (this after 30 years of travel to China!).

I warmly recommend this restaurant for lunch or dim sum."
Love it so much that I had to come back :),"A friend recommended me this place. It's a chain restaurant but I checked the one in Central (not far away from Merlion park). Anyway, I love it. It's all about dumplinks. They are perfect and you have a huge selection so better order more but smaller portions. Anyway, we like it so much that we come back there. The other time we ordered Fried Pork and Fried Rice plus dumplinks (of course!). Everything was delicious!"
Dumplings <3,"I tried quite a few items from Din Tai Fungâ€™s menu and everything was equally good. They are famous for their dumplings and for all the right reasons, but the Sichuan sliced beef and buns were amazing, too."
"Excellent food, interesting experience","The fact that you can watch your food being prepared by a busy, hard working set of people behind the glass and steam is just so much fun! You can choose from a huge variety of dim sum as well as fried rice and other options.
We had to wait a little bit for our food as we did not have a reservation or signal our orders in advance. We stumbled upon this place when we came into the Marina Bay Link Mall to cool down (while we were doing the promenade). We didn't know this was a well renowned food chain! A must try. Deliciously fresh!"
Great!!,"We went there as many people recommended us to go, and we really liked the food!! Reservations canâ€™t be made, and we had been told that there were always many people waiting... but when we arrived they gave us a table quickly! We really enjoyed the food and the price was ok taking in account the prices in the country! Will we repeat? Sure!!"
The wait was worth it,"A busy place with large crowds waiting to get in even though we had a reservation and came early. It was worth it. Fried Rice with shrimp and egg, oriental salad, stir fried Hing Kong Kaila and a plum drink was worth the wait. A meal I will never forget."
ENROLL AND WAIT FOR YOUR TURN TO TABLE,"It was a pre-planned dinner on 20th July night. We were 6 persons and had to wait for more than 40 minutes to get a table. The ambiance is good, service is good and among the food items, we liked the Egg Fried Rice the most."
Dumplings!,"Singapore probably has the most number of branches outside china. Always popular, though some may say the quality differs from taiwan. And the service is local"
Good Choice - Tasty!,We got some food to take back to the hotel from here and it was very tasty! The dumplings are pretty epic as are the noodles! Definitely recommended - the menu is huge!
Delicious dumplingsðŸ¥ŸðŸ¥Ÿ,"We enjoyed the food so much here that we forgot to take photos of the soup and steamed buns.

The dumplings arrive piping hot, straight from the stove top. The rice with shrimp and egg was delicious, a must try!

The staff are amazingly efficient and you can watch the dumplings being made before you enter.

Thoroughly enjoyable experience!!"
Value for Money,"The place is part of a chain of high end Chinese eateries but a bit small.
Anyway size does not always matter. Variety of dishes, quality, ambience and courteous service bear the Hallmark of Din Tai Fung brand.
Whenever I am in Singapore, having a meal with them is part of my routine. I love it."
A good diner,The location of the restaurant is underground in a mall. Inside the restaurant it's quite noisy because of the density of customers. About the food it was excellent . Dumples were very tasty. Taiwanese beer was better then tiger beer. Finally a very good diner with colleagues
Very nice Dumplings,"Conveniently located close to MRT made for a great dinner before heading to Marina Bay for the night. We went for an early dinner and were seated and served right away but if you are going later you may want a reservation. We also noticed they have takeaway service. We had the stuffed chiliâ€™s which were very nice but not spicy at all so donâ€™t fear their appearance. The fried dumplings with veg were nice and had a taste of maybe spinach inside. The spinach and garlic was a huge portion and nice refresher amongst all the heavy food. The only â€˜surpriseâ€™ were in the chicken and vegetable dumplings there is quite a bit of coriander/cilantro which I thought was delicious but my husband hates so I was stuck trying to finish them all. Also, order the ice tea! It was absolutely perfect down to the ice tea ice cube to prevent it being watered down. Great touch. Highly recommend!"
What a delightful surprise!,"We were at the Raffles Bar (as an aside, donâ€™t bother) and the bartender gave us a recommendation for dinner across the street at the mall. We made our way to Din Tai Fung. What a great place! The menu is in English so it was easy for us to order. We had a selection of their famous pork dumplings, shared some soup and tried various delicacies. Everything was tasty, arrived timely, and was piping hot. What a wonderful Singaporean experience! Highly recommend!"
Absolutely the best dumpling place,"I would go here for lunch every day of my life if it weren't for the queues. I absolutely love the xiao long bao here - so juicy, the skin is so thin and the liquid is both light and flavorful. The other dishes are great too - I particularly love the egg fried rice and the oriental salad.

If you haven't gone to DTF yet, go now!"
Pretty good food with lackluster menu and atmosphere,"Food was well executed, but menu and atmosphere are both lackluster. We got a variety of baos, dumplings, sides, and appetizers, as well as free-flowing tea. Everything comes out freshly steamed. The service was fine, but it was difficult to order more things. It seemed like once you ordered the first round of food, they were hoping you would be done. The few things that we ordered were the best looking on the menu. Everything else was less appealing. Just like the atmosphere of the restaurant. It reminded me of an iHOP or a mediocre diner. I would assume there are better places to get buns and dumplings in Singapore."
good,"I came this branch in my last trip and this time I come back. Good service, not wait to much. Food is good. Nice."
Best buy in Marina Bay complex,This place on the lower level is a hidden gem amongst all the touristy overpriced eateries here. The dumplings are awesome especially the soup dimplings ( Xiao Lon Bao) I can eat a stack of these. I also suggest the Dan Dan Noodles which are exquisitely spicy Szechuan style. Overall its all very good whatever you order. Its a bit of a chaotic place. You will end up waiting most times for a table. Give your name as soon as you get there. Then they give you an order sheet. You need to order before you get seated. Donâ€™t worry. Itâ€™s well worth the slight inconvenience......
"Good food, can improve service","You exactly know what you can eat, so, not exceeding expectation or in satisfaction with the menu.

I was alone so I appreciated the quickness: 5 minutes after my order I had everything on the table.

Ate very well.

Not speaking English personnel, I had problems understanding the ingredients of food. Garlic, onion, etc.

I will come back because food was really good."
Go for the truffle & pork dumpling!,I am a dumpling lover so had to try this place. The steamed truffle & pork dumpling alone would make me go back again and again.
Good food and good prices,You cannot go wrong dining here with the famous siao long pow and my fav the pork cutlet fried rice. The home made chilli here is a winner
My favorite place for dumplings in Singapore!,"I can eat their dumplings every day, love them! You can even watch how they are prepared, very impressive.
I had all of their dumplings, the only ones I don't like that much are the chicken ones as they have coriander inside. You have to try the oriental wantons, they are delicious!
Either go before 11:30 or after 13:30 as it is fully packed over lunch time."
Great restaurant,Great location. Superfast service. We were there at lunch time and the place was packed and buzzing. They brought out our food really fast. Top notch food as always.
Good dim sum!,"This is a no frills, very efficient place for a tasty dim sum. All of our dishes were flavorsome and decent portions. Would definitely go back."
Dim Sum to shout about,"This is a chain with a universal menu. I say this because sometimes that means average and underwhelming.

But the quality is superb. There are several of these in Singapore and I have been to a few. This was my first visit and here and I was not disappointed.

If you like Dim Sum head to this restaurant and head there soon."
Best Dim Sum ever!,At at this restaurant twice - in different locations. You can watch chefs make the dim sum. Best fresh dim sum we have ever eaten!
Yum,"Quick and attentive service. Amazing dim sum. Both had noodle soup i enjoyed mine by husband said the beef noodle soup, beef really fatty meat. Only let down. The bill was cheap too. Overall brilliant"
Great dumplings even better steam buns,"The food we had was great, the selection of dumplings were very good but it was the steam buns that were amazing. Long wait to be seated as the restaurant is very popular."
Donâ€™t miss this place.,"You may need to wait in line but itâ€™s worth it. A great dumpling place , fast service and very low prices for Singapore. I tried the chicken dumplings and they were amazing , juice, hit of the steamer and tasting good. There are other items on the menus but I doubt Iâ€™ll ever try them.

Highly recommended !!!!"
Amazing quality of food!,"We were hosted at this restaurant by some of our friends living in Singapore. The quality of the food was amazing and the service good. Ordered Pork which came off so easily. The wanton soups, the kailan, and the dumplings were simply delicious."
Great food; great franchise,"In this restaurant you are seated and given a paper menu whereby you would select your order manually. They give you a large picture menu and the offering is varied. The hostess would circle and confirm your selection. She then takes it to the cashier where she enters your order and then comes back with the bill. You leave the paper order on the table and then comes people dressed in white garb sporting a white oral mask who delivers your order as it becomes available from the Kitchen. They crosses out the item they deliver. For the most part the items come closely together, but the dumplings took a little longer. Once they are delivered though, they are hot and so great to eat immediately. The only downside to this franchise restaurant is they charge 30 cents for 8 oz water, but we were not charge for hot tea and they refill the hot tea. Service is not Western where the hostess/server would chit chat. No chit chat in this restaurant, just good meal served promptly and efficiently."
Same quality every time,Service is prompt and food good every time. Pork chop on fried rice is a must try. Of course the xiao long pau in any form is good here with the chilli sauce by the side
Dumplings and more!,"We dined here on the recommendation of friends. This place is busy, so either get there early or be prepared for a wait. The system for queuing is based on the size of your group, not first come, first served. So patience is required... While waiting, you are given a menu/order page, to select your meals. And you can watch the items being freshly prepared.

Once inside, the meal order is collected and straight into it. We did experience some delays with items all coming out at different times - we expected this given this is the way food is served in Singapore, but items such as rice which are an accompaniment, you kind of want to eat with other items, not last. When the food did come, it was fresh and tasty. As soon as we were finished, the table was cleaned and we were all but kicked out! Next waiting please!!

There are a number of these restaurants in Singapore, and we recommend visiting at least one on your travels."
Culinary Efficiency,"We went to this restaurant after being told about it. Apparently it's highly rated in Singapore and was awarded Michelin star! First impression- it's huge, maybe 70-80 tables! Crowded even on a weekday. As you enter, they give you a paper with something like MCQs (In an exam!). You tick off the dishes you want and move to your table. After a short while they they start delivering dim sums in wooden containers. This place is famous for dim sums. Along with that we had Chinese fried rice & noodles. All very well made & tasty. Fast, efficient service as well."
Lunchtime,"We visited for lunch. Very busy and a long wait. Luckily one member had eaten here before and able to organise us by ordering and booking a table.
Well worth the wait- tasty dumplings, spring rolls, rice and wantons all quickly disappeared. Unlimited jasmine tea appears by magic."
Incredibly tasty,"Iâ€™ve entered the restaurant casually expecting nothing special and it really surprised us, we had a dumplings based lunch with a local salad, buns and jasmine tea. The food was amazing, tasty and genuine, I especially appreciated the spinach in the vegetarian dumplings, they had a nice Mediterranean flavour and it made me feel home a bit. Definitely recommended."
Never disappoints,This chain of Din Tai Fung has succeeded in provided the same level of satisfaction of dining no matter which resturant you attend. The only issue is the wait: every outlet has a line some longer than others. But trust me itâ€™s worth the wait
Classy Dimsum,"The place is clean and the servers are very attentive. The food is fresh and very tasty. Loved the various selections from seafood, chicken and beef. The food is made right in front of you for everyone to see. They donâ€™t go around in carts. Your menu items are served/delivered by various servers. Reservations recommended especially on nights and weekends."
Assured quality,"I've tried the original in Taipei, and this one in Singapore. Both were good, but this one is in a mall, so the atmosphere is completely different. The food was as nice though."
Heaven on your plate!,"DTF is THE best place to get dumplings! Their juicy pork dumplings are a must. Highly recommend the pork chop fried rice and the hot sour soup. The wontons in oriental sauce is a delight, so is the chilli stuffed with meat.
This place is perfect for lunch on a rainy day!"
Poor management of restaurant,"With more than 1/2 the tables empty with unclear plates, many customers have to wait 20 minutes before getting a table to sit down.

This was what I experienced tonight at 6:05pm. Looking at the restaurant, only 2 waitress or servers plus the manager were at work. Basically a situation where there is insufficient workers on the ground. After about 10-15 mins, another staff came on and started to clean up the tables so that customers can sit down.

I visit this outlet quite often and this is the usual scenario I witness on most time.

Hence my advice is go to other outlets which I feel have better service and speed."
High quality but limited menu,"We ate here around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. No wait for a table and it is mercifully in an air conditioned underground passage. Everything we ordered was great (chili crab bao, truffle pork dumplings, shrimp shu mai and noodles with sour cabbage) but I thought the menu was somewhat limited and not as expansive as some other dim sum restaurants."
Good meal,"Was a bit hesitant to go to Din Tai fund being vegetarian, however ended up there as we didn't have another restaurant option after a long day. We enjoyed the veg dim sums, the noodles and the greens. Vegetarian options were limited, but good. Nothing tastes as good as their chili sauce mixed with the soy, guess thats Taiwanese speciality. Oh not to forget, expect a 30 min waiting minimum."
Taiwanese food in Singapore,"Very popular .Took as much as 40 minutes to get a seating for the family ! Very clean ,good ambience ! One can get the menu while waiting and decide what you want have for your meal . Service was quick and efficient. One has to have a taste for Taiwanese food to appreciate the food here ."
Mmmmmm.....,"We love to come to Din Tai Fung. A great place to take people to enjoy the freshest dumplings, and some with a little twist. It is fun to see the dumplings being prepared through the glass as you wait for your table. It is a delight when you sit down and they arrive all steaming and so yummy.

Worth a visit if you enjoy a good fresh Chinese experience"
Lunch,Food Is always consistently good like the rest of the outlets. Long queue and need to wait for a long time.
Quick snack,Dropped in while shopping for a quick snack. Excellent Dim Sum as ever. The pork & truffle Dim Sum was great.
Awesome,Absolutely amazing dim sum. The flavours were delicious. Service good and reasonably fast. Not that cheap but well worth it. Recommended.
Dumplings here are unbeatable,"Tried this branch after one in Taiwan. Let there be no confusion. DTF dim sum / dumplings are unbeatable. The specials are nice, however the classics are the one you go here for! Super soft and warm dumpling with very flavorful explosions on the inside. Must eat really."
Nice place for Weekend lunch,Nice place for Weekend lunch. Not crowded. About 80% filled. Food quality is great and service is great.
Good for casual meal,"This outlet is comparatively empty during dinner time. Normal standard as other din tai feng. Xiao long bao, fried rice and sour spicy soup recommended."
Satisfying good and quick meals,"The oriental salad has increased its prices to $5. 160grams said the staff. It is still good but pricing is getting a little high now. The Zha Jiang Mien has always been good but at $10.50, still it is a little pricey considering all the ingredients were beancurd, a few broad beans and minced meat sauce. The Kailans are $13.50. Way too pricey. Again, who would come here to eat vegetables. Overall, I have to say, food is tasty, but given its prices, we have no lack of Imperial Treasure to Crystal Jade to feast our bellies on Xiao Long Baos."
Worth it,Would say this is the best Din Tai Fung in Singapore. Food is great! If you go at night there is a bit of a wait but it is worth it. Pricing is a little more expensive but given the location it is expected.
Excellent Experience,Our first visit and once you understand the ordering process you will not be disappointed with the quality of the food and the efficient service provided. The menu choice is wide and varied whether you want a light snack or something more filling. The pork dumplings are wonderful.
Fantastic dinner at a great price,"We had to wait around 30 minutes to get a table (no bookings for less than 8 people) but boy was it worth it. The best dumplings I have ever tasted - they literally melted in your mouth with an explosion of flavours. We ate plentifully and had the jasmine tea, all for a very reasonable price of $20. Very excited to hear they are opening a branch in London soon!"
Frequent Din Tai Fungers,"There are a few branches of Din Tai Fung around Singapore and this one has become our go to branch for the weekend, because it is normally a bit less busy than the other branches. Do not normally need to queue or reserve.

We find Din Tai Fung to have consistently good quality and some classic dishes from Taiwan (where the chain originated) like their braised beef noodle soup. Very reliable.

On our last visit here, I think they were quite severely understaffed. There was a queue although not that many people in the restaurant and the food took quite a while to arrive. I hope they can get more staff."
Meals served hot.,"This restaurant is always busy. When we finally got a chance to try it we were with a Chinese friend so he knows a lot on the menu. He ordered shrimp and pork dimsum, braised beef soup, hainanese chicken, fried duck in wrappers, crab meat dimsum, fried rice and mango dessert. Everything was served hot. Every dish is cooked fresh and full of flavor. But since there is a big crowd inside expect the place to be a bit noisy. If you are choosing good conversation over good food this isn't the place for you.
Tip: Book a reservation or come in early for dinner to avoid the crowd. It gets really crowded on weekends but it is the only restaurant open until 10 pm."
Less than Expected Quality,Had dinner there. Was expecting excellent food given the good reviews. Was disappointed by the xiao long bao. It seems something was missing. Could not fault the service as they attended to us promptly.
a lazy Saturday appetizing lunch,"~Marina Bay Link Mall's DTF is exceptionally easy to walk in after 1.30pm on a Saturday, although still half full we managed land a table for 6 almost immediately

other than mains for each of us we had an order of 1 each of every item on the appetizer menu

i kid you not DTF really knows their food & flavors

everything was as appetizing as we expected :)"
Dumplings forever,"Great choice, great food great service outside USS. Went with friends instead of eating at USStudios and were very pleased with quality"
Worst service of any Din Tai Fung,"The food was delicious as always but the service was completely unaware of us wanting to submit our order, interested in clearing a huge stack of empty plates sitting on the table for 30+ minutes, or interested in any enjoyable experience what-so-ever. I've always loved visiting this chain, but this particular location I'll definitely avoid in the future."
Sensational Singaporean lunch,Worked up an appetite at Garden by the Bay and loved the location....downstairs in the Mall out of the heat. Brilliant dumplings and rice dishes. Definitely recommended
Some of the best Chinese food I have had,"As everyone has stated, the dumplings here are divine.

It was crowded and we had to wait, even at 7:30 at night, they seem to be aware of this because they give a sheet to fill out to complete your order before you get to your seat.

It hits the spot though, I would hit one of these locations before you leave Singapore."
Tasty Shanghainese food,"Though there's always a long queue for getting into the restaurant, the wait is worth it. The service is excellent, especially you are given the menu and order form before you actually enter the place. Thus, the food can be immediately served once you sit down. Authentic Shanghainese food, with a great variety to choose. This is definitely the place you won't miss out if you wanna try some tasty Chinese food!"
Pork chop rice & stir fry spinach,"Whilst most people would approve of their xiao long bao, it does meet my expectation with the thick folds of skin & not so juicy/not melt in the mouth pork fillings. Imperial Treasure serves the best xiao long bao.

I would recommend the pork chop fried rice (even more delicious paired with julienne ginger & vinegar), stir fry spinach (delicious, non oily & leaves a clean taste), hot & sour soup (ask for this to be served very hot, whets up an appetite)."
Best affordable great quality Chinese food around Marina Bay area,"There is a reason why every Din Tai Fung (Michelin star awarded) outlet in Singapore is perpetually busy, with long queues during the peak lunch and dinner times.

This is one restaurant where one can get consistently delicious fresh food of the highest quality, and yet at decently low price points.

Each outlet is with simple, but pleasing decor.

I always enjoy their famous signature steamed pork dumplings (xiao long baos), with their trademark minimum 18 folds. It is also interesting to watch them hand-making these dumplings, individually.

A perennial favourite of mine is their hearty fried pork chop with noodle soup. It can also come with fried rice. It pairs well with their chilli oil. Their appetiser Oriental salad is very tasty.

Vegetarians can also try their vegetable dumplings as well as hot and sour soup, together with various vegetable dishes.

Their hot Chinese tea is reasonably priced, and refillable.

Service is extremely fast and efficient.

Some of my colleagues actually call ahead for takeaways during dinner, when they stay late in the office.

Hence, this is indeed a favourite restaurant of ours, which is highly recommended.

Helen
Singapore"
Awesome Dim Sum,"This Taiwanese branch NEVER disappoints. It has consistent quality regardless which branch you visit in SIngapore . Throughout the ten years that I have eaten at Din Tai Fung, it is always the same satisfying experience."
Soup dumplings!!!!,"Itâ€™s true! Din Tai Fung really does taste better in Asia!!! I could eat heaps of xiao long bao (soup dumplings) for days. Perfectly made, these little soup dumplings are seriously a happy medley in my mouth. Depending on which location you go to, some may have an hour long wait (ahem Orchard Road). However, this location seemed a bit more remote (itâ€™s in the basement of a corporate building), so we had no issues with the wait time. They were really on top of their service too! Attentive, but not overbearing. We ordered, and in no time, our food was out already. Great experience! Must eat at a Din Tai Fung while in Singapore! Any Din Tai Fung will do!"
Super Restaurant !,"Din Tai Fung is another best Chinese food restaurant in town. Whenever me and my husband go there, we always order spicy noodle bowl and drunken chicken. Their noodle are so great that they are soft and homemade taste.
Another thing is chicken dumpling, very very nice must try dumpling. Soft, watery and fresh dumpling. The real Chinese taste like you might think yourself that you are in China."
Quick Serve Location for good food - Diappointed execution overall,"At this location, we went to eat on a Sunday afternoon. We went to the hostess stand and received a number that would be called along with a clipboard with the ordering menu common among all Din Tai Fung locations. We were expected to complete our ordering while waiting for our table to come available.
When we were taken to our table, the waitress took our clipboard and the order was taken. though I was paying full serve prices on the menu in money. I was disappointed.
The second disappointment was the sporadic delivery of the food items depending on when they were finished by the kitchen. They were spread out over more than ten minutes.
This is not the quality of a one star restaurant, rather a fast food restaurant.
The food was generally good but the enjoyment was diminished by the service.
Nobody cared to ask if we were satisfied, wanted anything else, or how was the overall experience."
oooooooooohhhhhhhhhh,we went to eat instant noodles there and the staff there were very kind .there was a water fountain there
Queuing out the door - and with good reason!,"Went for lunch with a colleague when I was working in Singapore. This is a very popular lunch venue and with good reason! Famous for its pork dumplings which you can watch them make, as well as a whole variety of steamed buns and noodles.

Stand out dishes for me were steamed bun stuffed with chilli crab, spicy pork noodles but most definitely the pork dumplings. I'd had other dim sum whilst in Singapore, but nothing like these. They were piping hot, full of flavour, yet so light and delicate.

Definitely would return here, as there were so many other dishes I wanted to try. You have to make sure you get there early or else be prepared to queue."
Best dim sums ever,"Yes u need to wait for at least 30 minutes as they don't take reservation . the place is always full as they serve simply amazing food. The kitchen is glass walled and so you can actually see the process of making dim sums. Very healthy, tasty and hygienic food. Definitely worth waiting."
Waited for our dinner,"We had a long day and wanted to have a delicious meal at the Marina Bay area. We were so hungry but we had to wait for almost an hour and the restaurant had no waiting area/chairs for the public. I'm not sure if it's the waiting, but apart from it as a treat to us, I find the food to be not so special, and their service just ok."
"Good quality food, albeit over-hyped and over-priced","My family of 2 adults and 2 kids ate dinner here in early September. We arrived at about 7 pm and was told there was a 40 min queue for a table. We were given an order form to complete whilst waiting. Even though this branch was in an underground link mall in the business district on a Sunday evening, it was packed!!

The food was well prepared and seasoned. We enjoyed every dish we ordered. The Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) were a little disappointing, being small in size and with very little soup in them. The crab dumpling was particularly ""fishy"" in flavour. The pork dumplings we ordered (jiao zi) were delicious, tasty and juicy. The skin of the dumplings were just right, not too thick and doughy and held the contents well. The beef noodles were hearty and tasty.

When we left, there were still many people queueing for tables! Good quality food, clean but fairly noisy environment, nothing posh. Queue, eat and go."
Happy Place,I've never had felt happy with food until I've tasted the delicious Xiao Lang Bao! It was heavenly and it made me feel so much happiness that I've wanted to eat more of it. I hope I'll be able to eat one of these soon back home.
Amazing dinner,"Amazing dumplings, so light, so subtle. Prawn pancake was tremendous. The greens as well. What a fabulous experience!"
Worth Visiting,"Originally from Taiwan , the food at DTF is amazingly tasty always. If you want to have Dumplings and Hot&Sour soup head to this place. It is light on the wallet relative to other places in the Link Mall."
Delicious Dim Sum!,"We had an assortment of dim sum, fried won tons, fried egg rolls and shrimp fried rice. Everything was really good! They were quite busy when we arrived and warned that the food would take 30 minutes to come out, but we were eating after a wait of less than 10 minutes. Would return to this restaurant next time we're in Singapore, for sure. Our meal came out to about US$18 per person, which wasn't bad at all considering that this is Singapore and we were hungry!"
Come early and come hungry,"This DTF branch is near our SG office - connected via underground maze of stores, shops and restaurants. We made it a point to be here before 11:30am to be seated immediately. By that time, there's already a small line being formed.I enjoyed the selection of dumplings (shao long bao - as always), noodle dishes and steamed vegetables. Was treated by my colleagues so I xannot comment on the cost but I am aware it's a tad higher than other similar eatablishments. Well justified, if you ask me."
Fine Chinese cuisine,The Marina Bay Link Mall outlet of DTF is the only one we ever go to in Singapore. It is the only one where we manage to find a table in a timely manner. The food itself is sensational. All freshly made and served hot as they come out. The staff don't speak a lot of English but service is generally good
"Great food, always long queues","We are regular cusotmers to a number of DTFs across Singapore and are never dissapointed. This is great cooking and is consistently served across the Island. We take friends and family alike and they are always very impressed. Fried rice with pork chop, pork and veg wantons and black sesame dumplings are delicious :)"
Finest Chinese Cuisine,"Really liked the Din Tai Fung in Singapore. In my personal opinion it might even taste better than the one I had in Taipei. You can safely judge a chinese restaurant's standard just from the fried rice it serves and their Pork Chop Fried Rice checks all the right boxes. Great egg to rice ratio, nice beads of rice that do not clump, fried pork chop with a light soy marinate and peppered finish. I always have this with a dip of vinegar. Dumplings are great here too. Served piping hot, the skin holds the meat broth so delicately and explodes flavor all in one bite. This restaurant serves food throughout the day from lunch till dinner. Visit during off peak period for quicker sitting time as all their outlets get packed really quickly."
Be prepared to queue,"The queue is generally longer than other branch and they're mostly tourists visiting MBS. Food is comparable to other branch so you probably better off visiting other branch. See their website for latest outlet lists, there seem to be new one popping up each year.."
Best dumplings,"We came by recomendation, and we've to say that we ate the best dumplings ever. We had to wait a little, but before entring the restaurant tou have a screen which indicates the estimated waiting time."
Great Dumplings,"Visited with the family, all the dumplings and buns were fantastic, highly recommend the pork variety. Finish off with the chocolate lava dumplings, big success."
Really good and clever.,"The little dumplings are made on site and you can watch it. Nice pork ones, nice crab ones. Good rice and veg too. Cheap and extremely popular restaurant. If you turn up for dinner or lunch you must arrive early or the queue is over 1 hour!!! Would go here again."
Amazing dim sum,I was here for dinner with a friend (who was just in Singapore for one night) and we loved the food. I would especially call out the chilli crab dumplings - surprising (but could have been spicier). We came early so had no issue with seating.
Over Rated,"Disappointing, food was nice but not as good as expected based on reviews, Dumplings average, overpriced for quality of food, beer was very expensive $12.50 for one beer. Chain store franchise style of restaurant."
Dinner with Friends - DELISH!,"We ate at the well-loved Din Tai Fung, Marina Bay location, because you can easily walk there from the Gardens by the Bay, which is where we were headed after dinner. Take your chances because you canâ€™t make reservations and the place will most likely be packed. But the food is soooooo good! You wonâ€™t be disappointed."
Huge selection of asian food,We were impressed by the huge selection of asian food in this restaurant. Waiting time to get a table was long but then the service was fast. All we had was very tasty.
Great food and prices,We stopped in here for lunch today. We found there was a bit of a delay being seated but the staff were very courteous. The food was piping hot and quite tasty. All this and reasonably priced.
