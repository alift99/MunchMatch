Overrated and overpriced,"Read the reviews and spent a $18 cab there to see how “amazing” it was. It’s a busy place ran by retired pensioners, grumpy lady didn’t get my order right, the beers and drinks have no price. $8 for a beer?!?!? Noodles were ok, spring roll ok.
Disappointed overall, not great at all"
A Delicious Authentic Cantonese Restaurant in the heart of Singapore,"Staying in Singapore for 4 days and looking for a good quality Chinese restaurant. This place had numerous good write-ups as a well deserved and long established reputation for quality, good value food. W camd for an early dinner and were immediately seated by a very friendly and helpful staff. Orders place and the service was quick. The fried spring foll was large, cut into 4 pieces and very flavorful. I had the pork fried rice, assorted vegetables and the sweet and sour pork. All excellent. I can only compare it to a restaurant I knew over 40 years ago where the food was of this quality. The restaurant is nothing fancy but has a great reputation for quality food and they do! As a Chef I will be coming back when in Singapore."
Excellent Food,"Well deserves its long established reputation for quality, good value food. Very friendly and helpful staff too.
Quick service.
My wife thought the BBQ Pork there was the best she has ever tasted.
We both then also enjoyed our noodle seafood, mixed vegetables and the spring rolls also lived up to their great reputation.
Not fine dining but fine food.
Popular with both other westerners and locals"
Excellent food you must try,"Excellent food! My first time here and I love every food served on my table: fried rice, curry, fog leg, vegetable. They all taste so good i could not stop eating up everything."
Our last Singapore meal on our holidays,"We were taken here by a local for our last night before we flew off to the UK. It is our friends local Cantonese with no pretensions - you will either love it or hate it. I enjoy Cantonese food and this is at its rustic peak -a bit rough and ready- but top quality in its way. I loved the prawn dish with big, beefy prawns- delicious."
What a feast! Loved it,My wife and I were recommended to go here from a friend and we were not let down. The staff chose the food for us and it was amazing. Best I have eaten in a long time. Can’t go past the spicy beef clay pot!
Great Chinese Meal,The food and service is excellent. A large menu with a good range of food. The prawn dishes are excellent and pork amazing. A must to visit for a lunch or dinner.
Great place to have Cantonese,"Great place to have Cantonese food. Great portion, tasty and priced reasonably. We had 2 portions of their horfun. Both taste great, the seafood as well as beef horfun had the wok hai flavour. Other dishes such as their daily soup, stir fried dohmio, spring roll, roasted chicken, homemade tofu and sweet sour pork were awesome. Their fried squid was tasty as well. Many dishes such as their duck and charsiew has not been tasted.Popular among locals and one enter from the side of the Burlington building. Service was quick and reservations may be needed because it’s a popular restaurant just behind Sim Lim Square."
Authentic Cantonese Food,Always enjoy the good authentic Cantonese food in this restaurant. Price is reasonable and good service.
Lest we forget.,Just read an article about how the original Fatty helped smuggle food to our starving prisoners of war during world war 11. I will definitely visit when next in Singapore.
The same ole Fattys.,I cannot start to tell you my search for this restaurant for the last 30 years. I had been a patron in the 60’s and I was pleased that the taste stayed consistent through generations. Highly recommended for local delights especially the chilli crab.
Great meal,"Thank you to “Skinny” who served us a lovely meal, and suggested ideas to us. Simple food , well cooked."
Great value lunch,This place is quite famous amongst Flight and Cabin Crews and usually associated with a lot of over eating! However it was just me for lunch and I thoroughly enjoyed my noodle dish and Tiger beer. I had come to this area specifically to eat at Fattys and wasn't disappointed. I hear the salted prawns are good! Just two minutes from Rocher MRT.
Iconic!,"This place is a historical icon on the restaurant scene in Singapore and definitely worth a visit for anyone!

This is my third visit to this restaurant and I'm never disappointed, the food is always outstanding and the service is always with a smile.

This restaurant has been here for years (I think 40?) and is definitely a favourite of mine every time I'm in Singapore."
Childhood Comfort Food,"This is a no-frills traditional Chinese eatery. My family and I have been patronizing it since we were very young. We will have a family meal there for special occasions like birthdays. Here we will order our usual comfort food like the roast meats, combination vegetable soup, sweet sour prawns, fried spring rolls etc.
The quality of the food has never changed although the management of the restaurant has been passed on to the younger generations of ""Fatty's"" family. The food is to die for....."
Superb food at very reasonable prices,"Basic decor, out of the way location, limited drinks offering, average service; absolutely superb food at very reasonable prices! If you’re in Singapore be sure to try it."
Dinner with family and friends,"I’ve visited this place quite often for good Cantonese food (and tastes like how most Malaysians will cook). You need to make a reservation for dinner or it’s not easy to get a table! Pricing is not bad; spring rolls, roasted duck is good and so is the roasted/fried whole chicken (With pepper and salt condiment), salted egg prawns are juicy and delicious! Give anything on the menu a try, it’s good!"
The best.,"We were staying just down the road and made this our local .Great chinese food .We soon found out why it gets so many good reviews.Yummy crab, fish and chicken dishes.Very happy and friendly staff.Pretty spartan surroundings but you dont eat the surroundings.Highly recomended"
"Homecooked feel, not bad","Had dinner here and the food was generally tasty, has a nice home cooked feel and service was good. We ordered a crab which was decent, a steamed fish which was tasty and some vegetables and chicken. Decent."
Fresh and delicious,"Don’t be put off by the look of this place, it is very rustic, nothing fine dining about it but the Chinese food here is fresh, served quickly and well executed. It was super busy on the two occasions I went for lunch but they always squeezed me in without a drama. The staff were lovely, helpful and attentive and the meals delicious. Would recommend to anyone. Just don’t bother opening the towelette they put on the table as you will be charged additional for it. The fresh lime juice is really good."
"Great food, great price!","Great food, great price! A popular place that serves outstanding food. Popular with tourists and ex pats. You are going for the food. Well known with many frequent visitors to Singapore has become an institution."
Fatty’s is really good food in a local city area,"We had been here when last in Singapore and couldn’t resist going back.Fatty’s has been run by Skinny ,his son for a few years.
We had a great meal,pepper prawns,roast chicken ( Australians would call it crispy skin chicken) and yang chow fried rice ( basically egg and pork) and a couple of Tsing thow beers
Don’t go here for the decor but if great local food at a fair price is what you need this is the place for dinner"
Non pretentious Chinese restaurant,"This is a longtime established restaurant here in Singapore not to be confused with a few similar namesakes, for eg. Fatty Weng.
Not a Cantonese myself, I can’t vouch for the authenticity of its Cantonese taste but as a Singaporean Chinese, I think it’s food is not bad for local Chinese food standards and you probably won’t go wrong here if you run out of Chinese places to dine.
Prices may not be considered cheap given its fuss-free but clean dining environment but with its location just within city boundaries, rental is probably high as with labour costs. However, if you compare their prices with the usual suspects bandied about in travel guides, Wing Seong’s prices can be considered relatively cheaper as it is lesser known, even amongst locals.

Not sure about its relation to Fatty Weng in Smith Street and another Fatty Weng in Bukit Batok - maybe all were ex-chefs of the original Fatty Weng at the old Singapore Badminton Hall which has closed."
Dont judge a cook by the cover,"Super food -duck /fried rice/ green veg ,Shiraz wine got in shop 2 doors away.Waitress
Amy there 20 years (she said) looked after us famously.Returned and dined there again — Ritz Carlton our hotel had no knowledge of “Fattys”— the consierge does now
Thank you for two great meals ignore fact it’s not silver service."
Average Chinese Food — Hyped up,"Not sure why this was sold as “the best meal” people had in Singapore, but it was decent and above average. Normal, Americanized Chinese it for a Jumbo instead."
Excellent Food,"I visited the restaurant based on recommendations from 2 of my foodie colleagues. The restaurant is known for its authentic Chinese food and nothing else...

The food was excellent and the service was very quick. I had the 'ginger crab' on my last day of stay and it was very tasty. The pork and beef items were also very good. My kids really enjoyed the 'prawns fried rice'. The quantity of food was huge, hence we had to select the medium option.

In terms of ambience, similar to other family driven restaurants, there was practically nothing. However, the restaurant was very clean. The owner and the staff maintain a good relation with the patrons, hence most of the customers are repeat.

Despite, many fine-dining options, I had dinner on all the 4 days of my stay in Singapore, in this restaurant, only because of the food quality and reasonable price."
Great Food a Singapore Tradition,"I have been eating at Fatty's for over 50 years. The food has always been brilliant. I miss the days when the Australian dollar bought $3.25 Singapore, now the Aussie dollar barely buys 87 cents. All that aside the food is fantastic. Skinny and I go back to the days when he first started after completing National Service, we virtually grew older together.
Feasted this time on Fantastic home made spring rolls, Black Pepper Prawns, Claypot Chicken, Chicken with Cashew nuts, Singapore Chilli Crab and super tasty fried rice. Yummy beyond belief.
A must do when in Singapore."
If you want the best chinease food in authentic Singapore enviroment... this is it!!!,It just doesn't get any better ... arrive tell Fatty how many you are are and sit... he or she will ask you what you don't like and then feed you with the bestest Chinese food you will ever had experienced ... you will never have to look up for something it will be there before you think about it... your glass will never be empty and it doesn't break the bank... great value for money and service with a smile in a great setting.... go on enjoy...
Amazing taste for reasonable prices,"Went here on Sunday night looking for Chili Crab - we weren’t disappointed. The service was very swift but sadly not all our food arrived at the same time, which I usually prefer. The crab took longer, so we tucked into the amazing butter orawns and the mushrooms with veggies. It was so tasty! Then the crab arrived, which was 65SD the kilo. It was very messy and a little difficult to eat but we were absolutely new to eating crab. We really enjoyed our fuzz free dinner experience and would recommend going."
Fantastic food and value,"Have visited Fatty's many time, it is consitently good. Service is good food is better.

We had chicken in a clay pot, spicy, a must have, sweet and sour fish, chilli prawns, seafood Singapore noodles and rice. Ample for three.

The menu is extensive but my advice is to discuss with the staff what you want and they will sort it out.

Spicy is very tasty but personally I would have liked more chilli.

It shuts around 9.30 to 9.45, we arrived just after 10.00 the previous evening and it was closed."
Top recommendation,Went here on a recommendation and glad we took the time! Possibly the best Sweet & Sour Pork I’ve had. It’s simple but very well done. Duck is great as are the rice dishes. It’s busy so that’s always a good sign in my book.
Great local food at a great price,"We dined here as a family a few nights ago and I was very impressed.

This place isn't fancy but what it does is offer great service and really good food at a really reasonable price. The medium sized plates are more than adequate and the food is really tasty.

We enjoyed pepper crab, bbq pork, special fried rice and crispy noodles. We were all full at the end and the kids loved it.

Highly recommend if you're looking for honest and tasty Chinese Singaporean food that won't break the bank."
Fantastic!,"Great friendly attentive staff and The food is awesome!!! Big big servings and so so tasty, couldn’t possibly fault it.
Very reasonably priced and the drinks were also cheap and the beer was cold!
For three of us with 2 starters, 3 main dishes, two fried rices and 2 very large bottles of beers each was about $100.
Couldn’t fault anything! Left feeling very satisfied indeed."
perfect food and service,"the food and service was remarkably great, authentic and memorable. The recommendation from the staff was perfectly enjoyable. chilli prawns, fried rice and garlic spinach. the garlic spinach wasn't on the menu but the staff member recommended this as the best combination, which it was."
Great Local Restaurant,"We had a lovely meal- entertaining waiter!! Chilli prawns and shredded duck noodles were yummy!!The Indonesian chicken wasn't a great choice.
Far from a fancy restaurant bur good local food. You can bring wine or buy at the shop nest door.
$65 Singapore dollars for dinner and $35 for the wine"
Best Cashew Chicken ever,We were really overwhelmed because of the many choices of different dishes but the staff was very helpful and suggested a meal perfectly fitting our preferences. Our dinner was so delicious that we just couldn't stop eating although the serving sizes are so generous. We would definitely come back and highly recommend this place.
Best restaurant!,Me and my friend were overwhelmed by the friendly and helpful service! The food was great and really authetic!!
Amazing Chinese food!,"We were here with our two kids aged 8 and 10 and we all loved it. So fresh and tasty. Spring rolls are HUGE! We got chicken fried rice and pork fried rice for the kids, sweet and sour pork and noodles with chicken and veg for us. Everything was so delicious and it was hard to leave any but we had to as we were so full. Would thoroughly recommend. Price was also good value for money."
An old favourite,One of the best chinese in Singapore. The salt and spicy prawns are superb and the spring rolls are a must!
Celebrated special Birthday Here,"I first went to Fatty's in 1962 when I was in the RAF and stationed in Singapore
Now whenever I am in Singapore it is a must to go and have a genuine Chinese Meal
My wife and I always have a special welcome
This year my family came as well - my youngest Granddaughter (aged 14) said ' I can see what you mean by a good Chinese meal'
The standard is always very high and friends who I recommend to come to Fatty's always come back to England raving about how good it is
I am looking forward to my next visit to Singapore and a trip round to Fatty's
This July on a 14 day holiday I went four times - once to celebrate a special birthday

If you want a good meal in Singapore I would well recommend a trip to Fatty's"
Family dinner with cousins,"Why I will do back again: 1. Reasonably priced - $130 for 8 dishes for 6 of us 30-40 years old indviduals 2. Tasty local home cooking ""zi char"" 3. Good place for family dinner 4. Accessible - 2min from rochor mrt"
Excellent food and value,"Had been meaning to get here for a few years and 4 of us went for dinner tonight. Busy tables at 9pm so we guessed it was still good. Great spring rolls to start, then roasted pork, fried rice x2 , Kang Kong, chicken with mushrooms , assorted vegetables, sweet and sour chicken. All were great, tasted like proper Chinese and the chicken dishes were especially good. Had three large beers, 2 waters and 2 soft drinks and the Bill was only $116 SGD."
Best Sweet Sour ever,"Great place to eat when in Singapore. Super friendly staff, great food, nice mix of local and international folks and reasonable prices. Will definitely go there again..."
"Rude service , good food","Went here with six friends 11 July. I arrived ahead of my group and asked for a table for seven. I was aggressively moved from one table to another and even asked to rearrange the seating myself.
I asked for help tin ensure that enough food was ordered. This was begrudgingly given. Yes , it was getting close to closing time , but with a bill over £180 , it was a shame to be treated so shabbily. We were also overcharged for drinks. With many other places here , I’m loath to go back. A shame as the food was great.
I believe the waitress was the owners wife"
What we liked,We had great dinning experience at very reasonable price. The service is professional and friendly. The food is delicious and portions are reasonably generous. I recommend roast pork and duck. Local chinese Singaporeans seem to love this authentic chinese cuisine with heart.
Dinner for 5,"Food is excellent with great variety, fresh and well prepared. Not a cheap eats but you enjoy what you pay for. About as Singapore gets to hawker stall food"
Very nice food.,"Located in between to Bugis & Albert squares, the restaurant is quite easily accessible. Food served fresh & tasty. Service is quite prompt. Prices are quite reasonable.

Food quality is good and delicious. Had beef? Frog legs, tofu and veggies. My family gave it thumbs up.

Try not to go too late in the evening as they start winding down after 9.30 pm.

Happy eating"
Good Food,"If you are looking for good and reasonably priced Chinese food cooked in Cantonese style, this is definitely the place to go to. Try out their soup of the day, that changes daily. You can try their fried noodles and rice, it is really good and brought back my childhood memories."
Disappointing,"After living in the Philippines for years we were looking forward to some authentic Chinese. This place did not live up to the reviews. The chicken fried rice was bland, the vegetable plate was good and the Char Sui was just char sui. Our hotel was just around the corner but we opted for the food court across the patio instead of giving Fatty's another try."
Simple with great food,"Looking simple, this restaurant has great food and great dishes. Everything we ordered was fresh tasty and great, so was the service"
"Simple looking, stunning food","Omg!!! The food there is on of the best chinese I ever had. Very generous portions, mindblowing flavours, fresh ingrediants, easy international atmosphere. We even had a very interesting chat with the owner who still works extremly hard at his age. My respect and admiration! Don't miss to eat there!"
"Fab amosphere,fab food","Busy restaurant,fresh and absoutely delicious food!Must try:Black pepper prawns/beef,spring rolls,fried rice/ noodles.Missing the food already while writing this review..."
Great tasting food,"I guess this could be the sort of place you walk past as it does not look too posh, don't be fooled.

Its generally very busy after 7 so if you want a table without a wait get there before.

Its difficult to say what is best to eat as every time we have been its been excellent.

And its nice to get a reasonably priced beer in Singapore as well."
JUST THE BEST FOOD EVER,Why can we not get food like this in the UK. Delicious. Great atmosphere. Very busy. The best Asian Cuisine I have ever had.
Very casual but good food,"This was my first my first visit. We came because of the history of the owner’s Grandfather’s actions during WWII.
We sat outside by a couple of fans. Is was hot out but the fans made it tolerable. We shared bok choy, pepper beef, and a ginger chicken that wasn’t on the menu. We each had a Tiger beer too. Everything came out hot and super tasty. The service was good and everyone was friendly.
I wanted to get shave ice after, but we were full.
The place was popular. The stream of customers kept coming while we were there. Large groups and couples. I will definitely return"
Highly Recommended Restaurant,This is a no frills Chinese restaurant which offers both outdoors and indoor air conditioned seating. What draws the crowds there is the menu offering a vast variety of Chinese food .The food is delicious and portions ok.Prices are reasonable except when ordering fresh seafood items as prices are pegged to the weight. We were a party of 7 and ordered 8 dishes ( minus fresh seafood items) plus 2 bottles of Tiger beer...... our bill came to only S$ 127.Food is served fast and unlike most popular restaurants you do not feel the “ push” to leave after you finish your meal.The restaurant is very popular for tourists as well as expatriates and reservations is recommended especially dinner time.
Tasty Chinese Food,"This restaurant was recommended to me by several Singapore friends. It looked a bit 'no frills' when we arrived for lunch. A simple laminated menu. The food was excellent. We shared Chicken with Cashew nuts, a quarter of Crispy Duck, Mushrooms and Vegetables and Chicken Fried Rice. Generous portions and we managed to eat it all. Quick and efficient service."
"Authentic local cuisine, good dining experience","We came for dinner on a Sunday, be prepared to wait if you did not made reservation as there are less than 25 tables (both aircon and outdoor dining).
Wing Seong has been around for long and build up a good reputation with close cliental.
Very nice selection of local Cantonese menu spread. Orders are taken quickly and the food arrives promptly. We ordered a braised fishhead, cereal prawns, Sweet & Sour Pork vermillion meat, roast chicken, chilli kangkong & also broccoli veg.
The sliced-duck noodle taste very well stands out, but the hor fun is more flat due to its gravy. The chicken (skin) is crispy and meat just nicely done. The broccoli came with several bulbs of fried garlic that lifted the whole taste well, not oily too. The fish head is more complicated, not too battered and meaty enough. Just have to be careful with bones, haha!
Only 1 dessert available; Jelly Logan. But it did not disappoint, taste nice!
Service is ok, dish arrives reasonably spread out and they replaced our plates when they noted it looks messy.. We ordered the mid-sized portion, and the pricing is definitely competitive, will be back and we recommend to others too.."
Great no frills meal,"Popped in one night and managed to get a table straight away. Service was quick and food arrived promptly. Our meals though not probably adventurous were very tasty and the portions were very good. Staff were very friendly and gave us the choice of fork, spoon and chopsticks. All in all we would heartily recommend this restaurant."
Best meal in Singapore,"A group of us went to Fatty’s for lunch the other day and had a great meal. This restaurant is iconic and the quality of the food and the service is excellent.
The staff are all friendly and take good care of you, we were given a table outside while we waited for our inside table to be prepared and the staff made sure we all had drinks and were comfortable.
As there were 8 of us eating we sampled a number of dishes and all were fantastic. As you can imagine as a large group we stayed and talked for a long time and there was no pressure to leave.
This was a great lunch at a top restaurant, do yourself a favour and try Fatty’s"
Recommended,"Friends told us to come here. It’s just a small restaurant and tables fill quickly.
Staff showed us to a table in the next restaurant and served us there, we just had to by drinks from the next restaurant.
We had a small portions of a beef and chicken dish and shared fried rice with a couple of spring rolls.
This was more than enough for us and the flavours were absolutely amazing.
Price was even better at only $27!!
Well worth a visit to savour Chinese street food."
A great experience,"This restaurant is always our first port of call on arrival in Singapore. Our latest visit was up to its usual standard. This is a 'no frills' restaurant where dining is 'al fresco' and the food delicious. Orders are taken quickly and the food arrives promptly. Our meal comprised Sweet & Sour Pork, Singapore noodles, Crispy Beef and mixed vegetables. So yummy! The Tiger beer comes in large bottles and is the perfect accompaniment to the meal. Don't expect too many smiles from the staff however, That apart, Fatty's is a real gem and shouldn't be missed, thoroughly recommend it."
Tasty,"Asked for recommendations and decided on pepper shirp, fried rice and spring roll. Everything tasted nice and the price was good as well."
Excellent Chinese fantastic service,"Fatty's is just a fantatsic restaurant and expeerince. There is a very extensive menu but my advice is to forget that. We did. I explained what we were looking for, king prawns, chicket in a pot, noodles, etc how hot we wanted it and he suggested what we could have.

It was excellent."
LIKE AT HOME,"We discover this place on lucky way and we really enjoy about the food . Well you have mode spicy or mode soft but we feel really good and satisfied all week because it was our meeting point for dinner .

Nice place to enjoy with locals and have some Tiger beer !!!"
A well known eating place.,"An old established and well known restaurant still popular with the expatriate community. Chinese cuisine (somewhat westernised) with as the name suggests, adequate portions.
Can be crowded even during midweek so a table reservation would be helpful, particularly if one prefers outside seating.
Local beer is available. If full, the inside seating can be noisy."
Yummy!,"The food was really good! Quick service, very nice staff. Overall really happy with my visit. The place was packed so you know it’s good!"
Good Zi Char,Pretty good food - particularly the Indonesian chicken! Decent prices though the serving portions are a little small. Would probably come back again.
Exquisite cantaness style,"Came back from gardens by the bay late to ibis bencoolen. Delighted to see this top ranked restaurant opening and no one Q. Ordered beef stirred w/h rice noodles, salted eggs with prawns, good taste. If you happen to stay ibis bencoolen and wanna try something different from built in restaurant. Wing sent fatties is THE one."
Great food,"The queue is so long and not sure where the queue starts from because they are all over the place. Service not very good. Had to wait for quite a long time before someone asked us table for how many.
Waited awhile before we got our table. We sat on the table before the dirty plates are cleared. They made us stand behind the table that are finishing soon.
Food wise, it's pretty nice and the portion are alright. One of the staff that took our order can memorise everything that we order without writing down.
Great food and there are a lot of people. Need to queue."
"Great lunch, family business","We had king prawns in a sauce that complimented them nicely and the duck noodles. Split between two, it was a tasty lunch. Lots of local families and standard menu.. Though the frog legs and fish heads were different to a US traveler."
Great food,The place is nothing much to look at but the food is great always fresh and delicious and reasonably priced .
"No frills restaurant, but fabulous food","This restaurant was recommended by a friend. Generally we would have just passed this restaurant , but serioulsy, the food was delicious. We cannot comment on this place hightly enough, thank you so much for having us , your chef is incredible. We will visit again"
Lovely friendly place for good value but average food.,We’d been planning to try this place for several years. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and the food is decent enough value. The people and service bring our score to a three because we weren’t particularly impressed with the quality of the food.
Run - don’t walk to Fattys,"This food was amazing. No frills amazing delicious food in Singapore. We had the Indonesian Prawns, the loaded fried rice, fried noodles and BBQ pork and it was all amazing. Highly recommend this joint. You can sit indoors or out and enjoy a nice ice cold glass of Tiger beer."
Great food,"A very family restaurant with some great Chinese food, always crowded good value for money a must visit when you are in Singapore"
Great Food and Service,"We had heard about this place from friends who visit Singapore frequently.
Last night we had dinner with four others who are travelling with us. We let Amy our waitress do the ordering for us and the food was excellent. Very busy with locals is always a good sign and the place did not stop.
I can recommend the Indonesian Chicken as is was delicious.

We will definitely be back thanks for our best meal in Singapore.
:)"
My favorite in Singapore,"Now since 30 years I love this restaurant. Excellent food, casual dresscode for staff and customers. You can order smal, medium and large sizes of your food. My favourites are ginger beef, bbq pork, black pepper prawns and a Tsingdao beer. Very quick service"
Hidden Gem in Burlington Square,A friend and I were looking for a new place to have dinner and we were craving some authentic Chinese food. I did a search here on TripAdvisor and Fatty's came up on top. I had no idea where it was but found it after a quick call. I've walked past this place tons of time in the 7 years I've lived in Singapore and never gave it a second glance. REALLY glad I found it. The owner is friendly and the staff are super helpful. Lots of variety. Try the homemade tofu. I've never been a big tofu fan but this dish may just change my mind. :-)
Not bad,"fair prices and good food, not really far from the marina bay, and surrounded by more options if want to consider also"
"Excellent Chinese, great deal.","Wow.

This was a surprise.

We ordered two orders of Spring Rolls (very good), Chicken Pot (superb) and Singapore Noodles with beef (excellent).

The Singapore Noodles may have been one of the best dishes I've eaten in a Chinese restaurant.

Servings were generous.

Service was prompt and efficient, although nobody would describe our server as talkative.

Total cost, with a pot of tea, was 33 SD (~$24 US).

That's a great deal for a superb meal in a sit down restaurant.

Location was a little challenging.

Although the address is listed as 175 Bencoolen Street, the restaurant was located slightly off that street.

We plan to go again during our stay."
Great value restaurant,Found this little place on our first night singapore. We went back four nights in a row. We had something different everytime. Enjoyed them all. Wide choice of food. Good prices. Friendly staff. Highly recommend.
Good food with Polite service,"It’s our first visit to this restaurant, based on TripAdvisor’s comment, we decided to give it a try.
It’s exactly what others user’s comments, this is really a warm, welcoming and worth for dollars restaurant.
The male owner explained us the menu patiently, recommended us really good food.
We love the Indonesian prawns a lot, especially the coconut milk soup, we drank it all! So delicious and not too spicy, just perfect!
Please trust the comments here and visit! You would not disappointed at all!"
One of the good food,"I was full because of late lunch but after I taste a bit, I could not help eating them up! Home made tofu was soft, tender and tasty. The veggie, Kailan with garlic was super nice. For those nice food, the price was also reasonable. I recommend this local restaurant."
Hardly worth a detour,"This is a tough one.
The owner was on the ball.
Fast service and yes, you can grab a wine from the shop next door.
But here’s the thing....
The food is no more mentionable than what you can buy in a hawker centre at a fraction of the price.
So, probably good for tourists who can’t assimilate with local culture and Qantas trolley dollys who wouldn’t dare be seen in a Hawker.
Used to be good in the 70’s but I guess the times have a changed!
Any hawker or food court will deliver same experience for a fraction of the price.
Sorry Fatty, but you know it!"
Love this place and it's BYO wine,"The food was all suggested by this charming waitress, who suggested 2 dishes, the Indonesian curry and salt and pepper prawns. The prawns and curry were excellent. The food was served hot and quickly. The staff are very friendly and are quick to provide the men with cold Tiger long necks.

We were also attracted to this place because we saw some fellow travellers with a ice bucket and wine in them. We went around to the 7/11 bought a bottle and proceeded ot have a lovely time. No pressure to be moved on either. We went back a second time and everything was as good as the first time.

Love Fatty's"
Great noodles and Indonisian chicken,Been to Fattys many times in the past when visiting Singaporr but never wrote a review as it was back before all this started. Great food reasonable prices for food and beer and excellent service. Just behind Sim Lim Tower.
Must!...,This restaurant changed our all expectations... if you are in Singapur you have to go there!.. We have been in many places on the world and we never ever eat like that.. they can cook amazing delicious.. we will definitely recommend this place.. good price and very very delicious food for good price!
Once again beautiful food,"Fattys is a bit of an institution in Burlington square in Singapore
Visited regularly by airline crews, known for its great food, large helpings and basic tables and chairs.
Service is always fast and helpful, especially advising when you have ordered to much
Great for lunch or dinner, guarantee of a good meal"
Excellent Chinese food.,"Went to this resturant a few times when I went to Singapore for a few days. All the locals go there and you get big tasty portions, can't fault anything at all"
Steamed ginger crab,"Helpful but fairly perfunctory service, probably because we weren't locals! I felt that our presence was tolerated, but not overly welcome. It was lunchtime, and plenty of locals were eating inside. Our crab cost $58 for a moderately sized crab (about 3/4 Kg), but on arrival all of the soft tasty contents from inside the centre of the shell were missing, which my partner found to be very disappointing. Lime juice for $2 and the Mantou for $3 were very good. They said that they had run out of spring rolls! Crab did not seem to be overly fresh and was somewhat overcooked. It was my 3rd visit but won't be going back."
One of my favourites,"This could be one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore and you will not beat the value for money in this very expensive city.
If you're in downtown Singapore and want to try some of the best tasting Singaporean food made by 4th generation restauranteurs then this is a MUST stop on your next visit, if you love duck then I recommend calling the day before to request it and reserve."
Superb food,The food was excellent and reasonably priced. No fancy decor just hot good quality food. Even the medium portion took someone with a hearty appetite quite some time to eat.Staff were all friendly and helpful.
Alright local Chinese food,"After reading some decent reviews for Fatty's I was a little disappointed. The food was ok - I had the beef clay pot which was nice and the duck fried noodles, which there wasn't that much duck and a little oily.

The staff seemed a bit rude and unwelcoming to non-locals. They were also pushy on trying to get me to have beer over soft drinks also.

Alright for a cheaper meal, but wouldn't race back."
Enjoyed it so much the first time that we went out of our way to return a second time,"We were recommended this restaurant by a sales guy in the Sim Lim electrical mall across the way. We would never have wandered into this as it just looks pretty ordinary from the front, but we were so please that we did.

The food was fantastic and very reasonably priced. The staff were friendly with us, particularly the old man who stopped and chatted and regularly ensued everything was ok.

If you are in this area, or frankly, even if you are not, you should deinitely try this place. Really well worth it!"
Excellent Chinese food at reasonable prices!,"Fatty’s is an excellent restaurant for traditional Chinese food. In reality most SINGAPORE restaurants are excellent as they all maintain the same high level of hygiene and preparation.
Fatty’s has delicious food served in acceptable quantity and taste.
A must visit.
Tab for 2 adults and 2 growing children for 3 dishes without drinks was S$49."
Easy going place with good food,Local chinese food for reasonable prices. More locals than tourist. Food was very good. And like busy athomphere. Half of tables are outside.
Great food,"The food was excellent, especially the Chilli-Crab however the Pork & Beef were all outstanding. Found a nice cold Australian Chardonnay across the road the supermarket. fatties provided an ice bucket."
What a surprise!!,"Right next to Sim Lim, Fattys really stands out as great food at realistic prices. The Black Pepper Prawns and Chicken Clay Pot were well above expectations and I wiuld highly recommend for all to enjoy."
Worth to try,"Mixed review - My first is when the local friend and ordered in the food in Chinese language. The food is very nice e.g. sweet and sour pork, prawn omelet (wet style), spicy fried morning glory. However, I went to this place the second time with my foreign friends, and the dishes are more of typical food you can find. Considering the waiter is friendly and the price is reasonable, I would go again."
