Awesome seafood!,The food was super tasty! the best seafood awards stated big at their glass window is not gimmicks‚Ä¶ hubby had a fantastic meal for his big 60! However upset that we didn‚Äôt manage to get the free lobster as it‚Äôs just the both of us dining‚Ä¶ they should not limit the free lobster for just the ordering of 4 pax .. just a little disappointed that we didn‚Äôt get to have that since is his fav overall the food was one of the best I ever tasted great job
Favorite seafood place,It‚Äôs always our family‚Äôs seafood place. The food is tasty and value for money. Ordered a duo set and we were so well fed and satisfied.
Crab experience from head to toe,"This was the first time I have been to a seafood restaurant and I was not disappointed. We ordered Chilli crab, Boiler‚Äôs sampling platter, and Handmade Louisiana Jumbo crab cakes. Everything was very delicious. We have never had a crab before, so it was an experience. I was covered in Chilli crab from head to toe. If you are in Singapore, you definitely have to come to The Boiler."
Nice place for gathering and chill,The birthday promo was a steal. Overall a nice place to chill w friends over seafood in a bag with beer!
Second Visit - abit disappointed,"Before I forget - Marissa the wait staff - commendable :) great attitude and good service.

Food - standard dropped a little compared to the first time i went, which was in Oct 2022. What happened? We ordered a bag to share between two of us. It wasn't as tasty - could have been the sauce we chose. But I also note that for a saturday night, it wasn't quite as crowded as when i went there on a monday night back in October 2022.

Service - was friendly. can't complain. But. we could use with some flexibility with regards to drinks that are easy to make, which are not on menu.

Ambience - was average. Its a family dining place. Definitely not a romantic hangout. :)

Value for money - I wouldn't say its value for money after my second visit.

In all, my second visit left me slightly disappointed."
Poor service,"Went there for birthday celebration. Food overall is fresh but staff is not attentive. Very disappointed not given happy birthday apron. Staff recommend the 3-4pax seafood bag & if can‚Äôt finish can packet home. Or else not entitle free lobster. Honestly Duo bag is more than enough for 2pax.
Improvement in staff service is greatly needed."
Still among the best for American Seafood boil,"It was my first visit to the Boiler at the Esplanade though I had visited the original location before.

The Seafood Bag is still wonderful.

And even though we were there for lunch, they had already ran out of rice!!! Amazing, actually. The week had barely begun.

I know the current bugbear of all the F&B industry is the lack of staff; but it was still very challenging, as I barely understood the staff, and vice-versa. We had to repeat every bit of the conversation, and it wasn't helpful that the rest of the staff were pre-occupied, even though we were only the group at the restaurant at the time. The other group already there had completed their order and was just waiting for their food."
Best meal. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,I can‚Äôt remember having a better more satisfying meal. Service was great and the food was amazing. They have three sauce option. We had the broil bag with the Raging hot sauce. My wife and I really enjoy spicy dishes. This was a great combination of very hot with fantastic flavor.
Great Experience,"I had a great first time experience at The Boiler (Esplanade). In particular, my friends & I were served by La Wun & she was very friendly & nice to us :) The food, service & ambience rlly stood out for me ü§©üëçüèº"
nice food,It's better than chili crab what are the famous chain restaurants. It's so nice and delicious. Service was also good.
Dancing Crab is better,Decided to try as we had a great time at Dancing crab which is similar style of food. Service was very average and not engaging at all. Food came very fast which was good but also gave impression of Pre done. Taste was ok. Not sure why they insist on telling you how long you have to dine when place is half empty even on leaving
Only worth it with free bday lobster,"Decent service but food doesn't taste impressive. The family prefers Dancing Crabs over The Broiler. Lighting were terrible, can't read the menu at all."
Great food & Service,"Went on a Monday Evening. Not a lot of people. Great service, staff was friendly! Food was fantastic. Might look decent size but might be quite a lot for some. Great place for fresh and delicious seafood."
Above average food but very poor service,"The food and pricing is pretty good for a restaurant in Esplanade, however service is still very lacking.

Was there for a birthday celebration and pre concert dinner and drinks but was told at 730pm that we need to leave the table (restaurant was not full, mind you. There are still several empty tables).

If there is a minus star for service I would have given that as when we were still eating, one of the servers (I believe he is new and under training), he kept asking if he can clear our table.

My mother was furious at the end of the day though she enjoyed the food and drinks but was during the service given, she said she will definitely not be back again.

I will probably go to the other branch to give it another chance for service.

Not sure how they got their raving Google reviews as you can see from the reviewers it was en-mass on the same day with hundreds if not thousands of raving good service comments/feedback.

I guess in order to salvage their bad service reputation, they have to resort to PAID REVIEWS(most are 1 rating/reviews only) and almost all feedbacks are the same.

I do sincerely hope you can improve your service for the sake of future customers."
Food & Waiter,"The food is tasty and great, most important the waiters are very courteous. We love the food and enjoy the meal with nice enviroment."
Boiler at esplanade,Staff David was very attentive and tried his best to make my friend's birthday celebration a pleasant experience.
Good food and value for money,"The seafood bag portion is quite generous, the soft shell crab salad is delicious and crab cake is also another surprise"
Food was good,"Been here a couple of times and the food is good. There were times the staff were super friendly and there are times not so much. Overall, it's a place I would so go and enjoy the food."
Average food poor service,Don‚Äôt be late or you have to eat under the watchful eyes of the staff who remind you several times that your time is limited. Not worth the price and hassle
Kat bday,The food we order very nice and very delecious. I will tell my friends to try to go boiler resto barr
Extremely Average,nice selection of seafood but the preparation is just steamed and sauce poured over it creating a mess. you would be better off just having the steamed seafood with the sauce on the side. the seafood also doesn't take on any of the flavor of the spices because it is simply steamed with zero spice.
Birthday Dinner,"One of my Best Birthday dinner Ever! Enjoyed everything!!! The food, The service and the ambiance! It's our second time at the Boiler and will be back again soon... Thanks!!!"
Good experience,"It was my 3rd time to dine in the Boiler. We ordered DUO+ as usual, the spicy degree was just nice! Bought vouchers for next time."
Excellent Service,We had a loving evening and stay rather late and the restaurant needs the table back. The staff was patience and polite with us requesting the table. Thank you Boiler!
Great experience with,"Amazing food, fast service, and friendly staff . I would definitely recommend going there. Taxi drop off close by so easy to get to your next destination after your meal. Would have given a 5 if they had supplied narrow crab forks so you can get to all the meat in the legs etc which seemed wasted."
Food and services,"my first time to eat seafood ü¶û is really delicious wow,services is great, the staff very helpful and friendly, the environment is clean, good for celebrating bday etc‚Ä¶.. I will come back again üòãüòé"
Birthday Celebration,"It was a happy celebration ‚Äòcause the foods are amazing. My kids had 2 batches of their kids‚Äô meal. The bag of seafoods are really great. All thte staff are friendly, accommodating, and always refill our homemade iced lemon tea. Will definitely come back."
Highly recommended,"My sister and I ordered the duo seafood bag. The portions were just right and the seafood was fresh. Really value for money. The service staff went over and above, and opened the door for us as my sister was carrying many things."
Daughter‚Äôs Birthday,Overall experience was fantastic as the service staff had informed us about the menu clearly before we take our order and he also told about the birthday month promo with free lobster for my daughter. The seafood was fresh & juicy too. My family enjoyed our dinner. Will definitely recommend friends too
Mini Family Dinner,First visit To esplanade branch . My parents enjoy and love the food . Food was served pretty fast after placing order . Seafood was fresh .
Never Fail to Amaze!,"I have eat-in at Boiler at Esplanade as well as home-delivery a few times. Everytime was an exciting experience. I love the WORKS (mild) sauce, but my family prefer the Garlic Butter. We saved the sauce to mix with instant noodle for lunch the next day; I tell you, that is supreme! I must admit though eat-in is better because the ""bag"" was piping hot, which is hard to achieve on take-home ones."
Best of the best!,"Great ambience, great food, great experience and GReat Service! what more can I say. This is our 3rd time here. The Howrad road branch somehow pales in comparison."
cake for celebrant not same on other table and on our table,"not served the bday cake with ice cream, reason is bcoz of our order got fudge. however we have 2 celebrant"
Service not so good,I find the signature flavour is not so delicious. Got free bday lobster however free cake not served because our order got chocolate fudge. other bday celebrant got choco lava with ice cream. us don‚Äôt have
Easy seafood in no frills plastic bags,"Easy to order and quite quick service too (17:30) lobsters were easy to eat for adults and kids! No hassle cracking the shells! Enjoyable, will come back."
Just a bad experience overall,"Booked the first dinner slot available at 5pm since we were had been intermittent fasting.
Were told we only had 90 mins before our table would have to be vacated so we ordered our entrees and mains after about 10 mins.
The food came out really quickly. Too quickly. Within 5-10 mins all of the food was on the table. We didn‚Äôt even have enough time to finish our entrees before the seafood was on the table. So we had to ask them to take away half eaten entrees. There was no order to the service and by the time we got onto our mains (2 crabs, shrimp, etc) it was all cold and inedible. We barely ate much of the food and left the restaurant within about 40 mins.
The whole experience was bad for us. The focus appeared to be turning tables over as quick as possible, the food was mostly cold and very bland. Just our personal experience. Would not return or recommend."
Service ok but food not ok,"First visit, the signature haddock fish and chips, too salty and fish not that fresh, chips about the same standard as some hawker stalls. Expecting something special because this is their signature dish. Decided not to order the second dish, walked over to Makansutra Gluttons Bay for my second round, probably a wise choice. Unlikely to return anytime soon."
Great dinner!,"A birthday celebration for my son. We enjoyed our seafood dinner, it was rather fun to get messy. The seafood were really fresh."
Good Customer Service,"Pleasant and warm customer service. Serve by Arinana, if I get her name correctly. Very accommodating and friendly. Volunteer to help us take family photo."
Fresh seafood,The menu could be have slightly clearer that most of the main dishes only serve during lunch time. Otherwise is all good and yummy.
Food review,"The food was cold & ""half"" cook according to my wife. She told me that she got stomach upset & went to toilet twice at home after the dinner at the Boiler. She will not go there again."
We were there for a birthday celebration,"We were there for the very first time to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday. When we first arrived, we were greeted by our server Andrina. Through the reviews from others, we already knew which we wanted to order. *The boomdiggity bag comes with a complimentary boston lobster during birthday month. We were afraid that it would be too much for 2 but anyhow we decided to go on a seafood galore. Service was simple-our server Andrina was polite and even offered to help us take a picture when the food arrived.

I made reservation and was given a table for 2 which can be small if you are ordering sides. Was told the bigger tables are kept for 4 pax but couples who walked in later were given a table for 4.

If there is 1 area to improve, please review the 90mins time frame per table as it is quite short in my opinion. Although the food arrived quickly after we have placed order, our subconscious mind reminded us to eat quickly given the short time frame. We were afraid that we would get ‚Äúbuzzed‚Äù if our 90mins was up Perhaps if diners were given 2hrs, We would have more time to savour and enjoy the food better"
Great dining Experience,The food is great and the service is superb! We didn't wait so long for the food to be served . Excellentüëå
Belated Bday meal,"Booking and rebooking time slot was well managed. The seafood were cooked well.

Service was abit on passive side, I felt there is room for alot of improvement. Meal Time limit of 90min felt like a immediate turnoff, if I am a walk-in customer. 120mins or more will be attractive. this is ala-carte style, not buffet.

Overall, a wonderful meal time with my friends. Might drop by again"
Christmas Dinner - Best!,Service has always been excellent and staff has always been nice too! Food is exceptionally good with all the good vibes. Thank you again!
Delicious seafood meal,"Food was very nice just a bit messy in the eating. Partner was a bit uncomfortable about that but otherwise good food, good service and nice atmosphere."
Great food and service,The seafood was fresh and flavorful! Even the other ala carte dishes like the fish & chips was really good!
"Good food, great service",Good service. Friendly staff. Food was great. Only wish they had steak options (other than ribs) and it would have been a great surf and turf.
Birthday dinner,First time came to boiler Esplanade üòä‚Ä¶ order Chili crab‚Ä¶ super delicious‚Ä¶ also order combo duo bag üòãthe seafood is nice‚Ä¶ worth the price‚Ä¶will recommend ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏èStaff are good‚Ä¶helpful‚Ä¶
"Great meal, great service",Had their premium set with a group of friends. A little expensive but the good was great. The variety of food in their set made the meal quite satisfying as well.
Birthday Babies,"Despite the covid pandemic and less crowd in the restaurant, the food remains fresh and service was attentive. Worth the visit."
Still amazing the 2nd time around!,"Brought my girlfriend here as my experience the 1st time was great! Ordered garlic butter duo bag and it was yummyyyyy. the iced lemon tea was perfect, and we were pleasantly surprised that it's free flow! we'll be back!!"
Dinner reservation,The seafood bag was generous. Thankfully it came with a FOC lobster for birthday. But the lighting was a little dim. Ordering thru the QR code was not friendly but the staff make a great effort to help out too.
Good service good food,"Went on a weekday night and it was quiet. Service was prompt and food was generally up to expectation. However one need to consume fast as the food cool down relatively fast when on the table, didn't help that the aircon was quite strong and directly above us. Needless to say, cold food didn't taste as good. But am most willing to go again to try the other offers on the menu."
Birthday Lunch,Food is great! We ordered their bombdiggity bag and the prawns are big! The portion is really good for 4 people. Staff are friendly and attentive too.
Great food,"Great food and concept! Love the taste of the food! The bomb something bag was great! Paired with their garlic butter sauce. Haddock Fish and Chip was also very good! The only thing was our free lobster was a little scary when we open it up .. it was full of this black gooey thing but was told it was normal, could have been a better experience if they were to pre-warn us or just leave us with the lobster tail and claw which is the only thing edible, this would have saved us the experience of popping the shell to all the black and gooey things dripping onto my other food. Other than that great service from the staff!"
Restaurant that can't help themselves,"My gf has a seafood diet so I've no choice but to choose a nice seafood lunch place. Chance upon The Boiler at google. Location is easy as it is right next to Taxi stand of The Esplanade Mall. It was quiet and I'm the first customer at 12pm. Once seated the polite waiter went away and stand at the bar counter. Not interested to ask if I need any drinks. I've to call out for him and ask if he can be kind enough to offer me some water while I wait for my friends and also good chance to remove my mask?

Strike 1 - No Mam! We don't serve water, pls order our bottled water. Ok I did.
I saw they'd strong wifi signal, asked for the password. Strike 2 - No Mam! We don't give out our password to our customers. I feel like having a glass of wine while waiting, asked waiter which menu show the wine by the glass? Strike 3 - No Mam! Due to CoVid, we don't serve wine by the glass. Pls order by the bottle. Just happen the friends I'm meeting at Boiler doesn't drink at all. I told him I can't possibly finish 1 bottle by my own, can they be more flexible? Answer: Not possible.

We ordered the Specialty 189++ for 3-4 pax which is plenty to go around.
Seafood was good and fresh. I wouldn't have the sauce on top of the fries which make it all soggy.

3 of us bill comes to SGD 233.40 for the special promo menu and 3 drinks. Would I go back again? I think Jumbo seafood resto suits me just fine and I can do less with the fried food."
Dining at The Boiler,I have been dinning at The Boiler for more than 5 times. Their seafood quality always very fresh and never disappoint us at all. I also like to complement their staff for being so helpful and cheerful when they serve their customers. Will definitely come back again.
Freshness guaranteed,Good service and seafood was definitely fresh and delicious. Ordered ice lemon tea which I believe was bottomless but there was no refill throughout...over $110 for 2pax....so may be slightly overpriced for the quantity given.
"Great food, good service!",Staff were polite and attentive to every customer. Food was delicious as well!! Chose the duo set with mild spice level and it's perfect for me (low spice tolerance lol). Will be back again!
Quality & Taste Never Disappoints,"We had our usual, the Bombdiggity Bag which did not disappoint! This by far is the best chili crab we have had (and consistently has had) in Singapore! The service this time however, was not what we experienced in the past."
Super nice,Super nice taste !! Definitely will go back again ! Garlic butter and work taste super good please try both
Awesome Seafood in a bag!,Overall the food is Superb! One of a kind meal if you want to feast on seafood! The sauce is divine and CRAB and SHRIMP are fresh!
Service & food,"I have ordered ala carte, not too sure is it frozen frozen food but the ribs is good. Most of the diners ordered the seafood in the bag. However, the service team also forgotten 1 of our order."
Good service and good food at reasonable prices,"This is my first time here. The western style of chilli crab is a bit different from what i am normally used to, but overall experience was good as the seafood was fresh and the staff were attentive. Prices too were reasonable. Will come again with more people so we can try more dishes."
Prawns was very fresh & succulent. Staff were attentive,"The staffs were really attentive and their service was very good. The food ordered was fresh and tasty. The prawns were particularly fresh and succulent. If it‚Äôs your birthday month, they will give you a free $75 lobster and a small birthday cake."
"Fresh seafood, yummy!","fresh seafood (crab, prawns, etc). standard fish n chips was good too. love the free flow iced lemon tea as well."
Birthday lunch,One of the best services I have encountered. The staff (Kayson and team) was extremely helpful and the seafood was fresh!
awesome,food and services are so great. Staff are so nice and friendly. I want to honback again and try some other dishes..
Good seafood,"Went there for lunch on my birthday! Seafood tasted fresh and great, except that the lobster was a bit too chewy. Bombdiggity bag was quite enough for 3 adults."
A great place for a seafood meal with a twist,Had my birthday celebration and was given a full Boston lobster as a free treat from the restaurant with the purchase of one of their signature bag. The food was fresh and flavorful and the staff were very attentive.
Eat and go !,"The food is great, service is quick and staff is friendly. The only reason I gave one less star is that they only have 2 hrs slots and sharp 2 hours later they ask you to leave ! Not a place to sit and relax with friends ... simply eat and get out !"
Great food & service,"Seafood was fresh and 'the works' is a great sauce that goes well with the seafood bag. The only downside was white rice wasn't really good and 1 small additional piece of corn cost $1.50, wasn't aware when i asked for top up but overall it was sweet & juicy. Great gesture by The Boiler to present a complimentary cake for celebrating a birthday."
Excellent service and food,"We went there on a Monday night to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday. The service by Andrina was amazing, top-notch. She was friendly, recommended great dishes and combination. Refilling of drinks were prompt and food served fast. She even gave us a complimentary cake and was waiting for us to go back to the table before serving it! Amazing service from her. The food was great (the prawns were very fresh) and the service is impeccable. Thank You, Andrina."
Fantastic meal and serviceüôåüèª,"Generous serving of seafood and Kris together with others gave service very well,even played a birthday song, awesome! overall it was a fantastic experience. Thank you Boilers!"
Boiler,Food is good especially fish m chips. Atmosphere a bit not good enough. Hope can improve. Seafood pricing a bit expensive based on the portion.
Noice,"Very nice atmosphere, super fun to eat especially if you love seafood. Highly recommend this place!!"
Birthday boy is happy!,Birthday surprise during covid. Take-away delivery format of seafood in a bag works well. Crab and lobster very fresh and well cooked. Generous portions.
bag of seafood goodies,"their signature dish is the bombigitty bag of mixed seafood with your choice of sauce..a free lobster for birthday as a promo, tasty ala carte dishes topped with bottomless iced tea is all we need for a hearty flavorful meal"
Fresh delicious seafood,The Sri Lankan crab was fresh and was well prepared. The seafood bag for 2 had a good portion of various seafood. Knowledge of service staffs could be improved.
Lunch date with Seafood,"Was here for lunch on a weekday, atmosphere was nice and quiet. Seafood tasted fresh and delicious, had it with the garlic butter sauce which my partner enjoyed. Additionally service staffs were attentive and quick, made dining there enjoyable."
Dining at the Boiler,Nice experience. Guess the restaurant need not stress to customers on the 90-min dining duration as this really kinda spoil the impression....We spent about an hour at the restaurant. The spread was not in proportion though. Eg. plenty of clams and few prawns...
Nice Ambience,It is great place to enjoy pretty affordable and tasty crabs and lobster. Wait Staff was attentive too.
Yum yum,We had a very satisfying meal right after our golf game. Seafood were very fresh and yummy paired with their unique sauces. Service were attentive too.
Nice Food,"Nice food, good service, good environment and affordable price. Fresh seafood. Will come again to try their lobster."
Duration for meal,There‚Äôs an allocation of only 1.5 hours for the meal and it should been flag out earlier. Felt like I was in a rush to eat even though their food is great.
Good Food! Good Mood!,Food is fresh and delicious. Service is superb. Ambiance is awesome. Will definitely go back and recommend to friends. :)
Get down and dirty,"If you like to get your hands dirty while satisfying your craving for some good ol' seafood, The Boiler will hit the spot. Three of us ladies shared the Bombdiggity Bag plus a Boston Lobster and we polished it clean.My only grip was that there wasn't any squid in the mix. The garlic butter is ok but best had with their signature sauce IMHO."
Rush dining experience,"Rush dining experience, inform at the last min upon seated that dining only applicable for 90 mins. Throughout was rushed thrgout by the restaurant."
Delicious seafood experience!,"This seafood dining experience is unique and delicious. Diners can choose a variety of different seafood bags that are boiled with your preference of sauce. You are given gloves to eat the meal, so there is no worry about eating politely... the entire dinner is messy but delicious. We have the chocolate lava cake and ice cream for dessert. As a sweet lover, the dessert was to die for!"
Satisfied seafoods lover here!,Thank you to The Boiler Esplanade team especially to Kuya Danny who is very attentive to our dining needs. The complimentary birthday cake and song is a nicest touch to end the meal. Recommended for mukbang and seafood lovers out there. Freshest seafoods await you
Enjoy the food and ice cream üç¶,First time dining here and loved the seafood bag. The pasta was also good with good portion for the price. Loved their lava cake and salted caramel ice cream. The combination was superb which we never tried before.
Poor quality,"The crab quality is bad... a lot of stuff on the menu was not available
But wasn‚Äôt informed upfront
We made efforts to choose what we want only to be informed after we choose that the items are not available
And it‚Äôs not 1 or 2, probably 10 items only 2 are available ..."
The food is very good,I strongly recommend to go for your birthday or during birthday month. They have free lobster promotion for your birthday.
Food,"The freshness of the seafood and sauce makes the dish all worthwhile visiting The Boiler for the third time! Much thought given to diners, providing ample coverage even to our phones!"
Have been here for seafood few times,"Seafood is fresh. Crab was big & meaty. Free lobster due to birthday month & it was also meaty. Prawns are fresh, big & juicy. Will recommend to seafood lovers"
Description of offer was not clear,"Food was decent good, but the description of the promotion offer was not clear. It does not include crab and mussels! I ordered a cake to deliver the restaurant and the staff didn't inform me that they have received the cake early. I was in a panic contacting the bakery shop for not showing up with cake at the stated time."
One of the unique dining experience to try in Singapore,Birthday meal with lobster and Sri Lankan crab in great spicy sauces and lovely white wine to go with it. Something different and local (Sri Lankan crab - Giant!) and great fun eating with hands (gloves and gear provided too for your mobile phone!)
The boiler for birthday celebration,"We came at 12pm and was served fast. They have plastic covers for your hands, phone and clothes which is great! Their portion is large and great for sharing."
Awesome food and excellent service!,"Visited the outlet at Howard road and was impressed with the freshness of the seafood and the value . Ordered the boomdiggty set and it came with free Boston lobster as we had a birthday boy amongst us. The seafood was very fresh , and the sauce really brought out the natural sweetness of the ingredients.

Mervin was serving us , and he was very attentive and patient with all our questions as it was our first visit. At the end of our meal, they even provided a free slice of cake with a candle for the birthday boy.. wow totally unexpected!

We would highly recommend this place for good seafood and excellent service !"
