"pretentious, mediocre and overpriced","$100 per person minimum for a tiny, mediocre burger and cold fries that came 1/2 hour after the food. Being ""cool"" does not negate the need for basic service and value for money. I'd stay away."
Epic,"Amazing building, amazing food, amazing staff. The burgers are the best in Singapore, especially the truffle one. Cocktails and roof top area are epic. Super cool place."
Cool place üòé must visit!,"Cool place for drinks. Got a table on their rooftop bar facing the not so appealing view. But it‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs given since we don‚Äôt have a reservation and it‚Äôs only for a quick drink. Still can see the lovely sky and just walk around to check out some good spots. And speaking of drinks, we enjoyed it, with great tunes and good staff. By the way, heads-up for the ladies wearing heels, be prepared to climb 4 stories of steps as they don‚Äôt have lift."
Very cool bar..must check out.,"Very cool atmosphere. Unique drink menu with small bite food menu. Try the ‚ÄúNew Fashioned‚Äù and the ‚ÄúMissionary Style‚Äù drinks‚Ä¶both very good. Bartenders are friendly and helpful, as are the waitresses."
Pricey drinks filled with ice only,"We went here on a Monday..and to our surprise it was quite busy..the staff is friendly and quick.
We ordered cocktails-all r very tasty ,but where is the alcohol?plus it is so filled with ice..you will finish in 3-4 sips.
Priced at almost $25 which is on a higher side as compare to any high end bar/pubs here.
Nachos were below average.
Cheese fries were ok and hot
Veg sliders were yummy..
On an average-it couldn‚Äôt give u the experience like it‚Äôs brand name which I had experience in Bali.

The restaurant must work on its bar..to make the drinks more worthy."
Over priced over hyped,"Was here with my partner on a Sunday for our date night. We've heard so much good things about Potato Head Singapore, but when we were there on Sunday, there was honestly a huge gap in the service.
The roof top service was the worse. Take my advice, if you'd like to go there, head to level 2 or 3 (for great drinks). My partner actually thought he booked for the roof top and was told that they had a full house situation over the phone. It was EMPTY when we arrived at 7pm.

Upon arrival, there was a male and female staff. The male staff help us locate our reservation and ask us to head up to level 2. The other lady staff who saw us, seemed like she was having a terrible day and rolled her eyes at us before continuing her conversation with her colleague.

2nd floor was simply amazing, great ambiance! The staff immediately received us and got us seated. She even explained the menu and the current specials (food and drinks) patiently when we asked her for recommendations. After ordering our food, we checked with one of the staff if by any chance there's a seat for us at the roof, or if it was not possible due to the rain? They kindly checked and told us that there was space and shelter, and would be more glad to help transfer us upstairs. We settled our bill and they sent our drinks and redirected our food up.

The bad service started when we got seated at the roof. Sadly, due to the rain, the awning was opened and we couldn't see much from the roof. My chair was wet when I sat down and had to clean my own chair with a tissue. Staff saw, but just walked away. He even saw that the bar stools that we sat on was extremely unstable, but offered no assistance to stuff paper or switch a chair. Table obviously had residue from the previous patrons, but was it too dark that the staff couldn't see and didn't clean it up? Again, I had to use my own tissue to clean it, as it was quite a huge patch and was sticky.

One thing I must commend this place is that they serve tap water to all guests, I really appreciated that! Our food and cocktails were served shortly. My partner had a Fun Three Boy burger and a French Romance cocktail, I had the Honky Tonk and a Royal Gin and Juice. The cocktails were tasty and refreshing but extremely small and over priced. I mean $20+ per glass, and smaller than a champagne glass? Fun Three Boy was really delicious, but if you prefer no beef, I'd suggest to not even order Honky Tonk. It was disappointing, tasted confusing, and was overall not pleasant at all.

Hopefully if I do ever return, it'll be a better experience and I'd DEFINITELY avoid the rooftop at all costs."
Standard has plummeted,"Burgers are still great but everything else was super disappointing. Smaller portions, fries swimming in fat and even the cocktails were served in smaller glasses with huge amounts of ice. Sadly don‚Äôt think we will come back again"
"Overpriced, overrated","Ordered from the takeaway window. Waited for nearly 30 minutes and was it a pretty mediocre burger. Then they want to charge $7 for a can of coke lol... go to shake shack across the street, you‚Äôll thank yourself."
BAD SERVICE.,"DO NOT RECOMMEND. especially if you are looking to dine at the rooftop, because when it rains no one will provide you with any solutions except to giggle and laugh at you being drenched :-)

Extremely appalled by the service from the manager (a malay long hair lady with glasses). We were sitting at the rooftop and it started raining. Everyone was looking at the service crews hoping that they will be opening up the umbrella but they didn't. So my friends approached the lady and asked if they could open up the umbrella.

the FIRST reaction from her was that she laughed and said ""it's not gonna reach you anyway"" and walked off without opening up the umbrella.

????

Yes, the umbrella might not reached us but you could have provided us with more solutions instead of laughing at us and smirking and saying that it's just a passing cloud. FYI IT RAINED HEAVILY THE ENTIRE NIGHT.

A simple solution could be- ""you could move your tables in a little/ we can shift you to the bar area but you have to be standing, is it ok?"" etc but nope, none of all these solutions.

She and her staffs just stood there watching all of us get caught in the rain???????? honestly appalled by this service.

p/S an indian guy named viran(?) was nice enough to provide us with solution after awhile and shifted us to another rooftop table near the bar area.

pps/ most of their service crews have attitude issues like showing black face when you ask for more items/ or getting in their way."
What an expensive waste of an evening,"Just a complete horror show.....This place should go under.

Where to begin:

I made this reservation 3 weeks in advance due to Saturdays being busy. We have been frequenting for years and my family always enjoyed the funky environment.

Reservation made for 5 pax at 7pm. As they sit you they warn you that the table reservation is only good for 2 hours. We were not given water until 7:30 and our orders were taken at 7:45pm. That is a 45 minute wait. Unacceptable.

They have changed the menu with far fewer selections and have removed the children's options. Cheapest burger is 18 SGD, and this comes bare with no sides. A soft drink is 6-7 sgd. Forget about a 20+ SGD cocktail. We are taking a burger joint here folks. This is *not* a fancy place by any means.

My family ordered 4 burgers, no sides, water. I ordered a 14 SGD plate of broccoli instead of a burger. MY wife got a 6sgd oce tea

At approximately 8:30, the burgers arrive, OK... looks like we are running out of time.....but wait, where is my order? And wait, where is my wife's 6 SGD ice tea?

Never showed up. They then had the temerity to try and bum rush us out the place because the 2 hour time limit was coming up and presented us a bill with the missing items, PLUS A 10% SERVICE CHARGE !!!

Well, giving patrons 30 min to ""enjoy: an grossly overpriced meal while forgetting the bill payer's order is surely not a recipe for success nor a repeat visit.

The bill was reduced to remove the un served items, but they steadfastly refused to remove the service charge. I'm with my family, so not looking to make a big deal, but there is no way I am going back to this place.

I welcome their management to contact me to discuss. My reservation was for 5 at 19:00 on 20 MAR. You can find me."
Not Impressed,"After waiting 3 weeks to get a reservation, we went and waited almost 30 min to order (after being told we had a 2 hour limit to stay) ordered and 4 $25 burgers, a side and drinks. We only got the burgers. The side and drinks never came. That's ok because I don't want to pay $7 for a coke. The burgers didn't come with a side, no fries, no salad, nothing just a $25 burger that wasn't special.The menu seemed to have been reduced so not as many options. Not once did anyone come back to our table to check if we needed anything. They weren't even crazy busy. Bottom line food was Meh, service was bad, prices do not justify the quality or service. We have been there 5 or 6 times and will not go back. Just not worth it."
Great food! Great staff! Amazing place,Staff were very helpful and quick with our order and requests. Juvel helped us with everything! We will definitely go back! üëåüèª
"Mean cocktails, so-so eats.","Cult-status achieved Potato Head needs little introduction. Scaled-down in Singapore, it still attracts those who desire to be seen. It‚Äôs got that Bali-cool badge of honour with wall graffiti‚Äôs and verve of anti-establishment. They still make mean beautiful cocktails but 2 buns eatery on the second floor are over-priced and food are decent but hardly knockout despite the creative names. In our 2.5 hours seat, the crowds are vastly different and un-homogenous."
Nice Cocktail,"We couldn't get a table on the rooftop, but the indoor seat's ambiance is great as well. Smoking boy's burger, truffle fries and Winner winner are highly recommended! (Especially Winner winner is so addictive!) Their cocktails are nice and strong too!"
Delicious burgers! But the presentation surprised me...,"Had heard a lot about the famous Potato Head in Bali, which I'd never visited. Since there's one in Singapore, I figured why not, and visited them for lunch on a weekday.

This being a period of the Covid-19 pandemic, I was definitely very pleased and grateful when the staff immediately served me a glass of iced water without me asking -- as that would give me a legitimate reason to remove my mask.

Love the old-school vibe in this place; after all it IS housed in one of Singapore's most iconic historical buildings.

I had what I consider the most decadent burger on their menu, which is the Truff Ryder. What with truffle and beef and foie gras, this was absolutely delicious and I very much enjoyed it. Only thing was that I was quite surprised at the way it was served -- basically it's as tough you're just taking-away at a fast food chain, complete with the wrapping paper, except they put it on a simple plate for you.

I mean, maybe this is a ""trademark"" move, but I really at least expected the burger to be served UN-wrapped since I'm dining in, and maybe with a little more effort to presentation? But nada, it's like getting a burger-to-go on a little square plate, and tada, that's your dine-in presentation.

Still, I would go again, for the delicious burgers. Price is definitely on the higher-end, so maybe a once-in-a-while visit will do."
Overpriced,"Tried to book table on roof top terrace - but apparently they dont take reservations on terrace... So we got on the waiting list - but never got a table.
That said - the bill said 137 dollars for 2 burgers, 1 fries, 1 (small) glass of wine and a coctail.

137 dollars!!

Pretty good burgers - but fries way too greasy. Restaurant relatively ‚Äúhip‚Äù - but then again... ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

All in all: decent food - but super overpriced!! Tons of better places in SG!"
Best service ever,"Awesome evening. May was perfect, the service is awesome, the drinks are wonderful, I'm gonna be there every week!!"
"Yeh, nice.","Good vibe on the rooftop. Tasty cocktails, nice view (not hard to come by in Singapore), friendly staff and tasty burgers. Would go again, maybe just after payday."
"Go if you want to pay extra for the ""brand""","This was my second time at Potato Head Singapore and the first dining inside (the previous one was at the rooftop). Two totally different experiences.
Burgers are good, don't get me wrong, but they come in such small sizes and with such a big price tag... The watered down cocktails don't help either.
There are definitely other places in town where you can have 4 burgers as good as there and not have to pay 100 dollars for them (if you do, they'll come way bigger and/or with sides).
Unless they shrank their sandwiches between the two times I was there, the only thing I can think of is that the rooftop ambience made such an impact as to make the experience worthwhile and forget about the sizes. Down the floors? Not that great."
Overrated place.,"Brought my family for dinner. Made a booking as understand that place is pack. We ordered 4 different kinds of burgers, size is reasonable but too costly not worth it. The decoration inside has no theme just messy. Rooftop is small area to chill and drink."
One time visit,"We visited on a Sunday, for brunch around 1 pm. The place is good, we were hoping to get a seat at the rooftop which I did mention when making my reservation online. But nowhere it mentioned that the rooftop opens at 5 pm only. I think my experience would've been better if we were seated at the rooftop.
Anyway, the burgers were good, the patty was really flavourful, but it doesn't come with any sides like fries, or something, so it is not value for money. The cocktails are good only if you don't like to taste the alcohol in your cocktail.
We ended by having a tequila shot, and I accidentally spilled mine, when I requested for another one, they charged me for that too (this was quite expected as the whole place seemed to be only open to earn money and not make a relationship with a guest). Nobody spills their drinks intentionally!!
Service is quite good and fast! SO basically I will never come here again."
Yummy burger!,"Read about the reviews and saw that it was on Shopbackgo with 35% cashback (for a limited time), so decided to come and try. And love how the whole place looked! Everywhere is Instagrammable! The atmosphere is very chill and it was good service too. Ordered a burger and broccoli as the sides and it was really yummy! (although the price is a little on the high end for certain burgers)
Overall, I would say a nice place to chill out.
And thanks for taking the extra precautions with the sanitizer and temperature taking at this moment in time. (and the 1m distance)"
best french fries and beatifull place,"Nice place to chill.. Approachable staff and smily on sundy afternoon visit .. Plating of menu was presentable... We been here as we saw in google, one of the most instagramable restaurant in Sg.. Small but famous building."
Fantastic spot - Favourite of ours,"Always a great time here - we never book and always seem to be accommodated by the great staff.

Food is cool - fresh and tasty and no excessively priced which is refreshing on this street.

Bring friends for a balmy rooftop experience - sipping icy cold drinks, cool vibes, retro disco music.

Staff are great too -seem to all love their jobs!

HIGHLY RECCOMEND."
Burger and beer at a small and nice roof-top bar,"3 floors of different type of bars to have a drink or something to eat leading up to the roof top bar.
Here you can enjoy the breeze, have some appetizers and drinks, or as well eat from the main menu.
We had some cold beers, a really nice cheese burger and very nice fries.
Enjoyed it and will come back again."
Restaurant with a stuck-up attitude,"No doubt it's lovely to sit on the roof top of this establishment with a group of friends on a breezy, over-cast day or after sun-down, but I've never had a more stuck-up reception from a place in Singapore. Before we even got to the place, we got a message saying we would have to vacate after 2 hours. WTF! On a Monday evening? During all this virus scare? Are you kidding me? This place (and some of it's staff) is pretentious and I will never go back. Not to mention, most of its food is WAY over-priced. The food is well made and tastes great, but too expensive for what you get."
Great night out with friends,What a great bar with a great atmosphere . Especially the roof top . Was a great night out and totally recommend. Go it‚Äôs really worth it .
Great roof to have a drink and enjoy the view,"This is a nice place to explore in Singapore. As is the case with most places at Keong Saik Rd, drinks are expensive. However, the staff is great and food bites are good. Do try the ‚Äúnaughty fries‚Äù!!"
Bad service,"Made a reservation for a visit and spoke to staff on the phone prior to visit, but was only informed upon arrival that we would only have our table for 2 hours and was not told that beforehand. When we said that we were not informed of this and we might want to stay longer and asked if there might be other seats available, one server said he would seat us at the bar after 2 hours, to which we agreed. After 2 hours however, another server came over and made us settle the bill. When we asked if we could move to the bar then and told her that the first server had offered us as such, she just glared at us and said very rudely ""there's people at the bar"" and kicked us out saying she needed the table and wanted us to settle the bill and leave when we were still eating and drinking and had not finished our meal. She made no attempt to help resolve this or check with her colleague, she just stood there trying to chase us away and glared at us impatiently and kept snapping ""there's people there's people"".

The food was nice and the decor was great, but 1) the time limit should've been communicated upfront and beforehand so we could make an informed decision and as it was it put a damper on our plans; 2) it is not nice to promise customers to seat them elsewhere but then later renegade on their word and then just kick customers out and 3) if you absolutely had to have customers leave, surely it could've been communicated in a better and not belligerent way and this was just bad treatment of customers."
Roof bar for drinks and music,Nice afterwork in Chinatown. restaurant and bar over the 3 level of the building + roof top. Lot of cocktail and nice music on the top.
Went for team lunch - amazing experience !,"Being a vegan - mock food helps me explore new food types . Lol This place is good and has amazing food. Fries are too addictive, please try to resist impossible burger is fabulous. Must visit"
Burgers to leave home for!,"This has it all, roof top bar and excellent food. I had a burger and it‚Äôs right up there as being tasty, very well cooked and happily could‚Äôve eaten it again!!
Staff are attentive without being pushy, service was great.
Well worth a visit in an area of the city that is packed with choice."
Excellent,"Had dinner at Burnt ends then over the road to potato head. Roof TOP 4th floor is the best location, excellent service and view, loved it"
"Ok drinks, incompetent service","Drinks are OK but a bit watery, but the service is laughable. Every server would ask the same question, often within seconds of each other. After they asked us to move tables, it took not one but four servers to figure out the check, including asking us what we had. In total it took 20 minutes to get the check.

Clearly no experienced manager working on Sunday nights, even though the rooftop is still mostly full. Pass"
Overpriced and not worth a visit,"We paid $114 Australian dollars for two burgers with chips, two beers and two cocktails (happy hour price!!!!). I asked the hostess on the ground floor if they used Australian beef and she had no idea!!!
The burgers were tasty but TINY and wrapped in paper, they were also extremely rare which surprised us. The chips which you pay extra for - all ten of them were under cooked, and no napkins were provided.
We sat on the rooftop terrace in the early evening. Watch out for the 7% tax and 10% service charge on top of your bill.
I would not recommend a visit to this place to anyone, and I apologies to my husband for bringing him here it was a big mistake."
A bottle for two,We had a great enjoyable time at potato head. The bar is at the top of the building so. Located in the hype area as we do morning to evening chill. Definitely a come back list if we stay around keong saik.
Rooftop bar,"We stumbled upon here by accident and were glad we did. We enjoyed the rooftop bar so much that we came back a second evening. First night we shared a bucket of beers and had some miso dirty fries. Second night we came after dinner and tried some of their cocktails, really nice. Staff were friendly, and the rooftop had a fun and relaxed atmosphere to it. Great place to enjoy late night drinks and views."
Great hangout with rooftop bar,"Potato Head on the ground and first floors serves awesome burgers. The veggie options aren‚Äôt that great and would be good if they branched out a little more and improved ok this area.

Second floor has a ‚Äúhidden‚Äù speakeasy style bar with loud music. The rooftop has a gorgeous bar with strings of fairy lights and nice views. A great hangout in the evenings especially weekends."
Amazing food,"We had a great meal here, the staff were friendly and really good. The burgers was reasonably priced and absolutely delicious, would definitely recommend a visit."
Rooftop Bar,"We didn't come here for food, just drinks at the rooftop bar. Stairs were wide but there were a few of them. Roof has nice feel to it, small tables and a small standing area. Great on a cool evening. Cocktails were great."
Beautiful burger spot in Chinatown,This amazing burger restaurant is situated on the edge of chinatown and offers many different ambiences on the several floors. We enjoyed two fantastic burgers on the rooftop beneath the bar with an impressive view on parts of both chinatown and downtown.
Excellent burgers with Impossible options,Potato Head is one of the few F&B outlets in Singapore that offers Impossible meat and it‚Äôs version of the Impossible cheese burger is great. I would be hard pressed to tell the difference between Impossible and beef!
A little over hyped?,"Definitely a groovy, hipster vibe with interesting interior design. Menu was ok but nothing spectacular, service was friendly enough as long as we could be fitted in to an hour slot as the tables were reserved. All of which was Ok but just left feeling underwhelmed by the food quality, portion size and cost."
Great food and drinks pity for poor service,"Impossible burgers were hardly warm and the fries arrived 10 mins later well after we had finished the burgers.
Fries eventually offered in addition to one complimentary desert: chocolate mousse (no choice).
It did not make it this time"
Decent burger..patchy service,"Visited for dinner. We didn‚Äôt have a booking and the lady at the counter said we could have a table for an hour.

When we did get the table though, service was quite slow and patchy.

The regular burger was good but the impossible burger was very disappointing- very dry. Don‚Äôt know it it was their fault or just that I don‚Äôt like the impossible burger but giving them the benefit of the doubt."
Impossible Burger My dream come true,"House in a heritage building in China town, the ambience is charming and quien. It has Three Buns on the first floor, Studio 1939 on 3rd floor, a sophisticated drinking den plus a rooftop bar. We came here to try the impossible burger, and left with great satisfaction. Although the price is on the high side. The impossible dream is S$27++ no sides. Per head is about S$55. We had drinks, fries, beef chilli, and dessert Brookie Busta to share. Overall we had a great time. Serving is fast and attentive. Food taste delicious. Definitely a come again."
Impossible Burger,"Great that Potato Head is selling the Impossible Burger. BUT! They cook it on the same hot plate as the beef burger patties!!! Seriously?!

AND. How about offering a truly Vegan burger. With vegan cheese, vegan mayo & burger buns."
Never got to even try the food,"Wanted a burger at 8pm and was on my own, Was told by the 2 Customer Service Executives at the entrance they were full and could only seat me in the cocktail bar, I said ok but when I walked up there found the restaurant level was half empty and the cocktail bar was too dark and noisy

They told me they had reservations for 730 and 8pm and couldn't accommodate me - this was at 8pm! Maybe alot of no shows or not interested in serving individuals? And even the stools against the windows are reserved?? What the ??

Walked away and saw a long line of empty tables outside, went back and asked why I couldnt sit there and they said I could but need to order at cashier

What the ??? She couldnt have mentioned that before I started to leave disappointed??

Worst customer service ever"
Another place where non-meat eaters can chill and pose,"Tried both ""meat from plants"" Impossible Dream and Chedda burgers, and they were absolutely fab! Even my carniv son gave two thumbs up! A great place to hang and give Earth a break - save some cows."
It's Impossible,"Went to this place in quest to try the Impossible Burger and they were one of very few places in Singapore serving them. Not knowing what to expect, the eatery turns out to be in a charming old corner building in the now quite hipster, vibrant historic Keong Saik area. While the kitchen is on the ground floor, with some small tables al-fresco at the pavement, the actual restaurant is on the 2nd floor, vividly decorated and cozy. The Impossible Burger were not a disappointment and grilled to perfection.
Service and ambience was great - will surely come back to try out the non-vegan burgers.
(And yes, it's not the cheapest burger in town, but hey, it's not a fast food joint!)"
Great food great ambience!,"Totally enjoyed our burgers. We had a honky tonk, baby huey and Fun Boy three which were delicious! Their fries were crispy still despite being left out for a while. It's a great ambience to catch up with friends as well! Make sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment!"
Try the rooftopbar,Fancy multilevel restaurant bar. At every floor a different offering. Quite hype. It‚Äôs an old building (rarity in Singapore!). The rooftop bar is offering a nice view and during the weekend it‚Äôs a lot of fun. Many expats and locals. Cocktails list is not bad and the staff is kind. Worth a few drinks on a Friday night!
"Every level, difference experience",Every floor has different vibes and themes and would recommend you to reserve to secure a spot during the weekends. The Impossible burgers are fantastic but could be steep if you have a full set of meal including cocktails.
Great service great food,"Must visit, good service, good food and good cocktails. What more is there to ask for. This place was very Instagramable if that's your thing too. Friendly and warm was the feeling I got the moment we stepped in."
Cute place but expensive,"This is certainly an adorable and interesting hipster spot. And they have several vegetarian ‚Äúburgers‚Äù which is fantastic. Fun atmosphere and things to look at on the walls while dining. However, I just paid 27.00 SGD for a single vegetarian burger which came with no sides. The fries were an additional 14 SGD! I understand that Singapore is an insanely expensive city. However 27$ for a veg burger with no sides seems a bit extreme and like they‚Äôre certainly taking advatage of the cute factor of this place. Fries were great! Burger was honestly just an average veg burger."
"Nice bar, but felt pressured to pay","We heard that there was a Potato Head in Singapore, so we were quite keen to try out their rooftop bar (you'll have to walk a few flights of stairs).
Nice music and fairy lights, though as some reviews have mentioned, it is a bit dark so we had to squint to look at the menu.

Staff seemed a little cold - no smiles apart from the lady at the door. After ordering, they gave us the bill straight away... Which put us off ordering anything else. It felt like they thought we were going to run off when we just wanted to sit down and relax with a few drinks. Server must have seen our face as she then asked whether we wanted to open a tab, but the mood was gone.

Didn't try the food, but it is a nice spot near Outram Park MRT - just hope service improves. Drinks were fine."
Great burger,"We stepped in for a quick lunch. Great burger (greasy in the perfect way!) and corn fries. The atmosphere was hipster-ish, the service was fine but it was quite expensive compared to other places in Singapore."
"Terrible Service, Avoid this Place","We arrived at the rooftop patio and were greeted by a server who told us to sit where ever we wanted. They gave us menus and walked away. About 12 minutes later, we were ready to order and noticed the whole service team was just hanging out around the bar tasting cocktails and chatting with each other, no one looked our way or noticed us.

We work in the service industry so we understood how it goes sometimes, but nobody came for another little while so after 18-20 minutes we left. And still nobody really noticed us or cared.

Theres so many places to go in the area, pick somewhere else!"
Dimly lit cocktail bar with ambience that serves burgers,"Be prepared to climb about four flights of narrow stairs to the very dimly lit cocktail bar. The cocktail bar exudes ambience, however it is very dark and difficult to see the menu. In saying that, both the burgers and the wine selection are good, and would recommend a night out to Potato Head."
Great Burgers and frieendly atmosphere,"Situated smack in the down town area Potato Head Singapore has managed to copy the Bali success and maintained the vibe, ambience, friendly staff and most important great burgers. Not a place for a fancy dinner but a great place to hang out over burgers and beers/wine/drinks with friends and family . . .try the rooftop servings. . . not too many of those opportunities around in the down town area."
Disappointing,"Heard a lot about this place, so we made the effort to go for a quick evening meal whilst in Chinatown. Seated quickly as was pretty empty and then nearly fell off my chair with the price of beer. SGD17 for a 330ml pilsner....! There were no cheaper options, all beers were 330ml and the same price. I ordered one any way as wanted to see if it came in a gold stubby holder or something, it didn‚Äôt! Ordered food and it came very quickly, the wife had The Dogg, which was pretty good apparently, and I had the Burning Man burger. Chips (a dozen of them) were an extra SGD3 each. Food came out in a plastic basket with grease proof paper on a wooden board thingy! Portion size was adequate, but did not reflect the price! My burger was supposed to be hot chilli, but it was quite mild for my taste but I love chilli and have become somewhat immune to the burn now. Just a fork was available on the table, so for them cleaning up would be a breeze. If you‚Äôre going to serve food and expect guests to eat with their hands, at least supply a finger/wet wipes, after the meal, it‚Äôs not a McDonald‚Äôs! Overall, I was disappointed with the experience and would not recommend this as somewhere to go on a night out. Other areas of the restaurant maybe better, but unlikely to be any cheaper. If your on a budget, avoid it, if you can park your Lamborghini out front, then spend as much time as you like there."
Delicious,"The food was delicious. The fried chicken burger was my favorite. As well as the beet and butternut squash salad & truffle fries. The Rambo burger was also so tasty. The ‚Äúketchup‚Äù that comes with the regular fries is the best I‚Äôve ever tasted. It definitely has one or two different ingredientes that makes the flavor really stand out. Amazing!
The baked cookie dessert was awesome. The environment is also really cute and eclectic. I loved the charm of the place. The one thing that could‚Äôve been slightly better was the service. One staff member was very kind and welcoming but all the others seemed less than willing to answer questions regarding the menu or simply just to engage with the customer. All in all the food was great and it was a good experience."
Rooftop bar has a nice vibe,"The rooftop bar here has a really nice vibe and the service is excellent. Do note that it's a bit small and they don't take reservations for the rooftop bar, so you may have to wait a bit for a table.

Cocktails were a hit and miss (some excellent and some so so) and prices were OK. But the beer and wine are definitely overpriced.

We tried the Roots burger which was just about average.

I wouldn't go back for a long night out or a dinner. But this definitely a nice place for a quick night cap."
Just about okay...,"Went to Potato Head on a Sunday evening. Wanted to get a couple of drinks and then get some dinner at 3 Buns, their burger joint. Reached around 8 pm but they had only standing room at their roof top bar so went to their other bar on the 3rd level - very average experience. Paid $18 for a so called Old fashioned - glenmorangie with a twist of lime and soda came as a small shot of glenmorangie with water and some lime juice. Dinner in the restaurant was just about okay in terms of value for money.. For the price we paid ($21-23) for each burger we would have expected slightly bigger sizes. They don‚Äôt come with fries either so those had to be ordered separately. I ordered the Rambo which has a lamb patty - tough meat, could have been better. Having said that my wife‚Äôs hot dog and sons beef burger were good but again kind of measly in size for the price you paid. Service was good - very attentive and helpful server. However, will think twice before going back again..."
Fun rooftop bar,"Fun place with great rooftop bar, and seems to be a very popular place. Unfortunately had a short visit, but love to go back."
Calling all burger lovers,"I have been to Potato head on numerous occasions and it never disappoints. The burgers are not your average burger but they always deliver in great (sometimes unique) flavour.
Honestly, the service has not always been 100% on point but the food has always been great so we have forgiven them.

Having visited most of Singapores burger joints, potato head remains a firm favourite.
I also love the quirky restaurant setting and roof terrace.

Definitely worth a visit and will satisfy any burger cravings!"
Overrated burger,I came here mainly for the burger which I found to be below average and is overrated. Very basic decor. I believe people come here for the cocktails and rooftop bar. Service was excellent.
Average,"I happened to be in the area and stopped by for a quick meal. I'd heard a lot about the place so perhaps my expectations were hightened.

The decor of this place is tacky at best.

I decided to go in for a burger. It arrived quickly and was done to my request. Unfortunately, it was completely mediocre.

Thankfully, the service was decent.

I couldn't see what the hype has been about and I wouldn't go here again."
Excellent Burgers,"The place is young and fun.
It has 3 floors. A bar, a restaurant and a rooftop bar. One cannot reserve on the rooftop only at the mid level.
They have a variety of burgers and a hot dog. Al very very good.
It's a must try in Singapore.
The rooftop is very nice as wel for drinks.
Highly recommended"
One rotten Apple ruins the bunch,"The new crew needs to be vetted Although I usually sing th√© praises of this place, this time I‚Äôm √ºberly dissapointed‚Äîso much that I‚Äôm sitting at the bar writing this review... the door‚Äúwoman‚Äù was ungracious and rude. I approached the kiosk and admitted that I hadn‚Äôt made a reservation but asked if there was space on the mezzanine (2nd) level. The hostess abruptly responded, ‚Äùwe‚Äôre booked to capacity‚Äú. I inquired about the certainty of her response because it seemed to be offered before I could complete my query...Long story short...i requested to take a look for myself...AND...the bar was/is wide open....dear potato head folk, don‚Äôt become like ever other eatery in Singapore. Please?

P.S. a photo is attached...it‚Äôs just me and the Manhattan I ordered."
A must visit!,"Absolutely love the cocktail lounge. Has a Moulin Rouge feel to it. Funky music, awesome cocktails and classy decor. Rooftop is also pretty amazing but i prefer indoors. Quick and efficient service."
What to expect?!,"Potato Head was recommended to us as a super place, so we decided to check it out.

First the check-in counter at the street: it was 6pm and the guys made us feel as we are super crazy not booking in advance, really trying to fit us in - its either go or no, what is the show?

When we walked up the whole place seemed to be empty, except for the roof top, but we still got a table. The interior and style of the place is very nice and stylish.

The whole roof top was pretty cramped as if to squeeze in as many people as possible. The lady on the table next to us and me were sitting so close like being best friends. Plus the music was loud (""for the extra-loungy feeling"") so everybody was shouting at each other and overhearing everything said at the next table.

The sofa I was sitting on was super low, so the table was close at the hight of my collar bone - how am I supposed to eat like this?

We decided to have a drink and the small burgers as a snack, which very really good.
When a drunk guys group came up, the noise got unbearable. Staff seemed bored and annoyed - maybe because of the same reasons I was, and we decided to leave the place after one drink."
Beaut Burgers!,"Thursday night out and their booking website had all evening slots as full, so my companion and I decided to wing it and try for a table.

Not to be disappointed we were quickly seated and on first impression it's near impossible not to like the place. Quirky decor and a great atmosphere catering for those wanting either a drink, dinner or both.

We both ordered burgers with sides of fries and a few cocktails to get going.

At first sight the burgers seemed a little on the small side - however they turned out to be rich 'n deliciously greasy hitting the mark flavourwise! Exactly how a burger should be - decadent! Leave room for some sides and dessert - maybe not the choice for a cheap Burger and drinks - but it's Singapore afterall! Check it out!"
Quirky and worth it,"Great service, great burgers! We cane at 4pm in the afternoon on a Sunday. Not to busy but still vibey"
Singapore sling,"Rub shoulders with locals and expats in this small rooftop bar with a good vibe. They mix a good Singapore Sling. The only stumbling block is getting there..... the lass at the door contacts them by 2 way radio, but on 2 occasions said there was standing room only. On the first occasion we opted for the 3rd floor bar instead. But this time we went for a look at this 4th floor venue and stayed as we saw a number of unoccupied tables???"
Delish and friendly,"Loved this restaurant, the burgers were delicious, the service was lovely and best of all, they had reusable metal straws which is something I‚Äôm passionate about :) I‚Äôd highly recommend :)"
Pour on the sauce...,"Tried it when it opened to see if it had improved any, as the first week of the doors opening were chaos, needless to say they did seem to get some of the basics right, but as luck would have it greased soaked paper was the main attraction on my table, when i asked about it to the server the shrugged it off with oh its juicy our burgers are made that way, and its the chefs sauces that make it that way.. Needless to say, We won't be back ,as there didn't seem to be any idea of the customer, it was like that the way it is and thats our style, ...hmmm interesting concept Funny as when you search google nothing but the best ads come up, bots i guess.. I remember reading some where that the company philology was based on a NY restauranteur, guess that got lost in translation.. anyways my next burger ill head over Bk, as i think there motto is have it your way... oh and i forgot to mention the building is really nice!, and the art is cool."
Overpriced and overrated.,"We went to potato head after hearing great things about it online and from people in Bali. It was our first night in Singapore and having just arrived, we wanted something that was going to fill us up.

The place is cool, really nice setting and great music. However, for me at least, the burger was disappointing and the price was daylight robbery.

I had the 2stack shakur- a crispy chicken burger with beer soaked bacon and hot sauce. While the chicken wing it came with was good, the rest of the burger was really disappointing. The chicken was so heavily drenched in sauce that you couldn‚Äôt taste anything else. If there was bacon in there, it was providing absolutely nothing - no texture and no taste. The chicken, which, again, was meant to be crispy, had no crunch to it in the slightest it just tasted like greasy hot sauce.

Oh, and the fries they give you... well, when they say ‚Äòsmall fries‚Äô they really mean it - you get around 10.

Also - side note - my girlfriend had a beef burger and wasn‚Äôt asked how she would like it cooked - something that should be common practice if you serve your burgers rare.

I will say, however, she enjoyed her burger. But, for the prices they‚Äôre charging (which were eye-watering even for a Londoner), they need to be providing a better product."
It‚Äôs a vibe,"Great atmosphere for cocktails, conversation, and hip hop. The food is also perfect for late night noshing."
Food and atmosphere was amazing,It was a good celebration and the food was amazing. They‚Äôre known for their burgers but everything else was yummy. Staff needs to be a bit more attentive to customers.
Excellent drinks and food but aircon very cold & service slow,"This is the second visit to potato head and as much as I enjoy the decor, the vibe, and the ambience, both times the aircon has been absolutely freezing and the service has been quite slow.

The food is absolutely delicious- I had the Pokemon bowl and there was so much tuna and it was great. I also had a variety of cocktails which were all very very well constructed.

I‚Äôd highly recommend but I do think they need to turn up or off the aircon for a more comfortable environment :)"
That IS a tasty burger!,"If Jules Winnfield, Samuel L. Jackson‚Äôs character from the movie Pulp Fiction ate at Potato Head, I am sure he would declare that they had tasty burgers! I loved my burger and fries when I had dinner at this restaurant during my visit to Singapore. The restaurant is in a cool old house where there are multiple dining areas off of a central staircase, where you find funky painted images on the wall and art in small niches.
The burger was incredibly tasty, juicy and the service was wonderful. If you like burgers (one of my fav foods), I highly recommend this hip restaurant. Bon appetit!"
Best Burgers anywhere,"Ate here twice during a short stay in the neighbourhood. Normally, I avoid burgers, but, yum! Totally delicious. One night I had the Rambo, which is a lamb burger with aubergine and cumin mayonnaise. The other I had a cheeseburger (forget the name). Both had excellent quality meat and fantastic dressings. This is not exactly health food -- they should serve everything with a side order of statins! But it's worth going out of your way to eat here, The ambiance of the rooftop bar was wonderful, too. The staff were friendly and helpful"
Smokin' B Boy!,"Pros:
1. Great location2
2. Insanely crispy fries. Very addictive!
3. I visited this place twice since it's close to Six Senses. I tried the Truffello on my first visit and Smokin B Boy on the second one. Both are great! But man, Smokin B Boy is just out of this world. Arguably one of the best burger I've ever tasted
4. Quayside cocktail is a pefect companion to the burger

Cons:
1. Super crowded room
2. Price a bit expensive"
Great burger in Singapore/Ottimo burger,Burger is great and chips are even better. Cheap and tasty. I recommend beef burger with mushrooms and truffle oil. Booking not necessary. Ottimo hamburger con patatine. Molto raccomandato.
Roof top bar,"We went to the Potato Head roof top bar on Saturday night (25th August) for a friends birthday drinks - fantastic location, good views, great atmosphere with a cool vibe and the cocktails were great- would recommend"
Cool spot!,"I visited Potato Head with friends. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the trendy interior design. Food is good and there is one burger for vegetarians, along with some salad options and fries. My friends who live in Singapore eat meat and they mentioned few times that this is THE place for proper delicious burgers! I loved their desserts! There is also a roof bar for cocktails and food. Staff is friendly and attentive."
Nice rooftop bar but limited and expensive drinks,"I was recommended this rooftop bar for it's cocktails so I was surprised when I went that the cocktail list was very limited in comparison to similar bars. There literally were no champagne cocktails and I couldn't even see any vodka ones.

My partner described her cocktail as alcohol-free and my beer was expensive compared to the price I'd pay elsewhere and there was no draught beer.

Service was great, atmosphere fine but there are so many better cocktail bars in Singapore."
Great burgers,Loved their burger and their fries. Very nice spot to visit with Friend ms and celebrate with beautiful people around
Cool place with rooftop bar,"The place us housed in a corner house. It has 3 floors with a restaurant, bar and rooftop bar. People are niceservice is good food is good and do us the atmosphere. Recomend it highly"
Best bar burger,"I was craving for burgers and my hubby took me here for the first time. He told me it's been open for years but I never knew it's existence. Located in the popular keong saik area, full of restaurants n bars n even coffee shops it's easy to miss this out. It's about 4 stories high with a rooftop bar! Very interesting Pinocchio concept inside with paintings n lightings. Most importantly the burger is amazing. Thought we will jus share the Portobello burger with truffle cheese fries but the burger was so good we wanted another one. Wanted 4floors (double cheeseburger) but was sold out so went for the staff recommendation. Kool herc and added a naughty fries. Burger not as good but naughty fries was the best. Do note that the naughty fries n another fries in there seems to have the wrong description. Go for the chilli beef fries (see pic)"
Not a burger!,"On our visit to Singapore we decided to visit potato head because my wife had read about it, and it should be the place if you have a craving for a burger. We got a table on first floor and on that time we should have followed our first impression and left the place. The noise level was horrible high and the acoustic in the room was non existing. We ordered two burger, Baby Huey and Burning man with House Fries on the side. The food was quick served but when we saw the ""burgers"" we could conclude that we only got two ""sliders"" I normally don't complain about the size of the portion, but in this case the size of the burger compare to price was a totally ripoff. The taste of the food was ok, but the Burning Man was very weak. The fries is the only reason for the two stars."
Fantastic Food and Service!!,"I had such an amazing time here! Firstly, this place is extremely instagram worthy with quirkey art and graffitied walls. The rooftop and surrounding area is also quiet aesthetic and nice. The restaurant itself has a very quirky atmosphere with good music and a nice crowd. The food was amazing, there weren't many vegetarian choices but whatever they did have was amazing. The burger I had, The Roots, was beyond delicious. It was fresh and of very good quality. I also had the cookie-icecream dessert which was also very yummy. The service was some of the best I've ever had. Everbody was so nice and helpful, they kept asking how the food was and I never saw them not smiling. One waiter in particular, Christian, was very friendly and hospitable. I am looking forward to going back here."
"Best burgers, best service","Potato Head Folk will forever be my go-to place to get amazing and delicious burgers. Their burgers are unique and always fresh and juicy. Never fails to amaze me how they ensure their standard is always top-notch. We had their truffle fries and chicken wings as well. Simply delicious, especially the sauce that comes with the truffle fries. The staff there were always ensuring we were well taken care of by checking on our food and drinks. Will definitely be back again!"
"Enjoyable dinner, fantastic rooftop terrace, value for money","Just had dinner and drinks at Potato Head. Service was excellent and friendly, from the waiters and manageress Zila. Started in the bar, nice atmosphere with good affordable drinks. Moved to the roof top terrace, tried their burgers, hotdogs and milkshake... Surprised that the prices were so good versus the quality and portion size, truly will recommend to everyone to give it a try. I will definitely be back during my next visit."
Great food with a Wonderful Rooftop,Quirky place with some great Instagram worthy art and graffiti backgrounds as well as a beautiful rooftop. But the best part are their juicy soft burgers and fries on an innovative overall menu! This place has both outdoors and indoor seating so is suitable for quiet dinners as the music is not overpowering either. Great place for evening drinks in a charming street for sure on any day!
Yummy Burgers,We went there in a group and ordered various burgers and wings. The burger were really good. Good quality and so were the wings. A bit on the pricier side but still okay. Nice interior decoration. I will go again
Can't handle large crowds,"We had no reservations on a Saturday evening around 750pm but was accommodated with a very nice sofa seating. As we had been out and about, all of us were hungry. We placed our order quickly anticipating a quicker service. Food came timely but the tribute burger was cold by the time it arrived at the table. Truffle fries was average and soft from the dressing. Iceberg lettuce was also average but all of us enjoyed the bowl of chilli. As a large group came after we did, the staff completely forgotten our dessert. We had to remind twice; and finally served 25 mins after we finished our dinner and 55 mins after we placed the entire order. Overall, nice decor but service was lost in the crowd."
"Hidden gem, great roof top for chilled Sunday drinks","Foodwise has limited range, but it is a great hangout place afterwork. I usually pop over the rooftop on weekends and just chill with friends as it has a nice view of the downtown area of Singapore"
iconic building,"Potato Head Folk is the uber chic establishment that occupies the most iconic building in the area. The building used to be owned by the Tong Ah Kopitiam, an iconic establishment that has been around for decades and represent on of Singapore‚Äôs many cultural heritage. The place is transformed and gentrified and the building where Potato Head is in now is an iconic landmark in the Keong Saik district that has been receiving quite a bit of a revival of late."
