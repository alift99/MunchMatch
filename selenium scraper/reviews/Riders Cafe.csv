"Like the food, love the view",Fell in love with the view. An escapade from the hustle and bustle. A pity that we can no longer enjoying this place after 19 Feb. It will be replaced with mrt works.
What a gem! Pity they will be closing in 2023,Heartened to see the place full even on a weekday morning - perhaps it is because of the Christmas and Holiday season. Will miss this when they close.
Nice place to be at but the food need to be improved,Food can be better. The full set breakfast my son took it is very oily. And the varieties of food that is much to choose.
Thanks for the memories!,"Came here for lunch several times over the years and decided to come here one last time after reading the news that they are forced to close down due to redevelopment of the area.

Food was on point as usual especially the crabmeat sandwich. Coffee was good and the upgrade to truffle fries was definitely better than the standard fries. The Death by Chocolate cake can be a bit jelak if you don't share it with someone else.

Tried asking the staff again if they will open in a new location but seems like the decision was to close down which was sad because we really like the ambience, food and the many beautiful memories.

Thanks to the staff and owners for all your effort over the years to provide diners with pleasant dining experiences!"
Hidden Sanctuary,"Always love this place, it takes your mind away from the bustling city, to indulge in a peaceful and lovely setting, with awesome food and service!"
"Nice, tranquil location and good quality food","Since i arrived in Singapore, 13 years ago, Riders Cafe has always been a nice retreat from the City hustle. I always loved the simple restaurant facing the horses stables and the lush greenery. I always visited for breakfast or lunch or brunch and the ample selection of food and drinks never disappointed. Good quality, reasonable price, attentive service. It is really a pity that it will be forced to close down at the end of January 2023 as the land plot has been reclaimed for urbanistic redevelopment"
would love to come back,"second visit and decided to bring my family along this time and riders cafe did not disappoint. food was excellent, atmosphere was relaxing and exciting, its a pity that it would be closing soon. would love to come back."
Another Rare Excellent Cafe that is going to go,"This is one of the cafe that is nicely tuck away in the nature and away from all the busy and noisy city life. It is just next to a horse stable so you will have waves of horse poop smell with the wind but that is the wonder of the cafe, if you get what I mean. However, if you are someone who is very particular with toiletries smell, then guess you will not be able to have a meal there. Having said that, if you are one who loves nature and do not care about the smell, then it is a great Sunday outing for family and friends to visit and have nice and relaxing meal or a beautiful wedding reception venue to go to as one of my best friend's wedding was held there 8 years ago.

Due to the cross island MRT line, it will be closing down in Feb 2023 and was in the news recently, so we decided to go for a brunch on 02 Oct 2022. It was very crowded, presumably people were also there after seeing the news. We have ordered the buddha bowl and the rosti with sausage which both are done to perfection. We also had 3 cups of their Long black at a price of $5 each (where to find such nice and cheap coffee now?!). If you haven't gone to this cafe before, just go at least once to enjoy the whole special atmosphere before it's gone."
Gooey Croque Madame,Really nice location with view over the stables. Service is hands off with QR code to order food. Wish the service was more hands on but can understand with shortage of workers this may not be possible to achieve. Ordered Croque Madame this time and was so gooey and kinda not tasty that it didn't get finished. I will order something different next time.
Wonderful lunch experience,"Nice foods with good scenery, credit to hard working service team as well. Have done a good job and keep it up. Cheers"
Lovely ambience,Spent brunch with some girl-friends on a week day. Lovely place; good service and yummy food with generous portions.
Kudos,"Great experience, food & ambience. If it can eliminate or reduce the odour, it would be fantastic. No other comments."
Lovely brunch area‚Ä¶,"Love this place for couple, family or friends‚Ä¶ nice ambiance, minus the nature smell of horses‚Äô manure but if we sit near the carpark, it‚Äôs acceptable‚Ä¶ Swift service & prompt delivery of food‚Ä¶"
Food was average,"We ordered the Pulled Pork Rosti, Banana bread and Sausage platter. The former were pretty average - pulled port wasn't as tender, banana bread lacked banana flavour. Only the latter would be a saving grace. Staff was friendly and helpful."
Yummy,"Great experience and ambiance, my daughter spilled her drink and without asking her drink was replenished and table and floor was cleaned immediately. Thanks for making my daughter feel better!"
Good restaurant,"Nice place, nice view, foods are delicious, good service, free plain waters(service always keep top up with jug of water), will come again"
Good selection!,The service was great. The menu selection is good. One can order breakfast during lunh hours. One can enjoy a terrific view of the Saddle Club and greenery!
Good location food okay,Based up by the stables which is away from everything else at Turf. Menu good but food just average and not value for money. Location and view good with pleasant service
Nice cafe,"I when during the late afternoon 3pm. The serving size was great, but i was hoping that theres more variety of food to choose from. Perhaps try to go before 3pm or after 5pm."
Lovely experience,Great food and excellent service surrounded by lush greenery. It‚Äôs a pity that the land will be taken back and the restaurant will have to move soon. Treasuring the remaining days. Great memories here.
"Place to chillax, away for city buzz","Decent place to relax, need more helicopter fans to cool the cafe on sunny days. Food is decent, price a bit on high side for the quality and portion."
Average,Food‚Äôs average. More for families. Place is rather inaccessible unless you drive in. But service is good.
Latest visit,The atmosphere was delightful as always and the service good. The Barramundi (& chips) however was disappointing compared to that on previous occasions..
Rider's- into the woods,"Service with a smile. Soup and salad were reasonably good. The pork dush was however, dry. Quaint ambience, albeit a little spooky at night."
Cozy place,"Like the environment, cozy with green view‚Ä¶non aircon environment‚Ä¶a bit hot when we start our dinner at 5pm"
Busy Cafe,Busy and noisy. Limited breakfast choices and some come with ice creams which is not healthy. Coffee is ok.
Great,"wonderful atmosphere, great staff, attention and very nice food! couldn't recommend more - the place is on a very relaxed location - it looks like you are HOURS away of the busy SG."
Tranquility away from the city,"Conchiglie In Beef Rib Ragu is nice, the beef is juicy, the bacon adds crunchiness, I like the cream cheese they put on top of this dish. Also ordered the signature Death by Chocolate, love the chocolate cake but not the chocolate condensed milk I feel that is a bit much. Atmosphere is nice, tranquil, away from the city and minimum noise from other guests. We didn‚Äôt travel by our own car, we had to walk, not pedestrian friendly, I‚Äôd recommend you order a ride to the venue from the mrt station."
Blend overpriced food,"Service was fine. Food for the value was not up to expectation.

Beer battered fish and chips with parmesan truffle fries: no taste of beer found, just a typical battered fish and chips. Parmesan fries very stingy with parmesan and taste of truffle minimal.

Squid ink seafood risotto: risotto mashed up. However doesn‚Äôt taste that fantastic.

$10 seafood chowder: slightly overpriced but I have to say was pretty good. The $1 add-on bread was really good as well."
A Change,"Off Eng Neo Avenue. Nice location , nice setup , nostalgic as the cafe is on ‚Äòcolonial‚Äô bungalow . Ambience is nice . Coffee is good and the dessert Death By Chocolate is a must try . The servings pretty large and unless you‚Äôre a strong dessert supporter, the servings good for 2 or more . Get a table on the verandah / balcony - and will be treated with a view of horses , greenery - a pleasant change of environment . Recommend to give this a try ."
Overpriced,"Overprices food and drinks. Food was good, but not worth the enormous prices. $14 mimosa is insane ü§°"
"Nice ambience, nice food and great service! Thank you üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª","This is my second time celebrating my birthday in this restaurant, me and my family love the ambience, the food and great service! Thank you üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
A breezy evening.,We wanted to spend an evening in a different setting so having high tea while watching the horses pass by was a nice change. It's not halal reason we opted for high tea. It's a good ambiance.
Great until departure.,"Food is wonderful, service is wonderful. The downside is public transport is difficult from there. You will want to coordinate prior for pickup to be able to leave under understandable financial conditions."
Good service good ambiance,"Staff are friendly and helpful. Food are nice too, with a cosy setup. The overall experience is wonderful and we have a good outing."
Best Place to escape the hustle of Singapore,"Aside from the food being amazingly great, the tranquility of the environment and the simplicity of horses just walking by the carpark as if they themselves had parked cars, was breathtaking! Perfect for a first date, date night, or a simple chill evening. Staff were amazing! Ambience was fantastic! Would surely come back again for my next date night with my wife! Thank you Rider‚Äôs Cafe!"
Lovely environment,"Pros :The environment was great , food was superb and service lvl is great too ! Cons :You will need to have your own transport if not to grab there as its not so accessible"
Pleasant lunch with family,"Though the staff were very busy, they were always available to help with the orders and clarifications. Very friendly and courteous staff which makes your day. The restaurant can be more generous with condiments. Perhaps cushioned seats be available for the elderly who are more skinny. It was a very warm day"
Nice setting and nice food,"It is a very authentic restaurant in a very green setting, no air con, but with all the windows open and the fans is quite cool. I love the tables by the veranda. Nice for all meals, the food is quite good. I recommend."
Cosy dinner at Riders Cafe,"Wife and I decided to visit Riders Cafe for dinner. My last visit there was for lunch.

It was a relatively low traffic week night so we had a choice of balcony and indoor tables.

The cafe is part of the Bukit Timah Saddle Club, we get to see the horses as well as smell of their body output. While we enjoy the view from the balcony we decided to move indoor to enjoy our food.

We ordered breads and dips for starter, a crab linguine and pan roasted sea bass for mains.

The staff were patient and helpful. I like the roasted sea bass, it was tender and had a crispy skin. The crab linguine was a tad too spicy for wife.

Overall we had a pleasant evening at the Riders Cafe."
Away from the crowd,"Was another pleasant visit to Riders. Food was good and tho lesser staff, there were lesser crowd due to the dining restrictions. It‚Äôs a lot more pleasant without too much noise in the evening. Staff were polite and helpful. Will definitely return again."
nice ambiance superb service,"the staffs are very helpful and their service deserves thumbs up! food and beverage are great, especially the earl grey lavender iced tea!"
Oct 2021 visit,"Rider's is my favourite breakfast go to whenever I am in town. It's been a while since I last visited - more than a year. Quite disappointed with the service. 45 minutes from the time I placed our order to the time we were served. In fact someone came to check only after about 30 mins to asked if we had placed the order. 2 other patrons that came after us received their food before us. Showed the text message that confirmed. No apologies, nothing. Service had never been the best here, but it's at its worst I've experienced. I will come back though because I do love the ambience and the food."
Laid back cafe serving good food,Visited this cafe multiple times. A bit hard to get there if you don't drive but the food is good. My wife likes the Crab melt sandwich a lot. Nice laid back ambient for a catch up.
"Nice food, tranquil environment",Reasonably priced food. Everything we ordered was well prepared and tasted good. I would've preferred a wider wine list. Had an Aussie chardonnay - nice enuff.
Away from the hustle & bustle of the city,"Lovely place for a quiet dinner. Food was awesome, coupled with friendly service staff. And if you sat by the balcony, you‚Äôd have a view of the horses in the stable."
good service,"food is average, but the service is good. keep up the good work. Nice place to chat with friends, out of city.."
VERY DISSAPOINTED.,"This cafe has been one of my favourites with my go to food being the rosti with sausage.
Today I visited and ordered the rosti.
The rosti has changed from when I have visited previously. It now looks like it is cooked in a large square pan...more like baked mash potato than rosti... then a slab cut for a serving. Previously it was an individual rosti.
All the food on the plate appeared to be pre-cooked.
Rosti.... Cold, dry and overcooked.
Sausage.... Cold.
Bacon.... Cold.
Poached eggs.... Warm.
The waitress enquired how my meal was while I was eating....I told her it was very disappointing and explained why. She said she would get me a new one and returned it to the kitchen. The 2nd meal was a big improvement...The rosti was fresher and moist, and everything was hot. But, it all still seemed like pre-cooked food heated up for serving.
The service staff were great...as was the coffee.
The food was way below the standard I have come to expect at Riders and it would be a deterrent to me returning. It seems the chefs are taking short cuts."
great ambience non aircon restaurant,"if you prefer no aircon environment, great greenaries and good food, this is the place to be in. only challenges is you cannot buy chope vouchers on the spot once you order food, the waiters do not allow - very strange arranagement ..."
Nice place for meeting up,"Table is available at reserved time, which is nice. Food is reasonable good. 2nd visit and 2nd time ordering the parmesan chicken wings, my favorite. Managed to see the horses going out for a 'walk'. No aircon but airy enough."
Great quiet place with delicious food!,Food was great and is has a new and quiet enivronment. great place to visit if you want to stay away from the busy city lifestyle.
Cafe with a Stable View,"Food was average. Prices on the high side.
They have a house recipe for Bloody Mary, with wasabi flavour. I prefer the traditional Bloody Mary but if you're up for some heat in your nose, this might Bloody be the Mary for you.
If you go during the day you might be able to see the horse out and about. Beware of mozzies."
Pleasant lunch in a peaceful surrounding,"After our sunday morning exercise, my friend suggested to have brunch here. It is my first time visiting & i am glad we chose this place.

First it is away from the hustle & bustle of malls & second the greenery surrounding is definately a change of refreshing sceneary. The cafe's interior design is minimalist with rustic feeling.

We were lucky there was available table upon our arrival.
We were served by Miss Jolin whom is friendly & attentive.
We ordered :
- maple smoked duck & egg benedict
- brioche french toast
- smashed avacado & eggs
- rosti & sausage
- crepes suzette

The food was served promptly & good portion. The poached egg was executed perfectly & every dish was cooked well & delicious. Kudos to the chef !!

The only downside, the cafe is located away from main road hence it is inconvenience for anyone taking public transport.
.... but it is definately a trade off if you prefer to dine in a secluded location with lush of green sceneary & most likely seeing riders riding horses around the surrounding.

I will definately be back

p/s : the cafe is next to horse riddle club

SINGAPORE"
Early dinner treat,It was 5.30pm. Three of us were given a table on the balcony. We could see the horses being groomed and being led out. It was a treat for us - city folks. Food was good and service courteous.
Favorite coffee place,I love the cafe. This is one of a few places in Singapore where you can be in an open air place near nature without the noise of the city. The food and the coffee is good and the staff is very friendly.
Nice cosy eatery,Nice cosy and homely setting amidst the Saddle Club. Nice change from shopping malls. Fuss free way to order and pay for food via app. Food is delicious and service is attentive.
A perfect evening!,"We started with the cerviche salad and Canadian oysters, had ciopinno for mains and crepe suzette for dessert. Food was great although we were expecting the crepe suzette to be flamb√©d. I couldn‚Äôt taste the liqueur either. A huge plus point is they serve water- this makes you feel very welcomed indeed!! Service was excellent (the two staff were professional, friendly, had initiative and worked hard- rare in Singapore). We had a balcony seat, close to the horses, from where we could take in the cool of the evening, including whatever was wafting in from the stables (which we didn‚Äôt mind at all!). It was a 10/10 visit!"
Excellent food and service!,The staff were very polite and attentive. The food was very scrumptious. The cafe was well ventilated.
Overated restaurant,The cafe doesnt have air-conditional and it can be very stuffy and hot during the hot day. Not suitable to bring kids as the hot and noisy environment. The food price is not worthy with this kind of environment.
Great experiences!,"The place is very ulu but with a few GPS research won't be a problem. Food was excellent ordered sea bass & fish and chips, fish was treat well no stinking fishy smell but was tender, refreshing and plus abit of sweetness with every bite we had. The crew staffs was friendly and attentive and asked us few time regarding about how well is their foods and services. Overall had a great early dinner/late lunch and able to relax in a open air with a cooling atmosphere and viewing the horses training at a distance was a great experience we had, definitely will come back again!"
Cafe with a view of the greenery,"I have eaten both breakfast and lunch at this cafe on two different occasions and I travelled here in a car both times. What keeps me from coming back is the rustic ambience of the cafe that is so rare in Singapore. The lush greenery of the surrounding paddocks let me imagined that I was in the countryside in England. I went back for a third time last Monday and was very disappointed that the cafe is closed on Monday. However we had a very lovely walk here and I will be bringing more friends to walk here followed by a meal at this cafe.
We started our walk at the Sixth Ave MRT station and walked along Turf Club Road towards Blue House International School. On both sides of the road are lush vegetation such as the Akar Mempelas, Barwood and the Clock Vine with its lilac flowers. We took a slight detour at the unused section of Vanda Link to view two single storey black and white houses. We also saw the White leafed Fig with its different leaves varying in shape from being elliptic, heart shaped to palmate, with 3-5 lobes. Another interesting place along the route is Antique Row which consists of four warehouses selling a very wide range of antiques. Its rooftop is overgrown with shrubs and trees. Antique row is a very unique treasure trove and definitely a hidden gem.
Just before we reached the cafe are many blocks of old unused houses with chimneys which used to house the employees of the Turf Club such as the apprentice jockeys, syces, riding boys and workers. There are several rambutan and chempedek trees here.
Next to the cafe are many stables of Bukit Timah Saddle Club. We saw a gentle white horse grazing the grass at the field. Some horses are retired race horses re-trained and redeployed for recreational use. Overall this cafe is situated in a beautiful setting among stables and paddocks in a sea of green."
A Hidden Gem,Had lunch with my hubby. Service was good and food was delicious. Parking was free. Only thing that caused some discomfort was that the fan was not strong enough to cool the place in this hot weather.
Great ambience. Food could be improved.,"i loved the ambience and being able to see the horses exercising and munching hay in their stalls. The food was a bit of a let down though after all the rave reviews I received from friends. The angus steak (medium rare) that i ordered was on the chewy side and there wasn't any gravy for the steak or mash potatoes so the meal was a tad dry for me. My husband had the riders burger. Same experience for him. We ordered death by choc for dessert. We thought the cake could be more moist. That said, it was overall a good place to sit back and chillax and the service staff were generally nice and polite."
A tad disappointed,We‚Äôve been coming to Riders since 2005 but not so in the last 5 years. Surprisingly our breakfast choices were bland & presentation could have been better. Service & ambience excellent as always.
Always a great dining experience,"I have visited Riders Cafe many times and the food quality and service are consistently great. I have always had a service staff stop by my table during my meal to ask if everything is ok. They keep the drinking water topped up. The food is wonderful whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner. Most recently, we had a birthday dinner and the bill came up to about $55 each for 5 of us, which is actually good value."
Great laidback cafe,"We love the place, always nice to be able to be surrounded by lush greenery and horses. A pity are the food, ordered the Impossible burger but the patty was hard and dry (overcooked). The Orecchiette Pasta with Portobello was close to tasteless. Save for the Truffle Fries which was still good. But we do applaud the service of the staff, they are friendly though."
Plesant experience,"Nice atmosphere and great food but there is a smell from the horses A bit far, need transport. Need more seatings"
Mum's birthday Celebration,It was a wonderful experience and my mum had a great time. Due to safe distancing we didn't get the corner seat at the verandah but nevertheless we had a lovely time.
Excellent Food with Very Good Service,"mostly people go back to the same place not just because of the food but the way staff give service to customers. This one is really good for both. Nice place. nice food with reasonable price and way excellent service from the staff and crews. I hope it won't change and they will keep showing the same good service all throughout., We will definitely come back again."
Nice countryside feel,"Back again after 2 years, food quality seems to have gotten better. They adopted tech in their ordering system, makes things easier and more complicated at the same time. Easier to just order and to pay, but certain food items only show up after a fixed timing. Not too friendly. Still gives a nice countryside feel.."
Enjoyed the setting,"Never been even though it isn't far from where I stay. Like the ambience... no air conditioning but airy and with the unique whiff of horses just across the window. Liked that there are recommendations of drinks to go with the food. Pretty extensive menu, attentive serving staff. Had an enjoyable evening. The pasta in squid ink is a tad sweet, but came with generous portions of lump crab meat. The steak was nicely flavoured and came with truffle fries."
Catch up with retirees,"Had a balcony seat with gentle breeze blowing. Sight of the horses calm the nerves of us 4 retirees
Menu offers wide selection for us to choose items that suit our varied tastes.
The service was excellent. We were touched by the politeness & positivity of the staff.
My friends who were first time there announced they would return."
Thank you for a wonderful experience,"Rider's Cafe was the perfect place to relax and unwind. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful from the start. They were quick to inform me when a balcony table was available and were happy to move me so that I would enjoy the outdoors, outstanding customer service. I enjoyed 1.5 hours reading with my book, occasionally looking up to enjoy the horses and greenery.

Order the Death By Chocolate Cake. I thought it looked great in photos until it was placed in front of me. Can't wait to have it soon."
Awesome Food & Service,Really enjoyed the food and service provided. What's better is that all the orders and payment is done on our phone! üòÅ Thank you to all who served us wholeheartedly giving us a pleasant experience.
Probably not for future meals,First the positives. Friendly staff and an outdoor setting. Good selection of food items including vegetarian burger and orecchiette pasta. Why won‚Äôt we come back in the future? Noticed a number of tables where diners had finished eating and drinking but masks were not worn and staff did not reinforce this rule. Very mediocre coffee - think burnt-bean taste. Staff were quick to remake but alas not much improvement.
good time,"first time, enjoyed very much the entire experience; sandwich, salad, coffee, the scones (wished they use fresh whipped cream), and of course the serene (and the natural smelly) surrounding... shall return!"
Nice ambience but food could be better,"No complains, all nice and lovely. But food could be better. Driving out that far for just that food, wo I won‚Äôt do again."
Food was so yummy!,"Love the ambience of the place and the food was SO GOOD. Though it can be on the pricey side, but totally worth it for the quality of food (: staff were also really friendly, allowing us to change seats to be at the window seating area. They would also come up to ask how the dinner is tonight! Also, they take the time to sanitise tables, giving all of us a really great and safe dining experience (:"
Great atmosphere,"The environment is nice and beside a stable, the food taste not bad however serving portion is a bit small"
Brunch by the stable,"Nice place for a quiet brunch beside the stable. Be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment. Balcony seats are not allow to reserve but when we arrived we were given the balcony seats. The view is overlooking the stable and have a clear view of the horses. The weather is really nice and cool due to the the morning shower.

The service is excellent, they came to check out how we felt about the food which is a nice gesture. We ordered the Brioche French Toast and added bacon. It‚Äôs really savory and taste really good. The homemade Rosti and sausage is also good, just the that it‚Äôs a bit dry. There are better rosti.

Overall a good morning brunch experience. Highly recommended and try to avoid weekends as it can get really crowded and busy."
nice ambience and good food,"saw some reviews saying the food is mediocre. IMHO, you need to order not-so-common food/mains. avoid so called signature burger and stuffs. the crab chunk squid ink pasta is superb. death by chocolate is a must. we double down it!"
So far so good,"Food is normal and price is reasonable, overall the service is okay. We request to have the table on terrace and they have a good arrangement to us but there is too hot, if I come again I will choose to seat inside."
Dine next to horse saddle,"Nice environment, lots of green surroundings. Order food through mobile apps. Had a steak, the mash potatoes is nice but the steak is average. My husband had pulled pork and rosti, nice! My gal have the crab sandwich which in my opinion is average only."
Dining with horses,"The long road in made it feel like a journey outside of Singapore, and provided a nice sense of anticipation.
The ambience of the Cafe overlooking a barn for horses was simply charming, with plenty of interesting birds at a comfortable distance flocking about among the trees.
The food was just great too, and the service joyful."
Enjoyable Sunday Brunch in Riders Cafe,"Located within Saddle Club, this is a nice location for brunch, lunch and afternoon tea. It can be very popular over the weekend so it is a good idea to make an early reservations (three weeks‚Äô advance now!!). We tried our lunch today and arrived around 8:50am and got a table for four. Ordered Full-on usual, Croque Madame, Brioche French Toast and Smashed Avo & Eggs. Girls enjoyed their ice late and Affogato. Ordering and payment done via online menu and service is fast. Very enjoyable experience since we last came over ten years ago."
"Lovely ""country side"" cafe","Far from the madding crowd stood a stand-alone quaint cafe. That's its charm. But wish there's air-con , esp for the hot afternoons. The food lives up to your expectations - solid, flavourful and happy food for the tummy. Will be back!"
"Amazing service, away from city","Had an early breakfast at Riders cafe today. Food was reasonably priced and taste great. Good service staffs. It gives you a feeling of being away from city, watching horses as we had breakfast, something different. Will definitely be back."
smell of horses (or maybe horses‚Äô poop?) while you are eating,"Big glass for the milkshake, I not able to finish it. I love the crepe. The Sweetness is just nice. There‚Äôs the smell of horses (or maybe horses‚Äô poop?) while you are eating but if that‚Äôs ok with u then it‚Äôs fine. The table is sticky or maybe it‚Äôs just our table. Young staffs are accommodating."
Lovely lunch venue in the countryside,"I‚Äôd managed to get out of my WFH (work from home) routine to meet a friend for lunch at the Riders Cafe.

We arrived at about 1.15pm. The place was almost full but we‚Äôd managed to get a table fairly quickly.

This is a restaurant set in a old house, in a countryside setting (although it is strange to use this term in urban Singapore), looking out to stables and horses.

We had pastas (seafood aglio olio) and a crepe for dessert. Both pasta and crepe were good, the portions were just right.

Staff are friendly and helpful, though the food took a while to arrive.

Overall we had a enjoyable lunch at the Riders Cafe."
Wonderful,"Wonderful cafe with a nice ambiance. Love the balcony view. Foods are good. My kids love the kid‚Äôs burger & pasta! I‚Äôve got myself roasted sea bass, just slightly salty for my taste buds. Overall we had a great dinner celebrating our anniversary!"
Outing sep,Great ambience and staff. Food portion to ex. Perhaps set dinner variety worth it. Cos with 1.5 hrs we can do other stuff.
Great Service. Nice landscape,"The service of the lady at the reception is great. She suggested that we should share a drink due to the large sizes of their smoothies and milkshakes. We ordered full-on usual, brioche French toast, homemade rosti and breakfast sausage. All tasted great. We sat at the balcony so we could see the horses in the stables and field. Will definitely return to try their dinner menu next time."
Great place to meet!,Our group of four very much enjoyed the breakfast there. Nice and fast service. The quality of the food was excellent. We will definitely come back again.
Clear lack of understanding of the safe distancing measures,My fam of 6 adults 1 child 8 yo and 1 infant 7 mths old in a pram...we booked 2 tables as max is 4 per table...was told the tables cannot be adjacent but diagonal can..the distance btw adjacent and diagonal is almost the same -1 metre. So we were told cannot sit on adj table but ok to sit at the table diagonal to the one seated?? When asked to exp..staff is unable to do so? Just it is the govt rule?? Then no talking between the tables but strangely the peoplecseared adj to us are talking loudly and they are from a diff family..yet we coming from the same household nit allowed to even talk to one another ..yet the distance btw the tables is the same..plus we were ticked off just becoz my 8yo went over to to get the handphone fr her Dad to key in our orders??The very bad assumption made here is tt we were going to share food..and so they wanted us to sit far apart..using safe distancing as an excuse when it makes better safe distancing sense to keep people from the same household in 2 tables adj to each other rathercthen take the risk of putting another family between us..common sense is not part of the menu at Riders Cafe. Such an unpleasant dinner outing for the family.
It is like eating at an English countryside,It is like eating at an English countryside. Food is western and fish batter is thin and crispy. Salad is interesting with apple strips. Not recommended for the wheelchair bound or not so IT savvy people.
Never Dissatisfied,"Our favourite brunch spot. Service is top notch, beautiful relaxed environment, Amazing food!! Wont stop going!! Budha bowl, Full household breakfast & passion smoothie is always a winner!!"
Brunch by the Stables,"Umm this place was right beside the Stables in Bukit Timah. It's a pretty place away from the city. So you can chill on a Sunday for brunch. I ordered brunch/breakfast food...it was average, nothing unique. Definitely, the ambience is the selling point for this cafe. We also went by the stables to see the horses.
Overall it was a good experience1"
Nice brunch,"Went with friends for brunch.
Tried the smashed avo breakfast, the avocado club and a burger, all were delicious and the portions were generous.
Œëlso had iced americano, which was good.
The atmosphere was pleasant and the surroundings very nice.
Most importantly, all hygiene rules were followed, staff wore masks at all times, tables were disinfected, cutlery was clean, distances kept, facilities were clean."
Great place and Food,Great location and ambience. The place was quiet and absolutely stunning with the late afternoon sun. The quality of food is good. And all the staff are very attentive.
Pleasant experience.,Had lunch next to a horse stable. Something you rarely get to see these days. Back to nature and wildlife.
