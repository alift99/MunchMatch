Amazing service and food!,My boyfriend and I came here for dinner after seeing a friend‚Äôs post. We were pleasantly surprised and fell in love with this place. The food is super worth its price and the staff were absolutely great. We highly recommend the lobster bisque and seafood risotto! Will be back here again for sure.
French Toast? French Kiss? More like French Serenity.,"You would think naming a restaurant ‚ÄúThe White Label‚Äù doesn‚Äôt necessarily constitutes to an F&B establishment but boy, have we ever been more wrong on this beauty.

Their spicy linguine is a MUST-TRY and especially their chocolate hazelnut as well. The Hokkaido Pan Seared Scallops is not too shabby either. Overall, delicious halal French cuisine with a local touch. It‚Äôs got my vote ! ‚úå"
Dinner was amazing!,Food was absolutely delicious. Wonderfully executed and super value for money. Would recommend to try everything if I could. Will definitely see me again.

Unique dining destination,"This place transports you to Paris, commonly known as the city of Light. Unique French Malayan cuisine is served here. I had a fork-tender pulled beef placed in a flaky shell which was topped with a garnish of chili that was delicious. It was on the menu identified as TWL's Vol Au Vert. Safe room for dessert."
Dinner cum birthday surprise,"Food was delish, service crew was amazing. Thanks Ain for the birthday surprise and complimentary birthday cake as well!"
Wedding Anniversary Celebration,Food was superb. Staff was efficient and friendly. Thanks for the complimentary cake. Preciate it lots. Definitely recommended to all to visit this place
The White Label SG,"I'm very happy with the food, i ate the Beef Wellington for the first time. But it's very expensive because for the first time i had my food in ""The White Label SG""."
Amazing food and service!,5 out of 5 amazing service and great quality of food! Came in to dine for a friend‚Äôs birthday celebration. Additional they surprised her with a complimentary cake too. Will definitely come back! thank you!
Marvellous Food!,Food was awesome. Love the ambience. Service was fantastic! A sure recommendation... ü§© Came for a company bonding and they accommodate to all our requests.
Fantastic service and delicious food,"The service was amazing from booking reservations to the end of the dinner, and furthermore the food was amazing. We had the risotto and steak and both was good"
review,amazing food would definitely come again for the squid ink spaghetti and truffle mushroom cheddar ( garlic bread was perfection) good service kind staff place was packed hence slightly noisy
5 star experience,We celebrated my husband‚Äôs birthday in The White Label restaurant. The food was amazing! My husband ordered beef ribs and it was so tasty and soft it melts in your mouth. I ordered the smoked steak and it was so delicious. The staff were accommodating and friendly. We did not wait too long for the food to arrive and my husband got a complementary slice of sponge cake we absolutely love.
Surprising Franko-Malay fusion,"I thought this fusion restaurant sounded a bit...ordinary, in fact, I only tried it as I had a credit voucher from nearby hotel for this restaurant - how wrong I was. My meal at The White Label was the best meal I had in Singapore during a 3-day trip.
Thinking back, this was probably more classic French with some Malay flavours rather than a 50/50 fusion...and it worked. Think buttery, delicate French with some extra flavours, such as chilli and lemongrass.
Additionally, the service was excellent and the setting refined when compared to nearby restaurants
I'm not going to describe it in too much detail; all I will say is give it a go.
Would I visit The White Label again? It will be the first restaurant I eat at when next in Singapore :)"
Delicious food. Wonderful service,"Had the TWL Vol-Au-Vent kueh pie tee, lobster brisque, Two Way Fish Frites barramundi and Entrec√¥te Aux Potato Pav√©s steak and Mango Sea Coconut for dessert. All tasted fantastic. Food came promo as well. Suitable for all ages."
Great experience here!,"The food here is amazing, im absolutely in love with the pandan creme brulee! The two way fish frites is a winner for us. On top of that, service here is really great, they even gave us a birthday cake for my sister and sang for her! Love it! Will be back again for sure! :)"
The white label,Great food and great staff. Staff Aimil was friendly ans helpful. Will visit again. Very spacious and family friendly
An Amazing meal at The White Label,"We pulled up in front of The White Label and I immediately asked my husband if we were in the right place. From the outside, the restuarant is in a very modest looking building along a busier street in Singapore. But stepping though the front door was like Dorothy stepping out of her house in ‚ÄúThe Wizard of Oz‚Äù‚Ä¶everything was in color, beauty, friendly and stunning!

The restaurant was proably one of the best meals I‚Äôve ever eaten anywhere in the world, albeit different than our standard venues. To begin, there‚Äôs no alcohol served (no wine, no beed, no spirits)‚Ä¶definiltey not a problem. Secondly, one orders online from a QR code at the table instead of with your server.

But don‚Äôt let either of these issues fool you‚Ä¶.Our service was excellent, attentive and always available to assist with questions or suggestions. The atmosphere is chic, bright and cheerful.

And the food is definitely the star of the show here. I had the best halibet I‚Äôve ever had with a beautiful lemon butter sauce while my husband had the ‚Äúfish two ways‚Äù with fried and grilled fish‚Ä¶simply amazing. The food was plentiful, beautifully presented and perfectly cooked and seasoned. And as a special surprise, since it was my husband‚Äôs birthday, they presented us with a slice of cake that was far and away the single best slice of cake I‚Äôve ever had in my entire life‚Ä¶still don‚Äôt know how they got the butter cream so light and smooth!

If you can only have one meal in Singapore‚Ä¶definitely have it here. If you can time for multiple meals in Singapore‚Ä¶eat them ALL here. The menu is extensive, and choices plentiful. Definltey we will be back!"
It was a belated birthday celeb!,"Great customer service & really love ambience of the restaurant! Food was good & the lobster soup its a must to try! ü§ç Overall, im satisfied. & they even cater to a compliment birthday cake üíØ love it! Thank you for having us TWLüïä"
Delicious meal & good seevice,Enjoyed the food here!! The portion is big and worth the money!! Forgot to take picture of the Two Way Fish Frites! But it‚Äôs super good too!! Two different fishes! Battered & Grilled Barramundi is so good!! Thick slab of fish!
"EXCELLENT SERVICE, GREAT AMBIENCE, GOOD FOOD,","Place to be of you want excellence in every aspect. Food, service, ambience, everything. Only good things for me to say!!"
Outstanding food in an unassuming spot - well worth seeking out,"Right from the start, when we arrived we thought ‚ÄúAre we in the right place?‚Äù. The neighborhood is very local with most of the signs written in an Asian language and when you find the restaurant it is very unassuming from the outside. BUT once you go inside the greeting is warm and friendly. We were shown to our table on the second floor as the first floor was full; The White Label is clearly a local restaurant, just the kind we love, with not a tourist in sight. At the table we were told to scan the QR code for the menu and order directly from there. It seemed odd, but it was like any online shopping experience: find what you want and click ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù. Easy peasy. After a few minutes our drinks arrived (see note below). A short while later our entrees were delivered. We weren‚Äôt terribly hungry so passed on starters (which based on the entrees must be equally amazing). One of us ordered the Pan Seared Halibut, the other the Barramundi Two Ways. All I can say is that both were outstanding in taste and presentation. The fish in both dishes was fresh and flaky. The Halibut was served with mushy peas, asparagus and broccoli. The Barramundi was served with truffle fries. When we were finished our lovely server asked if we wanted dessert. Sadly we were stuffed. SURPRISE! ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù and a slice of light and moist cake wishing me a Happy 60th Birthday. So kind (and SO delilcious!)_. The White Label was an incredible find; it‚Äôs off the beaten path but SO worth seeking out! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Note: The White Label does not serve alcohol, but the food is so good you won‚Äôt even miss it!"
Go to place,Good ambience good service with good foood. Recommended. Lovely place to hangout too. Give it a try!
Anniversary Dinner,The food and service was great. Just that the air con is blowing at us causing us to freeze when we were having our dessert. Other than that all is great and will come back again

Anniversary dinner,Very nice food. Nice ambience and very swift service. Even gave me a complimentary anniversary cake for me and wife.

Superb!,"Superb food and ambience. Will come back for more! Tried Squid ink pasta, pulled beef pasta and pandan creme brulee. All are delicious!"
Simply delicious!,"Was there for a birthday dinner.

Love the food. The portions are generous right from starters down to desserts. I'm amazed that the sweet potato frites goes very well with the sambal belacan mayonaise sauce. For starters we also had their chicken wings, Vol-Au-Vent and lobster bisque. Everything was impressively delicious.

For the mains, we had Poulet a la creme and duck conflit. The reason for the 4-star is because the Poulet (oven baked crispy chicken) taste abit tad too dry. But the duck was great nonetheless.

Had creme brulee and cempedak gateau for desserts and it's delicious as well.

Overall, we paid over $170 for all of those inclusive 2 drinks, but its money well spent. Will definitely come back"
