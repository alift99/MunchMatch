Great Indian food,"If you are looking for North and South Indian dishes at one place , this is it. Loved the ambience and food. Special mention to the polite staff. All the dishes are reasonably priced and the portions are Just right. Don’t forget to try their naans and biryani.
I am going back to try their desserts and street food."
Great Indian food!,Great tasting Indian food and reasonable prices on beer too!! The vindaloo is a must try!! Been to a few Indians in Singapore and ordered a few in and this is the best I have had for a curry!
Poor experience,The meal was sub-standard. The tandoori chicken was extremely dry and naan bread was not right. There was absolutely no ambiance - we were in and out within 30 minutes. The place was not well maintained as there were little bugs everywhere.
Zero service,"We were the only guests and were totally ignored. The only cold drink available was Coke Zero, and they did not manage to bring this within 15 minutes. The 2 staff were busy on calls. We got up and left."
Good Food but Service is Kind of Slow,"Food is reasonably priced but the service is slow. Only one service crew. If they could serve faster, that will be good. If u have time to spare, will be a good place for a meal."
Payment,During payment- paid twice via paylah and again at leaving. Not helpful at chope discount. Though at first a waiter assisted and payment went through. Paid prior to visit on 28/2 and on 2/3 using paylah on spot and the when checking out.

Excellent food and service!,"We actually had the food delivered for a gathering at our place, and Sam from Aromas of India did a great job helping me place the order. He took a photo of the bill once finalized and I settled it through PayNow.

We tried the butter chicken, lamb roganjosh, malai kofta, palak paneer, and methi fish. All the dishes were delicious and suitable for a foreign palette. The fish was a bit dry and a bit tough in my opinion.

The roganjosh was a little spicy on certain bites, but the other dishes weren't spicy yet had lots of flavor.

The delivery fee was a flat S$10 which I felt was very fair considering food panda and other food delivery places in Singapore would not allow deliveries as far away as our place in Sengkang.

I've also eaten at the restaurant once in person before and had vegetarian food with naan that time. The paneer butter masala and the daal we had were delicious and went very well with the naan.

The restaurant itself was relatively quiet, but we did see a lot of outbound deliveries."
Great Northern Indian Food,The food served at Aromas is excellent. I keep visiting them occasionally with family and friends. Great taste too. 😊 Their Gobi Manchurian is superb. Others don't come close.
Great food and service !,"Surprising, we have never dined in at aromas but, have been getting takeouts from here for years. The food is fabulous. Not too heavy, reasonably priced and finger lickin' good. We usually get our staple of paneer, bhindi and channa and they have never let us down. It has been consistently great. The service is equally amazing. The manager, Sam is super helpful, polite and always willing to go the extra mile. We have been getting home deliveries from from a while now and are glad they deliver island wide (at the time of writing this review). Highly recommended!"
Delicious Authentic North Indian Cuisine,"If you love authentic North Indian Cuisine, this is the place to go. The expertly prepared food is very authentic, and taste fantastic! You’ll definitely return for more! The service is excellent as well! Highly recommended!"
Drinks and food,Look the ambience and the service of the staff. Special shoutout to Sam.. He knows his stuff and recommends the right combos. Always feel welcomed here and good vibes.
OCC review of Aromas of India,"The Oakham Curry Club (OCC) is a well-respected Institution with multiple international
Franchises. Thus review of ‘Aroma of India – The sweet smell of success’ being the latest by our Singapore branch. The OCC takes pride in searching out the finest Indian restaurants and providing impartial reviews of Curry Houses all over the world.
Members vote anonymously without being influenced by other members (we call this “no
swaying”) on 5 categories, and an average score out of a maximum 10 is given to each
restaurant we review. For full transparency, see below scores (out of 10). The voting is based on the votes from OCC members. Restaurants must score an average of 7/10 or above to receive the OCC sticker of recommendation. All OCC members have been through a rigorous selection process to gain entry into the Club. In short, we all know our curries.

Aroma of India
Meet on the 27th August 2020: 60 Race Course Road. 218567
Quality: 7.67
Customer Care: 8.89
Value: 8.44
Service: 8.39
Atmosphere: 6.5
Overall: 7.98

Aroma of India IS AWARDED the OCC badge of recommendation with atmosphere the only score coming in below 7

“Aromas of India is a ""Theme Restaurant"" and our theme is ""Ultimate Client Satisfaction"".
A distinguishing feature of the Aromas of India is its bright, family atmosphere in the daytime, transforming into an elegant brasserie in the evening.”
Aromas of India had definitely nailed their colours to the mast that their theme is Ultimate Client Satisfaction so we went in expecting to be looked after.
First impressions of the restaurant itself – it is medium sized with plenty of space for socially distanced eating so no need to call the Korma Police on this lot. It is certainly brighter than most curry houses and actually quite chilly in there - not as cold as Singapore cinemas – but cold enough that a second layer or some trousers wouldn’t have gone a miss. Having said that the welcome we received on arrival was very warm and we were immediately made to feel at home.

“Poppadoms with THREE sauces and bonus onion bhajis today to set us off!”

“the provision of sauce with poppadoms was the best I've seen”
So we were off to a good start. The eagle eyed amongst us had eyed some beers taps but we were informed that they weren’t yet working. But the beers were soon flowing with regular rounds of cold bottles of Kingfisher arriving hastily at our table.

“My glass was never short of beer, felt like a free flow!”

Anyway soon enough the starters soon arrived comprising of Samosas and a sizeable non-veg platter which a good selection of meat and seafood. One of our quieter members (despite playing the drums) is a vegetarian so the platter was big enough for the remaining 4 of us to share.

“I thought the starter were great. Generous portions of samosas. Personally I’m not a huge fan of seafood tandoori but the rest of it was delicious”

“Tandoor platter was a bit dry apart from the lamb.”

On to mains which were Yellow Dal, Channa Masala, Chicken Tikka, Jhal Frazi, Butter Chicken, Lamb Vindaloo, Bhuna Gosht and a lot Garlic Naans.

“The curries were all spicy and delicious winners and the garlic naans were spectacular, maybe the best I’ve ever naan I’ve ever had.”

“Fantastic food. Incredible bread and vindaloo. I think maybe there was a bit of stinginess with the meat in the curries but a very very good meal.”

“Butter chicken was outstanding as were the naans.”

“Curries were OK, but a bit samey.”

By the end of the meal there was very little left on the table (except a stray green chilli) and we had all eaten our fill. In the past the OCC has been a little shocked when receiving the bills but on this occasion it was about $80 per head which with many beers included is excellent value and this is reflected in the scores.

“And then the bill was very reasonable.... Great great venue!”

As a club we want to give special praise to the staff who went over and above not only in terms of service but also customer care, one highlight being the provision of free shots to an esteemed member who had recently turned 40.

“The manager could not do enough for us service stood out here.“

“Very good service. Great customer care.”

“Customer Care better than the actual curry.”

“Very impressed. Service and customer care really stood out, though a bit suspicious that they knew what we were all about and stepped up their game. But after all we are the OCC and deserve nothing less!”

Final reflections on Aroma of India. The website claims that a guest is compared with the presence of God. Our chairman is actually convinced that God is a DJ which is why he couldn’t attend, instead opting to ‘chase the vibes’ on an 18-30s holiday in Ibiza. However I’m sure he will be disappointed to have missed this

“Although not a date night restaurant, if you’re looking for good food and great service you can’t really go wrong.”

“The customer care and value was pretty damn good for what was, all in a very decent curry. Not one for date night, but for a curry and a pint, I’m in!”

“What a tremendous curry house”"
Aromas - great food always!!,"My first time back to Aromas since the restrictions were lifted. Restaurant has been nicely refurbished and repainted - it looks more spacious now, but that may just be the social distancing requirement.

Food was excellent - had a mix of veggie and non veggie. Chicken malai kebab was absolutely fantastic. Loved it. The paneer tika was also excellent. Nice cheese and garlic naan bread and Tiger beer - had an excellent evening. Hope to be back soon.

Good working WiFi and air conditioning. Good ambiance."
Great dining place,Great service! Staffs are very attentive and friendly. Their prices are reasonable. Can try when u are in little India area!
Great Place in little India,Had Delicious food at little India Aromas of India. 3 beer bottles only $10 . Chicken tikka.naan crispy. Must try butter chicken. Cheers
Chill out... Or fine dinning,This place provides both.. I was there with a client just for beers we were served with nice spicy papadams and beer was fresh and value for the money. Been there alot of time and will never get bored of their food or their service.
Fantastic dinner,"I visited with a group of fellow curry-enthusiasts on Wednesday 3rd March 2020 . We had an absolutely fantastic evening - the food was incredibly good, diverse and delicious. We started with a generous array of papadums and breads being presented with various dips, then had several tasty appetizers: succulent and well-spiced lamb skewers, pakora and beautifully seared cauliflower with a range of sauces. Then came a feast of various curries and all were fantastic, but an absolute ""standout"" was the fish curry and the grilled prawns - sensational! Throughout our meal the staff were friendly, attentive and happy to share plenty of information on the food they were presenting to us. All in all a simply amazing night for curry lovers!"
Lunch,Was great very good food clean and fresh I will be back although I enjoy meat dishes I decided on the spinach paneer I’ve And garlic Naan they were delicious
Very nice lunch.,"We popped into this restaurant by chance at lunchtime, very pleasant staff and the food was superb. Chicken tika masala, beautiful garlic roti with rice.
Complimented with ice cold tiger beer, definately worth a visit."
Very Good Food at a Reasonable Price,"I recently ate lunch here and it was good enough that I want to share the fact with the world! :)
For the money, it is one of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore - the food was delicious, the service was friendly and my wallet wasn't emptied in the process! The tandoori lamb was delicious, the chicken jalfrezi was excellent (a tasty rich gravy with tender chicken chunks, etc.) and the saffron rice was light and fluffy and aromatic. I ate until I was stuffed and then a bit more - I'll be back!"
aromas of india food,it was amazing experience at aroma of india.. they are located in little india of singapore. there food is delious and staff is good and polite.. they have good tea...specially sam who treated us very politely and helpful too.. thanks Sam
Best Indian food in (Little India),after My class we decided to go Aromas of india . Delicious food and friendly service . Cheers 👌🏻 👌🏻
One of the beat curries we’ve ever had,"We found this Indian restaurant on trip advisor and we’re so glad we trusted the good reviews! The food here is amazing and there is so much selection, whether you are a meat eater or veggie. We’ve eaten a lot of curries whilst in Asia and this is definitely our favourite so far. Also great service with nice waiters. You need to check it out!"
Best curry I ever had.,I had an amazing time here all 8 people in my party was shocked about how good the food is. I can't pronounce the name of the food but I can say it was amazing
Yummy Food 😋,A perfect place for family gathering. Staffs were extremely friendly and the tandoor dishes were awesome. Worth the price for a good Indian cuisine. My favorite was paneer tandoor tikka - smoky
Great Lunch,"I try the same types of Indian dishes everywhere I travel. In this case the butter chicken and palak paneer. It was fantastic! The chicken still has that smokiness from the Tandor and overall I have nothing negative to say about anything I tried.

It was quite empty, which meant immediate service for anything I needed."
Indian 60race coast rd,"Score for the taste -kadai prawn 7.5 ,/10 ivan Tandoori chicken 9/10 my friend steve scored Naan 9/10 mango lassi 9/10"
"Good food, friendly staff, and a great meal. Definitely worth a visit.","It's a little hard to find, off the main area of Little India, but worth tracking down. The waiting staff were extremely friendly and helpful, although it was quiet on the evening of our meal, just one other big table. The food was good, although we'd have preferred everything more spicy. Well cooked and delicious, nothing over the top touristy, just tasty food basically presented in a quiet place perfect for family and friends to chat and enjoy. We'd. definitely re-visit for another meal in the future."
Wonderful place .... great,Wonderful place .... great food service best of the best ..... will go again n again for sure ...highly recommended..... Frieny staff ...
Excellent India in Little India,"A friend and I were exploring Little India and stopped by for lunch. It was relatively empty - they said their primary business is at dinner - and we had no problem getting a seat. It is not on the Main Street, but rather in a long line of Indian restaurants a block off. The decor is standard but one comes to an Indian restaurant for the food, and it does not disappoint. Between us we had samosas, chicken tikka, saag, garlic and Kashmiri naan, and mango lassis. Pappadaam was complimentary. Everything was tasty and in good portions. The server was friendly and prompt. The was an excellent meal!"
Satisfaction,We were lucky to arrive before the break time between the lunch and dinner times. Highest rated restaurant around in TA and we left highly satisfied. Would appreciate a little more spice but balance was good.
Great food and service,"Since discovering Aromas of India I have been enjoying the delicious food here every time I visit Singapore. The Chicken Tikka and the Kashmiri Naan are very tasty. I tried the Lamb Biryani last time and was not disappointed. The quality of the produce used in the kitchen is extremely high.
The service is always prompt and polite, and the staff are very professional.
I’m looking forward to my next visit this weekend !"
The Best!,"This was the best food. Great variety. Freshly prepared and cooked. Excellent service from Mr Sam who went above and beyond including taxi flagging and generous beverage service.
A small restaurant with a big heart and soul. Highly recommended.
A firm favourite of all six diners."
Very nice dinner place,We enjoyed a very nice dinner here with my friends. The food was tasty and the service was great! Recommend!
Overrated,"We walked into a restaurant with a smell that was so bad. Food, starters average rating, non vege items for main dish, espeo butter chicken masala was bad, uncooked chicken pieces, my kids just didn't like it. They only enjoyed one prawns dish. Vege items was average only. Nothing was really good that you will remember or recommend. Just over rated... Our bad, wrong choice."
Dinner with family,"The place was easy to find and we were met with a lovely and broad smile of the manager, Sam.
We ordered food on his recommendation and all met with our expectations - good food, good ambiance, good service and overall, a fantastic way to have dinner with family."
Happy customer for more than 5 years,i m a regular customer for Aromas of India for more than 5 years. Quality of the food still remains the same. It s a favorite dining spot for my Non Indian colleges also.
Family dinner,"4 of us went out for tea.
We had tomato soup and samosas for starters. And shared mains of pepper chicken, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo and aloo Gobi. Also 3 different nann breads. Could not fault a single thing. The food was fantastic. The waiter was a lovely bloke who was easy to chat too and very professional and ambitious about his work. Would definatly go back and recommend to everyone."
Thoroughly enjoyable experience.,"We looked at lots of Indian restaurants but my partner said"" lets eat here ,it looks cozy"". She was right but the food was excellent too and the service was spot on and sincere. Highly recommended."
AMAZING FOOD,Loved the vegetarian menu and food. Breads are the best as very soft and fresh. Starter and main course is good too. Price is reasonable and service is very nice. I did catering too for my son's birthday party and all guests loved the food. Strongly recommended.
MUST VISIT!! FOOD IS AMAZING!,"I visited twice in 2 days with my partner. Sam is so kind and the perfect host.
My partner is a chef and is very particular about food and we both loved it.

We tried so many dishes and all were just perfect. Our favourite was the butter chicken the best we’ve ever had.

Definitely go you won’t be disappointed."
Take away order for 25pax.,"Organised a family gathering and Aromas of India has always been our first choice for Indian food.
We had Butter Chicken, Fish Tikka, Aloo Gobi, Palak Paneer, Naan and Rice. Food was fantastic, very flavorful and everyone loved it.
Solid restaurant, good and reasonable prices. Will often come back."
KIND PEOPLE AND WILL BE BACK !! :),"Shout out to the man who took a picture of me and my girlfriend, we will definitely go back here. We will never forget this experience."
Best buttered chicken,First trip to Singapore went to Little India found this restaurant on trip advisor with great reviews. Not disappointed lived the buttered chicken abd garlic naan. Want tot ake the buttered chicken home to Perth!!
Meh,"We came after reading the reviews. Even though it was empty we went in. The food was very ordinary, I can get better in small town NZ! Zero ambience. Service was good but as I said before there was no one there."
The only Indian we patron,Living next to Little India one is spoilt for choice. After years of restaurant hopping we found Aromas. For six years we have pretty much only eaten here. Why? Not because we are boring or lack adventure just everywhere else disappoints. Sam is always a pleasure to talk to - great host. Food is consistently very tasty.
"Food is great, Service is even better!","I loved the food like many other Indian restaurants, but the service stood out the most. The owner/manager was incredibly nice to us. The seating area is also nice."
"Best food,service,people😁",Amazing food. Best north indian food i have had in little india. Service level is perfect. Always felt great dining at aromas of india for all events.
Better go somewhere else,"Went there because of the good reviews. The experience was just very disappointing.

No nice atmosphere, if it would not have smelled of toilet, the interior would have been also not better or more cozy.

The food was nothing special, I had much better butter chicken in other restaurants. We were asking ourself if they just warmed the food up."
Good food and service,One of scores of Indian restaurants along Racecourse Rd. Friendly efficient service and very good food in a simple but basic setting.
Try the butter chicken and garlic naan!,"Do consider this restaurant when in little India! The butter chicken is nice and tender; the garlic naan is really really good! Most importantly, the service is good and the staff are really friendly :) will definitely come here again!"
Dinner,"We ordered a Fish Tikka, Palek Paneer without the cheese, Tandoor Broccoli Garlic Naan and not forgetting cold beer.
The food comes up to mark. The Tandoor broccoli served with mint sauce is not commonly found and it has become one of our favourites. Kudos to the staff who will always make menu suggestions."
Delicious,"We ordered vegetable kebab and chilli chicken starters, and chicken vindaloo and chicken jalfrezi as mains with a side of garlic naan.
All absolutely delicious!
Service was fast and friendly, even though they had a busy night.
We had no reservation but they were able to quickly give us a table outside.

We’ll definitely be back!"
Good service and tasty food,Very clean and tidy. Good service. Staffs are friendly. Very tasty food especially tandoori chicken and methi fish
What a nice surprise!,"My trophy and girlfriend and I stopped in one evening on a trip from Atlanta to Formula 1. What a nice surprise! Much better than any Indian food we've had in the states. Authentic! Our server was very engaging and helpful answering our questions. Sit outside if you can, and watch the people go by. Really cool!."
Well well well,"Being German this is not realy my kind of food but being led by my wife to this place I thought I give it a go. Walking into the restaurant first impressions are.... Let's get back out, very basic, decor not amasing and a slight smell of damp.... well let's trust TripAdvisor.... Starters arrived and all doubt was gone (considering we were the only 2 people in the place)..... mains got served and well well well I might have just fallen in love with Indian food ❤️❤️
If you want a fancy place with expensive food don't bother coming here. If you want great food this is the place to go"
Lunch,We ordered varieties of food today. However i must say that your food quality and taste standards have gone down tremendously!!! Very disappointed. I have patronised a few times over the years and the food tasted really good and thats why we came back again today. Freshlime soda tasted horrible. The food taste was totally flat!!! The garlic naans were burnt on the sides and was served n it was not soft but hard and so are the butter naans.
The best and most authentic Indian dining and professional catering experience in Singapore.,"As the name suggests, Aromas of India offers the most authentic food , flavors and rich aromas from different parts of India. They offer a wonderful in house dining experience with an extensive menu. I am a big fan of their chhola bhatura and chicken jalfrezi. Even the desserts are absolute delicacies.
We have also expereienced their highly professional catering service. They customise catering menus as per customer requirement and our guests have always been full of praises for the delicious food, clean and beautiful buffet set up that they do. Always on time and very professional , cooperative and friendly staff. The Ras Malai in their catering menu is the best I have ever tried..Its an absolute melt in the mouth with a very distinctive fragrant and delicious taste. What sets apart Aromas of India from others is their amazing food at the most reasonable and competetive prices accross Singapore.
In short...its complete value for money...best of food...best of service ...best of memories...best of happy customers."
"Highly highly recommended, Excellent food!","I stay in Singapore and I've been visiting this restaurant for over 5 years now.

To start with, you get complimentary papads and chutney. Service is good and the prices are quite reasonable. Location is convenient as well.

Restaurant manager, Sam, is a great guy. We have to get our order customized as some of my family members won't eat garlic or spicy food, and with Sam around, its easy to get this done.

Every time my parents are here from India, they insist on going to this restaurant. We have tried a few other north Indian restaurants but nothing beats this place when it comes to having dinner with my family.

I have stopped counting the no. of times I have visited this restaurant or how many occasions we've celebrated here. Will continue to visit this place as long as I'm here in Singapore.

Must try: Paneer butter masala, Chilly Paneer, Garlic naan."
Nice quiet restaurant in Little India,We liked the athmosphere in Little India but chose for dinner a more quiet place and were really happy about it!:) The food was good and we even got an ice-cream for free!
Excellent food and fantastic service,"We had a family meal at Aromas of India and loved it. The food was excellent, especially the butter chicken and the naan bread. Everything was cooked so well and served with a smile. The host was very friendly and looked after us well.
Thanks for looking after us."
"Well done Aromas of India…..Great food, Excellent service, Fantastic Experience... Indian food for International palate.","Thank you Aromas of India…..Great food, Excellent service, Fantastic Experience... Indian food for International palate... I am a regular guy here for more than 9 years. It’s not just my personal favorite fine-dining spot with a family...I have invariably taken my every guest from India or rest of the world here and always seen them enjoying and praising the food and service, though I get the credit as host, I sincerely think its Sam the manager and Chef deserves it. I had always appreciated the food and service here which is evident from my 9 years for loyalty but I never wrote a review until now when we had a party at home and tried their catering service... we had around 25 guests, Indians, French, Korean, Americans wanted them to try Indian food... everyone liked it so very much...butter chicken and garlic nan was everyone’s favorite and I could see that every relished on Peas Palav and Punjabi Dhal tadka equally…food was served piping hot, on time and very good portion to satisfy all. I can vouch that this the best value for money fine dining or catering and be assured that your guests will not go back without asking about the caterer... which made me write this short review to thank Aromas of India… Well done Aromas for India.. Thank you once again Sam and Team….you never let me down, whenever I brought my guests to your place or now when we hosted a party at home... Good Job! ! !"
Delicious Butter Chicken and best naan bread I’ve ever had!,Superb service and absolutely delicious food. Highly recommend! Staff were very friendly. Delicious butter chicken with the best garlic cheese naan we have ever eaten. If you’re looking for Singapore’s best Indian this is the place to visit
Great Indian food,Ate there for lunch on a hot weekday while in town for tourism. The AC worked great and we were seated right away. The menu was diverse and we all agreed that the food was very good. The service was also quick and friendly - we enjoyed getting to know our server (can’t remember his first name but know his last name was Singh). Go go go!
Amazing,i am still sat at the table after finishing my food and was so happy with my food and service I had to write a review. Would defiantly recommend. (You only need half a rice)
Always great...,"I've been dining here for years with my fiancee and we love it! Sam, the Operations Manager always makes us feel right at home with a warm smile and great service. The food is always awesome, if you have a craving for Indian food, this is where you should go to satisfy it.

I'll definitely recommend the Tandoori Jhinga (juicy grilled prawns with lots of spices) and the creamy butter chicken.

Can't wait to be back!"
Methi Fish is the highlight of this restaurant,"This restaurant has the best Methi Fish one has to offer.. Having it along with their Garlic Naans, will bring you to cloud 9.. I always end up ordering more and more of the Methi Fish.. Well spices and Excellent Naans here.

Great to know that this restaurant is listed on Deliveroo so that you can satisfy your cravings for Naan and Methi Fish.. :)"
Great food,"The restaurant itself is very basic and casual. Some tables outside, most tables inside. Inside the TV was playing loud and the lights are very blie and cold. The food was great! Very tasty, good ingredients. Fast and efficient service."
Beautiful meal,"We wanted a nice good priced Indian meal in little India. We chose to go here after reading reviews for places in the area. The restaurant had good air conditioning this was vital as we went for lunch. As we ordered the waiter helped us decide by giving suggestions. We were not disappointed. We had two mains, two rice and a naan all of which was tasty. At the end of the meal we were given a vanilla ice cream to cleanse the pallet. Such a good touch and lovely way to end the meal. I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a decent priced indian meal."
Awesome service and great food.,The service was fantastic. The butter chicken was terrific! I would definitely recommend this place.
Excellent,"Friendly staff, plenty of Indian locals eating here, food served quickly. We had samosas (amongst the best samosas I’ve ever had), paneer/spinach curry and a king prawn curry with butter and garlic naans and cold beers. Completely delicious and more than enough for 2 adults. Free ice cream for desert. Absolutely nothing negative to say about our visit here."
Delicious Cusine.,"I visited this restaurant during my visit to Singapore with a family group of 25 pax.
I was staying at Orchard road but for all my meals we visited Aromas of India because of its taste and hospitality.

They even deliver at your hotel which was unique and excellent show of hospitality.

I would recommend it for Indian food lovers.

All staff members were great and thanks to everyone."
"Simple decor, tasty food","We were wandering Little India with a complaining 13-yr-old, so rather than eat at the Tekka Market stalls, we decided to sit down in a calm restaurant. Saturday lunch it was just us and a table of old Singaporian Chinese guys drinking whiskey. Decor is super basic but the food (butter naan, palak paneer, butter chicken, lime sodas) was delicious. A bonus, to our surprise, was tasty chocolate ice cream on the house. Certainly more expensive than the hawker market, but we would go back and try more dishes."
Our go to place to take our guest,"Aromas of India is our go to place to take our guests for dinner.
Last weekend we took our guest from Delhi to Aroma's of India.
The decor is simple but quality of food & service is always top class.
We ordered Tandoori Chicken. Unlike Red / Orangish colored Tandoori Chicken they serve fresh chicken that does not or probably has minimal coloring. Tandoori chicken was well up , juicy and soft.

For Veg starters we ordered Chilli Mushroom & Gobhi Manchurian. These are our perennial favorites and these two starters seldom fail to live up to their expectations.
Both are mildly spicy and you can always tell Sam to moderate or increase the spice level. Both starters were tasty.

We ordered main course only after finishing the starters so that main course remains warm & fresh. This week we ordered Malai Kofta with specific instruction to make it bit spicy , Kadahi Prawn's for our friends from Delhi & Chicken Tikka Malasa with Garlic Naans.
Every table of the restaurant was occupied on Saturday nigh still the we did not had to wait too long for the food to arrive on the table & food quality was excellent. I would highly recommend Aromas of India"
Highly hyped place not worth the good rating,"I went there after seeing the good review in TripAdvisor. I was really shocked to visit this place. The place was lacking any ambience, and when we were offered a table it did not even have mats on the table (see attached photograph). The service was also pathetic. My daughter dropped the green chutney by mistake and throughout our eating time in the restaurant it was never cleaned. The waiter just put a tissue paper on it (see attached photograph). We had to even ask for tissue paper. The staff was not welcoming at all. Never been subjected to such bad service in any restaurant before.

The food was also extremely ordinary, absolutely not highly rated as I see here. There are a bunch of restaurant on the same street with food quality and taste as good as this.

I would request TripAdvisor to re-look at the rating or the source of this good rating as I guess it is doctored."
Superb,"SimPly awesome the food. The spiciness, the aroma, the taste, the flavours all is superb good. Thank you so much for making my day."
Delicious Gem,Some of the best Indian food I have had and a great find in Little India. Owner was kind and made the experience top notch.
A Yummy Father's Day Dinner,"My family and I visited Aromas of India on Father's Day as my dad is a big fan of Indian food and his friend had previously recommended the restaurant.

The manager, Sam was very welcoming and provided us with suggestions without being pushy. Through his suggestions, we were able to sample a variety of carbs and protein.

The food amazing, especially the butter chicken and garlic naan. I was worried about the lamb dish as I am sensitive towards the smell in general, but it was very well cooked and tender. In addition, we had fragrant bryani rice, ladies fingers and prawns, which were all very delicious without being cloying.

The servings were just enough for 4 pax and very reasonably priced for a proper restaurant with good AC, decent bathroom and professional service.

Overall, an outstanding experience and highly recommend Aromas of India!"
Jason williams,"Recommend this takeaway,lamb vindaloo lovely and tender.Have ordered 2 times so far on are stay here.Garlic nan lovely to."
LOVE THIS PLACE,Amazing food and service! Will definitely recommend this place to anyone! Staff were really friendly and genuine.
A must visit for anyone wanting Indian food,Excellent experience. Good amount of choice in the menu. Food was halal. The owner was very friendly and gave us 4 pints of beer on the house. Food was very tasty. We’re also given complimentary ice cream at the end as well. If you want Indian food in Singapore you must go here!
Aromatic experience,Good food and ambience Roch delicious well priced food with good service Adequate space to sit can be crowded on weekends
Fantastic Jalfrezi,"Myself and my husband have just arrived in Singapore today from Hong Kong where we really struggled with the food. So decided to play safe and take some advise of trip advisor.
We went for this Indian in little India
And it really didn’t disappoint
Staff were very welcoming and friendly
Nice greeting when we walked in
Food came quick and was Devine
Would defiantly recommend and would eat there again
Also very reasonably priced"
Fantastic!,"Just what I hoped for. Not busy, fast service, great butter chicken and for a good price. Next door to the competition Banana and therefore a little bit hard to find!! Enjoy."
"Perfect dinner, and very good value","Superfriendly owner, great food and a free beer :) We could not choose from the dishes, so we ordered 2 starters and 2 mains, all of them were perfect! and that was a feast! Very tasty Indian food, big portions (it was an all you can eat type of experience :) we were not hungry until the next afternoon. We were craving for good Indian food in Singapore, after having left the Philippines a bit disappointed foodwise, and left completely satisfied. Thank you!"

Great tasty Indian food,We have enjoyed great authentic Indian food. Speacilly must try butter chicken and Motton Rogan josh.
Great find,Was on a walk about in little India on a hot Sunday afternoon. Detoured into Aromas of India for lunch. Great service and food. Had the chicken jalfrezi and it was top notch. Not to mention the cheese Naan. Would eat here again.
Excellent food and friendly service!,It's a must to visit here if you want an authentic North Indian cuisine. Atomsphere is nice and service is perfect.. Thumbs Up!!!!

Fantastic food!,Very authentic indian food and very friendly people! We liked the ambiente and the location. We were really happy and highly recommend this place!
Fantastic taste of little India!!,"We went as a pair of friends, and the staff is extremely friendly, very welcoming and helpful with spice levels since we were Canadian, so it was perfect for Our taste.

Everything about the food was yummy, and a really good price. I would highly recommend, and would go back again!

Atmosphere is perfect."
Very good,"Second time here, first review.

A bit apprehensive as there was no-one there for a Saturday lunch at 12.30. Need not have worried as the food and service was excellent.
We had Paneer Butter Masala which was amazing, Aloo Gobi, Channa Masala, which were great and the Fish Tikka which was a little dry but nevertheless tasty.
Only downside was waiting 20 minutes for the Masala tea.
We will definitely be back."
Delicious north Indian food !!!,"Hi, I would highly recommend aromas of India for it's authentic north Indian taste and Mr. Sam for his fantastic hospitality. Had chicken Tikka with beer and it taste so good. Would definitely be there for next time when I will be in Singapore!!"
Surprisingly delicious,Maybe some of the best Indian food I’ve ever had. The tandoori chicken which is often dry at other places was moist and tender. The butter chicken and Tikka masala was also delicious. The host also graciously offered us free wine and beer and sent us off with free water bottles. Would highly recommend
Greetings from the hotel toilet,"Well, after seeing the dirt on the wals, heavy dust and the overall odd first impression we decided to give them a try due to the good ratings.

Long story short - great naan, great califlower, friendly waiter but overall its worth 3-4 stars.

Considering I keep running to the bathroom, Im ot sure anymore about the hygene A rating..."
Fantastic service and amazing Indian food,"Even though we where a bit scared of at first since the whole restaurant was empty we did not regret our visit to ’Aromas of India’ . Maybe they are in the higher price range (do not know) but for me it does not get much better then this! We had the Butter chicken and Palak paneer and was amazed by the genuine North Indian flavours. Amazing Naan aswell. A place to revisit! Great service and friendly/homey feel to the staff. If there is something to remark on is that we did not get any ice in the water - but that is the only remark I can make. Great place, great food!"
Great service and food,We stopped in for dinner. Both the food and service were great. The lamb melts in your mouth. Low key and unpretentious. Highly recommend.
