Delicious but can be better,"I love Quentin's food but the quality of the food is beginning to go down. For example, the oxtail debal used to be fall of the bone tender, the one we had last week was tough and chewy; we also had the fretu kangkong and it just felt like sadness in a plate. The pineapple prawn curry was nice though. Will I revisit? I will because I do like my Eurasian food and Quentin remains the best in spite of its shortcomings."
Wasted Trip.,"Food was expensive, service was slow, cob webs on the ceiling fans, insects on the tables, waiters looking lost, etc. Zero effort in promoting the Eurasian food and culture. Emphasis was more on promoting the 1-for-1 happy hour drinks. The only saving grace was the live band."
Food is simply great!,"We live near Quentin's for almost 20 years but never stepped in. So last weekend we decided to do so and we were wowed! The food was simply fantastic. We loved the curry oxtail debal, feng, prawn bastador (we added one more order of it), creamy vegetables, grilled baramundi....the list goes on. The live band and 1-for- beer added to the fun although we were seated too close to the band. The manager was extremely helpful. He tried to find us another table because of our toddler and the loud music but the place was full house that night. We are definitely going back!"
Unfortunate,"Food took almost an hour, including kids meal that came AFTER the main dishes. Drinks took a long time as well, no care was given to serve the children earlier. No apologies for late service, blamed the technology that order did not go through but when prompted, they were able to get our orders through system - very dubious response. Food for children was extremely peppery, not suitable for kids.

Absolutely unpleasant experience, with zero attention to customers despite it being in a premium location.

Kids playground had me itching after too - not sure if cleaned proper.

Not recommended for families."
Dinner at Quentin's,"Saw the restaurant featured on youtube so decided to try it and especially the devil curry since there was so much hype about it. However, the dining experience was ok, I guess. Started off well with the fish crackers that went very well with the sambal chili and best part is it's free! Hardly any restaurants will offer free appetizers :) The devil curry - signature dish was overly spicy such that we couldn't taste the spices well. The other dishes we ordered - beef rendang - much better, meat cutlets - ok and the chicken stew had some bugs in it so the dish was removed from the bill after we told the staff about it. We ordered dessert but the wait was too long so we decided no to have it. Prices on the steep side. The staff was nice and service was fine. Worth the experience if you have never tried Eurasion cusine before."
Dinner at Quentins,"The manager upon receiving me in, was so unfriendly and the tine of his voice was terrible! But when I was seated, the waiter, David knew of my discontentment, he apologized and after which he made my dinner throughout the night a very pleasant one. Kudos, to David! He is awesome in handling the situation!"
Unique dishes you won't find at other restaurants,"Known for serving up Eurasian fare, Quentin's is the place to go to if you would like to have a taste of some unique dishes like pang susi, feng and curry debal. Besides the Eurasian noodles that was too salty for us, the other dishes that we ordered – fish bostador, patchri, pang susi – were delectable. Even the sambal chilli that we had with the keropok delivered a spicy kick that my companion and I loved."
Always a Pleasure!,"The quality of the food - Debol Curry & Cabbage preparation, especially - was as delicious as every. The service remains welcoming and comforting, even as freshly minted staff member, David, took very good care of us."
Great food and ambience,Did not know what to expect when I booked the restaurant but the food was very good. DEfinitely would visit again.
Service not ideal,"This is my first time and frankly was disappointed with your service. From the reviews I read before I went, I thought it’s be more family friendly vibe.

When I asked for food recommendation, the server ask me to read and look at the most trending food via the QR quote while the other server didn’t revert back to me as he was too busy.

I seriously don’t think this should be the service at all. Quite disappointing."
Authentic heritage cuisine,"Quentin's does Eurasian food right. Everything was delicious, and the restaurant has a cosy ambience."
Great ambience and closes early,Great place to chillout with group of friends but go early as the restaurant gets crowded and closes early ard 9pm. Food is nicely presented
Easter buffet,Quentin’s is a warm and welcoming family restaurant. Food is authentic and they do not compromise on quantity or quality even when the restaurant is busy and packed as it was at lunchtime on a Sunday. Staff are sincere and helpful. A great experience
Delicious Eurasian Food,"Great dining place if you want to discover delicious Eurasian cuisine like Pasteis de Bacalhau, Prawn Bostador and Curry Debal Oxtail. Value for money, relaxed ambience, great service. Definitely recommend!"
Something different but authentic and good value,"We have patronized Quentin's at Sentosa, so thought will try the other restaurant at Ceylon Road. The place is inside Eurasian Club and has pleasant ambience. Items on the menu are not the usual ones, so tried Ox-tail Devil's curry, crispy pork, chicken stew, chap chye, and of course desserts. Food was tasty and enough for 4-5 persons, but desserts were a bit disappointing, too sweet for chendol and no taste for gula melaka. The restaurant takes it's last order at 8pm, and closes at 9pm, thought it was a bit too early as customers were still coming in at 8+. Overall good foody experience."
Good Eurasian Food,The food at Quentin's were great. The atmosphere was pleasant and my family enjoyed the lunch. I would recommend.
Good food in charming location,"We were disappointed that the sugee cake as sold out but otherwise found the service attentive, food tasty and the restaurant very hospitable. Keep it up!"
Wonderful Valentines Dinner,Bostador was amazing!!! A definite must have! The staff was wonderfully friendly and the ambience was excellent for the evening! I really really love the place and we'll definitely be bringing our family back for the next visit!
Great unique eurasian food,"This is the 1st time i am eating eurasian food. tastes like Peranakan food but has its unique dishes as well. Regular devil's curry was already quite spicy, cannot imagine the extra spicy one. Other dishes are not so spicy. The ambience was nice and the service was good. Names of dishes were nothing i have seen before. Overall good food and portion is decent."
Cosy and delicious food,Nice place to catch up with friends. Food is great. Authentic peranakan and eurasian food. Love the ambience too.
Nice ambience with friendly service,"I always enjoy the friendly service, especially from Steven, when I visit this restaurant. This time, I ordered chicken devil's curry. I found that I prefer the oxtail devil's curry I had previously."
Amazing food. Very impressed,"1. The food was excellent. It was our first time trying out this cuisine, and we loved it. I got my friend to order a whole bunch of stuff, and we really liked it. Dishes that impressed us: Keluar Fried Rice, Pasteis de Bacalhau, Curry Debal Oxtail, Fish Bostador, Sugee Cake, Chap Chye, Kueh Salat & Ginkli Nona.

Everything was outstanding except the Chap Chye, which paled in comparison to all the other great dishes.

We ordered a bit too much for 3 pax, 4 would have been perfect. It was good value for money for the food and experience.

Service was average, they were a little busy on Saturday night and was struggling to keep up with the orders. I had to chase up on my drink and dessert before they were served.

I love the chill and relaxed atmosphere. Nothing fancy or pretentious. Just good food and chill vibes. 11/10 will return."
Great food,"Food is really good and enjoyable, portion is good. The oxtail devil’s curry is a must order dish.

Be patient as the food takes quite a while to come. It’s a small restaurant with air con and non air con seatings. The wine list is quite sad."
Good service and good food,"I think the food was really good and I loved it a lot. It was definitely a bit on the pricier side but was more affordable when using Burpple. The service was great as well as the service staff was attentive, obliging and light hearted."
Casual Eurasian Fare,Lovely neighbourhood restaurant serving Eurasian food. Especially loved the Dry Laksa and Prawn Curry. Just the right amount of spice. Casual vibes with option of outdoor seating too. Service staff was really friendly as well!
Delicious Eurasian fare,"The food here was really good, especially the prawn bostador and oxtail debal curry with baguette. Atmosphere was relaxing and service was great too. I'm not familiar with Eurasian cuisine so trying these dishes was a memorable experience and having their sugee cake for dessert was a good way to end the meal. Would love to come back!"
A Tale of 2 Quentins’s,"Quentins’s at both Locations- Barracks Hotel@Sentosa; EA Community House @ Ceylon Road serve quintessentially Eurasian fare ! Both menus are super good , depending if you are on a “ date night” or family night out !

However when i crave for familiar Eurasian home cooking done to peerless perfection ( like my late mum’s) we head for Quentin’s @ Ceylon Road ... The must must try - Devil Curry with Bacon hock; Buah keluak with Pork spare ribs; Prawn Boustador; Cottage ( beef) pie with lashings of mashec potato on top!

The Sugee cake with Marzipan l icing n tea/ coffee are the perfect meal enders"
Amazing Sunday afternoon Eurasian meal,"Sunday afternoon my wife made a reservation for 2 pax at the Sentosa outlet, our experience was just amazing from the arrival to the table to the order taking and finally the food quality and the service, all was impeccable. Despite little staffing and the rainy ambiances the team and the chef personally put up an impressive lunch. Kudos to Quentin's we will be back, keep up the great job!"
Food & Service equals a Warm Hug,"In these uncertain times, my wife and I find comfort at Quentin's Eurasian Restaurant.
Not sure if it the refining of our taste buds, the food is ever-increasingly delicious. We had the all time favourite 'Curry Devil', Fried Kangkong, Sugee Cake with wine. All were of the highest quality.
Unfortunately, missing was the 'live band'."
60th Birthday Lunch,"The food was great and the service wonderful . We missed the nighttime band, since we went at lunchtime, but still we had a great time."
Excellent,"My husband and I have had 2 superb meal in Quentin’s and the staff were excellent. I would highly recommend anyone coming to Sentosa to give it a try, I am sure they will not be disappointed."
Food & music for the Soul,"My wife and I have been patronising Quentin's for years. Inevitable this is our number one choice when it comes to couple-only dining away from our children especially during special occasions like anniversaries and Valentine's Day. Just like our very first experience, the mouth-watering Eurasian fare continues in the excellent tradition.
An added bonus is the nostalgic music provided by the resident band 'The Music Men' (Thu - Sun).
Food and Music to nourish the soul and lead it on a dance."
A real quiet & quaint area...We loved it!!!,"This was to be a reward dinner for our team and rewarded we were from the yummy dishes of Quentins.
We all never had Eurasian food before but, oh my...it was really good!!!
Most of us love the oxtail Devil's curry...while the Black ink squid, Singing Serani & Kristang filled our tummies delightlfully :)
Special mention to the server, a really cheerful Indian lady, who ensured what we wanted and needed are attended to :)
That included finding a last piece Sugee cake for us all to try...many thanks!!!

This a great place to eat with families or even business associates...the live band outside will ensure the mood is set in place...
can't wait to come here again!"
Christmas Lunch,As usual the food at Quentin’s did not disappoint but unfortunately due to the Christmas Day lunch and the crowd the service was very slow. We waited for over an hour for our food.
Awesome food ! Great staff,Awesome food ! Great staff ! Peaceful location! Best to bring groups here as portion is for 2-3 pax ! Adequately priced as well !
Skinny Chef,"Don't be fooled, but this is the moniker of Chef de Cuisine Quentin Pereira of Quentin's Eurasian Restaurant in Singapore. You sometimes wonder how he remains so trim and slim in spite of the deliciously wonderful Kristang dishes he whips up in the kitchen! Starting with his original restaurant located in the Eastern part of Singapore Quentin has upped the ante and just recently opened Quentin's Bar & Restaurant housed in the newly refurbished Mess Hall next to Village Hotel on Sentosa. It's obvious that much thought has been spent on the decor as it oozes classy colonial charm in shades of dark greys blacks and whites - very befitting for a restaurant with Asian and European heritage. And of course the food did not disappoint - in Quentin's skillful hands, trademark classic Eurasian dishes are prepared to perfection and you are always wanting more. I was part of a private party when I was there, but I went through their menu and the must try dishes would be their classics like Fried Devilled Wings, Singgang Serani, Galinhia Keluak Curry and of course the all time favourite Debal Curry. And no meal would be complete without their mouth-watering desserts of Sugee Cake and Banana Fritters served with goodness-gratifying gula melaka ice cream. All in all Quentin's is the perfect place to bring your friends, family, overseas guests and even for those on their first dates, there are very cosy 2 seater tables for that romantic dinner."
Always a delight at Quentin's!,"The atmosphere at Quentin's adds to the good food, which we've enjoyed on several visits. Was there in early November, when the family celebrated my birthday. It was a Saturday night and the place was packed.
Great old-time songs from the resident band and a homely feel to the restaurant will keep us coming back.
Errol"
Bring your family here,"Located in Eurasian Association, it was not the most convenient place unless you stay in the east but hey, just drive or grab your way there! On certain days, be entertain with oldies by the band. Food reminded me of childhood with friendly staff to give you that homely feeling. Parents- there’s a mini playground in the restaurant to give you temporary relief & enjoy the food"
Great atmosphere so so food,"Visited with party of 7 adults and a kid
Cons:
We waited at least 30 mins before the 1st dish arrived. Strange as one would have thought fried chicken wings was something very fast to cook.
Most or if not all the dishes were either salty or sweet. Perhaps this is uniquely Eurasian?
The meat in the Semur and Babi Assam was tough and hard to chew.
Prices are a tad on the high side and $5 for a cup of coffee is a rip off!
They should also change their ice cream supplier as the Cookies & Cream was served lumpy and hard.
Pros:
Great place of families and couples as there are 2 separate dining areas.
Lovely play area filled with wonderful selection of toys and ball pitch for the young ones to be sufficiently entertained.
Service is attentive and kudos to the servers. Hard to come across such level in Singapore.
Water is served in pitches and you get non stop refill. Good gesture as most establishments do not offer without asking.
We ordered 10 different dishes and the only recommended ones are the Pasteis de Bacahlau, Oxtail Stew and Pineapple Prawn Curry.

Would we go back? Well only for the atmosphere and the play area."
Good food as always,"Tried different fare from our usual debal curry. The oxtail and bostador was good too. Nice starters - meat balls, cod cakes."
Always a Pleasure!,"My wife and I are regulars here. The reason we are regulars is that the restaurant is able to maintain a very high standard in evey department, which is an incredibly difficult thing to do. The food is always mouth-wateringly delicious (though the portions may be getting a tad smaller). When we ask for a dish with less oil, it DOES come with less oil. The service is friendly and personal, the atmosphere welcoming and the music - the live band - stirs the heart and mind and inspires the body to move. Plus the selection of wine completes the memorable experience each time. This is a place my wife and I will keep returning to at regular intervals!"
QUENTIN'S BEST,Had lunch with my cousins and friend and Quentin didn't disappoint yet again. Love the Bacalau patties. Even my cousins who are Eurasians were bowled over. Will definitely return
Kristang home cooked food,"Went on a Saturday and they had a live band playing plenty of songs from yesteryear. Super friendly staff with an ancient maître d’hôtel who tells heaps of daggy dad jokes. If you are after Kristang /Eurasian home cooked food, this is the place to be. Patrons looked like they have been coming here for years. They apparently have the best sugee cake in Singapore. We tried some and yes they were awesome ... maybe a tad more brandy would take it to the next level. If you are too full to have desert, you can take a block home. They sell the cakes and their condiments at the bar."
Always have a good time here,"Atmosphere is great, not many places where you can get dinner with live bands and those places that do have a band make conversation impossible, this is the perfect balance"
yummilicious food,I met with a friend for dinner. We were not disappointed as the meal was delicious. The best dish was the prawn and pineapple curry. It was a unique combination. Will definitely be back again.
Quentin's restaurant,"Very good service and food, there are musicians th ere... Eurasian cuisine. The foods were delicious. The ambience is perfect."
Better than expected,The appetiser with 2 types of chilli sambal was good. Portions were generous and overall food was fresh and delicious.
"Homely, Hearty, Heavenly","My partner had tried this place some years back and suggested for us to have lunch here last Sunday.

I had been looking through some online reviews and had zoomed in on some dishes which I’d like to sample.

We ordered the Pasties de Bacahlau at the recommendation of a friend who was also having lunch with her family at the restaurant. It was very interesting. What also piqued my interest was the salt fish pickle which came as one of the dips for the keropok starter we ordered. Loved it so much I had to bring a jar of the aromatic paste home.

The Prawn Bostador was flavourful and studded with crunchy, fresh prawns. The Curry Debal has the addition of vinegar, which was a refreshing change from the usual lemak, coconut milk based curries we’re used to. We wished it was spicier though.

We ended the meal with a slice of sugee cake and salted caramel lava cake with vanilla bean ice cream. The sugee cake was divine and well-executed. The latter was a new take on the more typical chocolate lava cake and tantalised our tastebuds."
Not a bad experience for a third time visit,"Went for a friday dinner with family and my baby. Overall experience is as pleasant as the previous 2 times. Food was ok (haha i feel we chose the wrong food), band is still singing nice songs abeit repetitive of the songs sang during our previous 2 visits. Surrounding was quite noisy as there was a company holding their thank you dinner on that night. Would have given full marks if:
1. Servers’ service was ok. Would have been better if there was someone who can recommend their dishes which they are proud of (order was done during an ipad, maybe a star next to popular dishes would be good)
2. During all 3 visits (haha we love the place so much that we went 3 times in 3 months!), we cant really hear ourselves talking even though we were seated inside the rest. Maybe the rest can improve their sound proofing for indoor seating.
3. Music was kind of repetitive by the band. Maybe a change in the songs they sang?

Having Dinner at Quentin restaurant is still overall an pleasant experience with its homely ambience and friendly and efficient servers. Keep improving!"
good restaurants,"Very good food and service. Good ambience. Good music. Easy to park your car,Very friendly waiters. Good value."
Quentin's is our go-to place for a great meal!,"As a Eurasian, finding good Eurasian food can be a daunting endeavour. Unless you have a grandma who still cooks typical Eurasian home cooked staples, you're out of luck.

Enter Quentin's.

Quentin's is a no-brainer place. If you want good Eurasian food that is not cooked in someone's home, Quentin's is the place to go."
Eurasian tastes of heaven,"A little bit out of the way as most taxi drivers have problems finding the Eurasian community centre in Ceylon Rd. We have been there many times and each time have different dishes. Never had a bad one. Personal recommendation - try the prawn moolie.
All dishes come in large size, so go there hungry. Down side is that when it is busy the staff are a bit disorganised."
Good portion for group meal,Servicing tables and layout v classy. group meal for 10 - worth it with 20% off. Portions of Vegetable dishes could be increased. Protein dishes were sufficient.
Good place to explore Eurasian food,"Visited the place during a weekday for lunch, and was quite surprised by the food they offered. My first experience with eurasian food. Must say they tasted quite nice, especially the devil's curry and the prawn curry. The chendol was good too.

Service was prompt and table is suitable for big groups."
One of the restaurants with best play area in Singapore!,"Read about this place mainly due to its lovely play area for kids and have been wanting to try it out for a while. Was so pleased with the yummy food, lovely band, friendly host and overall great ambience, in addition to the great play area of course. What took me so long! Will be back soon!"
pleasant experience,"Great location for big group gathering without cramping or worrying bumping onto neighbouring tables. though i find the outdoor will be abit noisy for chatitng as there is a live band there. Big indoor play area with good variety of toys inside, the kids enjoyed it a lot. There is also an outdoor playground too. almost all their food are delicious with good portion for sharing. Staff are attentive and friendly too."
Food & Service,"I used to love the food there since they moved from their location in East Coast Road to the Eurasian Community House but I feel that the standard of food has gone down a little notch perhaps it’s a change of the cooks or some other reason. The service is ok but it takes quite a while before you are served. The sugee cake however is still great and it’s still ok but from what I hear in the grapevine is that the Restaurant has a number of suppliers and sometimes you can tell the difference in the texture.
The portions of food have been also reduced and sometimes you get the notion that it’s not value for money.
Perhaps going digital has helped them but if the standard of food is not maintained sooner or later it might lose its customers.
On the whole presently I would rate it as a 3+ nearing a 4. Which I think is fair."
One of our all time favorites!,"Amazing food - each of their dishes are spot on - must try Curry Debal, Prawn Bostador and Fretu Bindi. Service is great too and the ambience has this lovely old world feel (like an old club). They have a great kids play area too, which you can see while you are eating. The desserts weren't exceptional, but not bad either.

Go here for a relaxing, long, weekend lunch with family."
Great food as usual at Quentin's,Quentin's doesn't disappoint. Authentic and tasty Eurasian food. Our favourites were the buah keluak curry and prawn bostador.
Hosting a overseas friend & family,We have dined at restaurant on a few ocassions; it is always a joyful experience at every visit. My friend from munich had tried dinner on a sat night. He loved the cuisine & the live band. It is a home coming lunch for him & family
Lunch,Excellent lunch. The food was really good and full of flavour. Would recommend to come and try this great Eurasian place. Booking is required
Delicious and good value,"First time there and the food is good and with the promotion, it is really value for money. The portions are really big and food quality is good esp the spicy ones."
Outstanding Eurasian Peranakan food,"Visited this unique restaurant twice in a fortnight. After being impressed by the 1st visit, a family birthday lunch was arranged. Managed to try a wide variety of items on the extensive menu and yet there are quite a few exciting dish to try in the next few visits. The ayam buah keluak, oxtail soup, Captain's curry were stand outs so far. Do order the nicely warmed up and fluffy baguette bread to go with all the stew and sauces. The sugee cake is one of their signature dessert which is owrthwhile to purchase as a loaf to take home. Another stand out is the gula melaka lava cake. Prices are higher than most peranakan places and though service can be improved, just enjoy the laid back atmosphere of the restaurant and surrounding. Ample parking is found adjacent to the building. Do note the service hours as well."
Hosting a overseas friend,"It was our 3rd visit in 8 mths. Much to our surprise, wE were assigned to the same table. We ordered a medley of dishes. Our german friend was impressed with the dishes. A good introduction to eurasian dishes. We enjoyed the live band & impressive singing by a jolly 86 year old gentleman. Thank you for the memories. Definitely, coming back with friends..."
Charming embience. Forgotten recipes. Warm and friendly service.,Charming. Forgotten recipes. Warm and friendly service. Feels like home cooked food. Generous portions and authentic Eurasia flavours.
"Good food, lovely atmosphere","I love the atmosphere around the restaurant, truly family dining place. Food is good but we were waiting more than half an hour for our order (there were only....5-6 group at that time)"
Quaint and lip-smacking community restaurant,"On a whim, we drove out to Quentin's - one of the last bastions of ""Eurasian"" cuisine. The eatery is located next to the quaint Eurasian community centre and museum, which preserves the history of Singapore's unique intermingling of communities. The food, influence by Portugese, Malaysian and other European/Asian fare, was piquant, plentiful, and more-ish. We also bought one of the jars of exceptional fish pickle at the counter. All in all, a rewarding experience, and well worth the detour for a different take on Singapore."
"Good food, great service in a comfortable setting","We had chicken curry debal, patchri and ended with sugee cake. Dishes were all really nice & had a home-cooked feel to them. I was especially surprised by patchri which was essentially eggplant in a special sauce bursting with flavours. Prices were acceptable for the prompt services & attention we’d received. Would definitely be back again."
"A discovery of new senses, great diversity","Been wanting to try this place for a long while now. Was a really interesting exploration. We ordered what’s in the pictures. Added the banana fritters and chendol. The flavours are new to us. Pigs ears are a favourite of mine. And even the sambal and (can’t recall) the cod sambal. And the veg varieties of the long beans and cabbage were different than anything Peranakan we’ve had before. And to top it off, the digital menu and service was great. Will be back to try more."
Delicious eurasian food,"I was taken to Quentin's by a friend. We had a great dinner on the terrace al fresco. A live band was playing, and a cool breeze blowing. The food was delicious. The ambience was great. It couldn't have been better."
Why we kept on coming back...,"Good food, excellent service and on Friday and Saturday nights, live music of yester-years bring back an air of nostalgia and the good old time... that's why we kept on coming back!"
Average food and above average prices. Nice windy breeze though.,"We ordered an oxtail soup that came cold (not even warm). Tasted more like a slightly sweet milk desert.

Roasted pork had nice crunchy skin, but meat was dry.

Devils curry tasted like a sausage and tomato flavored minestrone soup.

The squid ink squid dish was blend. Insufficient ""umami"" flavor that should come from squid ink. More salty water than anything.

Beef texture was nice although the gravy/sauce tasted like something from a can.

The only redeeming dish was the corn beef fried rice and the fish chips served at the start."
Yummy!,Good yummy homecooked food and kids friendly! Great chill atmosphere. Would def return and try other dishes!
Brilliant dessert,Nice environment. Must try their dessert - durian ice cream cake and their macadamia nuts brownie with ice cream.
Lazy Sunday Brunch,"Googled for kid-friendly restaurants and this came up with stellar reviews, so we thought to give it a go, given that we wanted something different (Eurasian fare isn't common enough I reckon!) and because between our families, we had an almost-3yo, and a 7 and 9yo to entertain.

Quentin's was easy to find, with ample parking and quiet and well-ventilated at 11am on a lazy Sunday morning. The first bowl of keropok and 2 different chillis were complimentary, and excellent for munching on while going through their menu. We asked for suggestions on their popular dishes and ended up ordering a fair bit. Popped the kids into their lovely playroom which was big enough and varied enough to entertain all 3 of them and we watched them from our table since it was a glass walled room with a baby gate. Seating was either in the well-ventilated ""outdoor"" area or indoors. We chose to sit outside, and didn't regret it.

Food came promptly, was delish and quickly polished off. Had the prawn bostador amongst other things. Price was acceptable for the quality. Desserts weren't fabulous, but we weren't there for the dessert anyway, so that's ok.

All in all a lovely place for a lazy Sunday brunch with old friends. I would go there again.

Oh there's also a museum / Eurasian heritage centre in the same building which we wanted to check out, but didn't get a chance to, so we're likely to go back soon!"
surprisingly delicious food in a relaxed setting,"Had dinner with some friends. friendly service, lots of different varieties of Peranakan cuisine, much of which I've tasted for the first time. I recommend the prawn curry as well as the brinjal dish (can't remember the exact name)"
yummy food,everything we ordered was tasty. staff helpful. good service. fun play room for kids. i recommend the cod fishcakes for children.
Great,"Pure blondes on tap. The Wife and I, then girlfriend, liked it so much we decided to get Quentin's to do the catering for our wedding. The guests loved the food.

One small unfortunate point was that on the day itself they set up and left the extra trays of food there with without communicating to the venue or ourselves that someone would have to refill the trays ourselves. Had to find out the hard way. Was pretty embarrassing to have guests help to take out large trays of food to top up the food warmers.

Food was so tasty I'm willing to let all that slide and pretend it didn't happen ha ha."
Quentins .... a place for great food and good atmosphere,We have always enjoyed the great food .... and the music played are all songs that we can sing along to. Highly recommeneded
With family,"Warm welcome, make you feels like home. Enjoyed the band very much. They played oldies. Foods is good and the play area for the children is excellent."
Refreshingly authentic Eurasian,Charming old world setting mixed with excellent service and some outstanding dishes. A band plays on week ends and was belting out some 60s and 70s hearthobs including some Beatles. Off the beaten track worth a visit. All dishes are Eurasian . Reasonably well stocked bar and choice of beers and wine.
Lunch,Great atmosphere and food! Excellent for gathering of families and friends. Neat play area to keep the younger ones entertained while the adults chat..
Food was good although a little pricey. Service was average.,"Had a friends & kids gathering and it was great as there was a private indoor play area suitable for the children 2-6 year olds.
Food was quite good but not very suitable for young children and the kids meal is quite pricey.
Service staff seemed a little overwhelmed as the restaurant was about 80% full for a Sunday lunch.

Would still return on a less busy day."
Family friendly,"The price slightly higher, food taste is great. Environment is ok, there is a kids play room so we can enjoy our meals while kids can have fun in the kids room."
Nice food and environment,The food were great and unique. Environment was cosy and homely. It will be a great place for gathering.
Friends’ Night out!,"Went to Quentin’s based on some good recommendations from peers and was pleasantly surprised at the intrinsic array of presented flavours! I would definitely recommend the oxtail soup, that was the winning dish for me!"
Love the food!!,"It was the first time we visited Quentin. We wanted to find a place where the kids can have some fun while the adults eat and chat.. We must have ordered like 10 different dishes, I must say the food is really good!! However, we waited quite long for the beer and food.
There's a nice band singing through the night. The kids had fun, especially at the ball pit! But the toys are mostly not working or no battery.. Overall a good experience, will definitely visit again!"
Delicious Eurasian cuisine - Yum!,We had been to Quentin's on previous visits to Singapore and on this occasion took or expat daughter and husband who now live in Singapore - both are 'foodies' so they were useful food critics! This is casual restaurant in many senses - it is at the Eurasian Association building so is used by many members of the Assn - with a great children's play area and a relaxed feel. the food standard is however anything but casual and is of a very good standard. if you have not tried Eurasian cuisine before this is one of the few quality locations to try it out. Bar and food service are professional and helpful.
Good play for dining with young children,"Decent food, great play room, nice staff, relaxing atmosphere. Would definitely return again to try more of their food. Thank you!"
"Great food, great deco, if separate family section from other adults would be perfect!","Everything we ordered was great and exceeded expecations. The deco was wonderful creating a good atmosphere as well as the live band. The only thing marring the whole experience for our couple night was being seated with 4 other family with screaming children with 2 birthday parties. We would have preferred to be move to the ""adult areas"" near the live band."
A Good Restaurant for all sort of Visit,Everything we ordered were delicious. This place is really packed during our visit which is on a saturday evening ( so make sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment) . It definitely a lively place with good food and professional service from the team.
A nice evening,"Celebrated my wife's birthday at this restaurant last week. A laid back, no pretence restaurant at the Eurasian Association premises. The restaurant has an indoor and outdoor seating option and reservations are recommended.
The food was awesome, would recommend the Roasted Porku and Prawn Bostador.
They had a very nice quartet playing great live retro music."
Good place for gatherings,Staff were very polite and love the place and ambience. Enjoyed the music as it's much more lively now. Our last visit was 3 years ago when we celebrated my nephew's 21st birthday with my late brother.
"Great Food, Brilliant Band and Superb Ambience","Celebrated my daughter's 15th birthday with a group of 12 on 25th Aug 2018. The food we ordered especially the Ox tail Devil was simply divine !! I give the food 10/10. Service can actually be more attentive, but hey, its informal dining, so no big deal..8/10. The live band was Brilliant..they made the difference !! Good old music from era gone by..10/10. Choice of in-door and outdoor sitting, but you don't feel the Singapore humility and heat...well fan !! 9/10. Ordered the Rainbow cake,it was was delicious but a little too sweet for me but the rest of the party enjoyed..thats what matters..9/10. * note : There is a cakeage charge of 10% for dinning in of the cake ordered and 20% for bringing you own cake..aiyah, bring in so lecheh...order and pay 10% ..its worth it !!!"
great food and great music,"Quentins never disappoints especially with food. Just simply excellent. We tried the Fish bostador, porku tembreneu and fried okra. The portions were huge for a couple and could have easily fed 4 people. Delicious meal accompanied with brilliant live music totally befitting the wonderful Eurasian culture that mixes good food with good music for an amazing dining experience."

Very good food and environment,"The kids love the play room in the restaurant. The food is also fantastic with a lot of spices, adding to the favours."
Excellent place for group dining,"Excellent food, servings are just nice. I will go back for more choices. Great place for parents with kids"
"Relaxed vibe, great music, good food","I really like Quentin's - it's fun and the food is delicious. I went two Saturdays in a row and the band recognised me, so did the uncle. The waiting time for the food is a bit long but the ambience and music more than make up for it."
