Great happened on place,Came I'm out of a very heavy rain shower staff attentive beer great and food excellent well worth visiting. Great views of the river and nice to cill before seeing more sights.
Great spots for bees and snacks,"The restaurant serves rich Lava cake with mango passion fruit sorbet, very refreshing! They made their own craft beers and Kombucha.. Nice atmosphere and the outdoor seating is actually quite breezy. Friendly staffs and reasonable price… It’s a good place to unwind and relax by the riverside.."
Very nice,"During the corona wreck, there were many beers that were a little dull, but they seemed to be completely revived and all the beers were delicious. Food was good too. The wagyu steak was especially delicious. If it's outside, you can bring your dog too."
Had a nice night here,"Having visited here a good few years ago, my wife and I decided to stop for a drink and something to eat. Service was a little slow as they were quite busy but after ordering our food and drinks turned up reasonably quickly. The pizzas we ordered were great and made in a proper pizza oven judging by the taste and texture of them. I also sampled a few of their craft ales which were all great. Happy we stopped as we both had a nice night there."
nice beer restaurant,"Nice beer restaurant but food is very normal, Good for drinking. Will not come back to again for the dinner."
Fantastic place for team dinner,Love everything about this place! The food is nice and value for money! Beer is nice too! And they have the best staff ever! Very attentive and friendly! We had a great team dinner here! Would be here again!
Rather pricey for what’s on offer,A rather pricey bar and restaurant but based on my view as a member of the campaign for real ale in Great Britain and knowing a bit about beer - in the UK craft beer does not carry the premium it does in the global south. It’s all well done with fine views but there are flaws - the pictures of the super salad don’t link with what is presented which is a bowl of kale (see picture) again a commodity green and not really deserving such prices - it’s okay but average due to the pricing.
Family Visit,We had the most amazing dinner experience. One of the guest are gluten and lactose intolerant and on arrival at the restaurant the Manager had written menu with all the options. That was really so unexpected. They have gone out of their way to ensure that the food was what the guest could eat. Waiter was also very informative and their knowledge of the dishes were impeccable. Lovely view to boot!
Have to ask for everything!,"1) After sitting guests, don’t have the service mindset to come back and take order.
2) Served food with providing plates.
3) Quick to leave after serving without asking whether condiments are required
4) Have to ask for drinking water
5) Served cocktail without proving coaster
6) Serving staff often avoid eye contacts with guests
7) Visited bcoz of Oktoberfest promotion but absolutely zero vibe!"
Nice restaurant with friendly staff,"I really like to come to this restaurant for dinner. The food is good and consistent and most importantly, the staff are friendly! They will remember you order and preferences! I love their nachos and buffalo wings! Highly recommended for family, friends gathering and couple date!"
Amazing service and food,"Visited here onthe last day of a weeks holiday. It opens much earlier than other bars / restaurants in the area.
The food was superb, the pork loin dish was one of the best ever. The service, surroundings and atmosphere was first class. Definitely worth trying."
"Yummy food, plenty of beer selections, staff happy and friendly! No SPORT","I popped in here for a quick dinner meal as i was staying close by, i wanted a simple feed and beer. I ended up getting the $58 beef plate, which is rather overpriced, but it was super tasty, well cooked, and it of course filled me up!
The dish and most dishes are rather high in price, so be prepped, this is a tourist area and prices are inflated!

Plenty of beer choices on the menu, the pale ale was my choice, and it was good!

Friendly place, good service, indoor and outdoor seating available.

I was a little annoyed that this place tthroughout google says they show sports and Australian football, but this is NOT the case. No sport is showing here, so don't expect this is a sport venue."
Brewerkz Experience,Satay took too long to cook. The rest are fine. Waiters are attentive. Food are acceptable. Must learn how to serve appetizer before main course.
Alex,"Finally, good sour beer in Singapore Not much choice for the food but everything is great Good choice of the place for dinner or good beer party"
Good to Be Back,"It's been over 2 decades since I last visited Riverside and Brewertz. The good news is that the the service, the food is still as good. I like the ambience and the human traffic in that area is much lighter than across the river which is excellent! Eric was very helpful catering to our dining needs. I will be back again."
Gluten Free Menu,"Asked if anything was GF and got an entire GF menu, A welcome surprise. Appetisers and Mains came at the same time, but not an issue for us."
Great brewery with a great view,"A great little find. Awesome beers and really nice food. Looks out across the water to Marina Bay Sands hotel. A great way to spend a lazy afternoon. Special mention to Mark, thanks for the glass that made it back to Australia! We will be back."
Amazing beer as always,Brewerkz is now my go to place if I have to have beer. Best part is they are pet friendly so I need not worry about leaving her at home. The chicken pizza is really amazing and so is the Aglo Olio pasta.
Great food and ambience,"Party of three and we had good deink, delicious food and attentive service. Group of ex schoolmates catching up as we do once every few months. Food choice and quality was varied enough, drinks were great and service could not be faulted."
Good time!,had a fantastic time over here . All the service staff were impeccable and prompt! Enjoyed the food and drinks too!
Good meal,Good food and service. Location is river front with indoor and outdoor seating. Good value for money and with good service !
Brewerkz (Riverside Point),Very nice place to chill with my friend who i have not seen for more than 2 years. really great place to go
Brewerkz Riverside Point.,Excellent Ambience and view. Food was good and served hot and timely. We went with family and we had to reserve one day earlier. Staff were very friendly and accommodating.
Super dinner,"Food was surprisingly good for a restaurant that prides itself to be a brewery. The appetisers paired superbly well with beers, and very tasty. The KFC and sardines are winners, tempted for 2nd servings. Wagyu beef was very good; marble and done well. Sat outdoors to a very good windy night. Staffs were friendly and patient. Overall, super dinner experience"
1st and many visits to come,"Increase the variety of finger foods (example, chicken wings) would be great. I was there for beer and finger food but the latter restricts me to only 3 choices."
Very expensive beer !!,"In 1997 I visited Brewerkz and at lunchtime they were selling pints of beer for $1 a pint. Today (in 2021) for the same pint of beer Brewerkz is charging $20. Now I'm not the best mathematician in the world but 20 times in 20 years sounds like some pretty steep price rises ! Yes, I felt gouged paying $20 for one pint of beer. Good, but very expensive beer ! There is plenty of other beer in Singapore available for less than $20 a pint !"
Lovely food,The restaurant is in a great spot and sitting outside was a nice experience. The staff could not find my reservation but thankfully there was room. The satay starter was really tasty and the mains of chicken caesar also good. The Wagu beef bowl was exceptional so i would go back again for this alone
Great brewery and food!,"Award winning brewery, tried the Golden Ale and was good and smooth! Food quality is good too, tried the chicken popcorn, wings and pizza! Surprisingly the pizza was good too! Service staff was attentive!"
Great food,"Ordered 3 appetizers for 2 pax, the lamb ribs were outstanding, sg wings platters were good and Cheese stick was ok. It was my 1 visit in about 2 years, it seems the beers list is shorter than it was 2 years ago. Only downside for me, was the reply provided by the gentleman tending to the bar when I asked for the bill, he sounded rather impatient with his tone."
Beer drinking session,The beer was good and the food was good. The environment was nice and pleasant. The service staff was friendly and helpful.
Great place to chill out,Had the soba salad which was so refreshing. Hubby had burger which was also super scrumptious. Service was good too. Sad though they didh't have the raspberry beer but the one suggested by watier was nice - can't remember what it was called but it was citrusy and went well with my noodles.
Good food & great service,It’s was New Year’s Eve dinner. We enjoyed all the dishes and the service was attentive even with a near full house crowd.
Great food and best service ever,"Brewerkz at Riverside Point is our family's go-to place most Sundays. The staff are always ready to help and the place is very airy, clean and welcoming. The minute we approach the entrance, we are always pleasantly greeted by name by a few of the staff who know us well. Our usual order of BBQ Pork Ribs, Meat Lover Pizza, Buffalo Wings and Calamari never disappoint ... and what's a meaty meal without a beer to wash them down? I highly recommend their IPA. At the end of every meal, the staff are also happy to doggy bag any leftovers and wish us a good day ahead. Definitely our all time favorite place for a satisfying and excellent meal experience. :D"
Love the vibes and beer,"My favourite Brewerkz outlet! Lovely warm vibe, good location (near the heart of the action but not too near), and love the pride they take in their beers. Will be back soon!"
Unexpected high level of service and high quality food,"After a visit to the National Museum we unexpectedly ended up at BREWERKZ at Clarke Quay. The service was the best we have experienced in Singapore so far, after having had lunch and dinners in predominantly up-class restaurants. Unexpectedly impressive. Experiencing a bit of flexibility wrt adaptations to a dish, a smile and friendly service, simply remembering who had ordered what dish, was an unexpected true delight, that is becoming increasingly rare, regardless the price level of the restaurant. Thank you Erwin! You made our day!"
Fantastic beer,"There is a wide range of beer available. Fresh, and suiting different taste. My favourite is IPA.

My wife and I patronise this restaurant quite often, mainly for its beers. My wife's favourite beer is Golden Ale, which is light, and fragrant, suitable for ladies.

The food is average but it does have some food that is good, such as the mussels.

Unfortunately, its pork knuckles are a bit dry - I like pork knuckles but I don't usually order it from this restaurant.

The environment is good too, with the review view of the Singapore river, and the view of the old houses along the liver where there are a lot of restaurants and pubs."
Excellent Food and good beers,An excellent place to chill out with friends. Good food and wide range of excellent beers at a reasonable price!
Great food and service for the non-calorie conscious diner,"After the Covid-19 Phase 2 partial reopening, we've been careful when picking where to eat. Brewerkz's tables are well-apart, the ceilings are high and the staff are properly covered up. We have big eater with us (home from uni), so our order would normally feed four: calamari, two half-racks of ribs and a meat lover's pizza. The fried calamari is lightly breaded and the accompanying sauce tasty. The pork ribs have a sweet glaze that is lightly charred to give them a burnt feel. Ribs are sometimes on the fatty side, but always highly flavorful. The meat lover's pizza is packed with pepperoni and ham, and is extremely tasty. The fries (with the ribs) are fresh and good-sized.

The staff are friendly and after a couple of visits, know us by name when we come in."
Best at River Point SG,"Good food, value for the price paid, excellent beer..and the bonus was the kids menu. And not forgetting the portion size.. this will surprise you"
Best IPA,If youAre looking for a best IPA in Singapore here IDE’s the place. Very good view and relaxing place. Good customer service.
Best Burger,"As usual the burgers were brilliant and cooked to perfection. King Brew and Cowboy with excellent, piping hot fresh fries. No issue with customisation. Kids meal is great value."
Great beer with a good atmosphere,"If you are looking for some great beers , a lively atmosphere, good service and the opportunity for a generously proportioned meal, Brewerkz will meet your requirements. You can sit outside overlooking the river."
Good spot for a beer or (one) ?,"Situated at a very nice location on the rivers edge near Clarke Key. Comfortable chairs, but service non-existent so I had to ask for my order. They have a wide selection of beers, but prices are exhorbitant. Two halves cost 24 dollars which I think is a bit steep. Quite a relaxing place to watch the world go by, if you can afford it. (We left without extending our initial outlay) !!!"
Great escape from the scary Coronas no Corvis19,Well we are here two days after the declaration of a Pandemic so most places are quite. But we have our sampler a wonder view over the water and did I mention the sampler. Craft beers here are very nice and it seems so safe to be here. So we are lucky I hope everyone in your world are doing OK. Remember to be safe but enjoy a nice beer not a Corona.
They just launched their Nitro,"They just launched their Nitro Stout and i must say, Guinness, u need to finally step aside Azrol was an amazing host"
Good beers & food.,"Did an impromptu post-run visit. Thirsty, opted for the beer flights, sampled quite a few beers and had the impossible burger. Good experience thru&thru, wouldn't mind a second visit."
"Great selection of beer, good food and even good coffee",Been there awhile times with friends for a afternoon chill their pork trotter is good. Not much of a beer guy so order their ice latte. Din expect a beer place to serve good coffee too!
Gathering,"Wow.... Its amazing what the iconic Brewerkz has done for Singapore... For ages, they retain or better up their quality and services. .. Not forgetting the Crafted Beerz. Bravo!"
Our favourite place to eat in Singapore,"Relocated here in November, first place we ate was Brewerkz and have gone back many times since. Friendly and efficient staff!!!"
"Came for beer, stayed for food","...and it was a good choice. Attracted by the range of beer, we stopped for a drink and it was so good that we wanted another. A look at the menu persuaded us to eat here as well, and we did not regret the choice as the food was pretty good. Outside tables overlooking the quay were nice, and we were impressed enough to return for more beer next evening.
Tip - Pints are much better value than 'stems'."
Great beer,"Two different craft beers ordered, very good. Goulash excellent. Pork tenderloin also good. All the food very fresh and tasty. Very busy location and restaurant. Staff bit slap dash but we enjoyed our time here. Would recommend as a good place for a meal."
What happened? :(,"I have not been to Brewerkz for quite a while and left disappointed with the experience. The place and atmosphere is still great, the food ok but most importantly, the beer was definitely not what it was in the past. It was sadly flat and lifeless."
Lunch at brewerkz,"Had a great lunch and catch up session with my friends at brewerkz. Service and food was great, been visiting brewerkz for years and it never disappoints me."
Great for drinks !,Great place to visit for friends to grab drinks. The revamp place is a great change from the previous decor.
Great,"Great food good service would come again, people were most helpful, air cons were cool and nice atmosphere"
Great range of beers,"Really good location by the waterfront. Very good beer menu. Try the sampler tray! from dark & heavy to lighter fruity & hoppy beers. Not just beers of course, full range of drinks & food. Great helpful & friendly staff"
Great Craft Beers & Atmosphere,"Stopped by for a beer and to watch some sports events on their large screen TVs. They always have several different brews on tap. This is one of my favorite brew houses in Singapore. If you’re into craft brew, Brewerkz is the place to visit!"
Enjoying Singapore beer by the Singapore River,The beer here is clearly fresh and tastes delightful. Especially proud to know it is all locally brewed. The view of the river and the lit canopy over Clarke Quay is also quite nice.
Mr,Amazing beer! Especially the New England IPA! One of the most Juicy IPA’s I’ve ever had! Serious pineapple aroma
Great beer and atmosphere,I had the tasting flight and really enjoyed the west coast ipa! All the staff were really friendly and super attentive- would definitely recommend.
Real ale,Great at last a bar where I don't need to drink larger beer was excellent staff welcoming and friendly wish I had found this first night 14 craft beers to sample great place hope you continue offering the products and food you do now P.S wife says they serve vodka cranberry unlike raffles
Finally a real beer!,"A wide selection of craft beer. I live in Asia, already 8 years, I’m not a brewmaster but I’m a beer lover and let me say that here u find quality. From the basic Pilsner till the elaborated fruity full body high alcohol... slurp... u gonna love it!"
The best beer with the best view !,"This is undoubtedly one of the best places to chill and and have a couple of beers with friends! Brewerkz brews their own local Singaporean beers, and the view of the river against Clarke Quay makes it a great experience in all! If you're here as a tourist or a local, Brewerkz ensures that you have an evening well-spent! Try and get a table outside because it is very windy despite the humid atmosphere of Singapore!

Must try- Crispy French Cheesesticks and the Crispy Calamari! These appetisers works well with a couple of pints of beers.

Beers to try-

Look out for their Dubbel Trubbel in the seasonal flavours!! Apart from that, you must have their India Pale Ale and the Resin Bomb; that is ONLY if you like a bitter beer."
"Good IPA hoppy, refreshing.","Good IPA hoppy, refreshing. Good view of Clark Key and the river. Nachos ok but cheese sank to the bottom of the dish."
Great choice of craft beers,"Spent a very pleasant hour or two here sampling the beers from this microbrewery. Yatish was our waiter who was very informative and helpful. It's overlooking the Clarke Quay, so a very pleasant outlook. Beer was really good and discounted for happy hour before 6pm. Highly recommended."
Good 🍻 beer,Good beer. I like it so much Should come back here again Big screens and good food selection 15 percent happy hour is good until 6pm
"Best Service, Best Burger",Love this place. Staff always go to he extra mile with service standard s come to none. Burgers are really good. Cooked exactly how requested and served piping hot
Great beer,A great place with good handcrafted beer and good location.The Golden Ale was really nice and tasty.
A gr8 selection of beers still,A gr8 selection of beers still (we have been three times over three years). A good selection to choose from with a taster of four beers for you decide what to stay with.
Amazing Atmosphere,We had a great couple of evenings sampling their beers. Lovely view of Clarke’s Quay in the evening - food looks good too. Would recommend the Octoberfest beer.
Great beers in Clarke’s key with view of river,We had a great evening sampling a few of their beers. Very friendly staff. October fest was the best - definitely recommended.
Good intention but too much like a restaurant,"Nice selection of beers.
Feels a little to corporate, more of a restaurant than a bar, it would be nice to just order a beer from the bar instead of having to set up a tab.

It’s really hard for you to find out about the beers, as they insist you sit at a table and do not let you stand at the bar.
A complicated ordering system that seems to confuse the waiters, makes this more frustrating.
Then when we wanted to move tables (to an empty one) it took 3 of them 20 mins to consult and sort it out

Nevertheless the kettle sour series and American pale & IPAs are good beers to enjoy by the river at Clarke’s Quay

Huge venue with seating in and out"
Love the IPA and whole selection,"Love the IPA and whole selection of beers here! All the beers are Cold and Refreshing. Great ambience here, right by Singapore River. <3"
Disappointing visit,"Booked a party of 8, food took ages to come out, and when it did only one at a time over a period of an hour, very disappointing. We have been coming to Brewerkz since it opened in the late 90s and this was the worst visit we have had, we gave them another chance as we didn’t have a good experience a few months ago when only half the beers were available, the service was poor and the general feel of the place had changed. It’s now moved to a smaller site next door, the beers are nowhere near as good, the food was second rate, prices had risen, staff inexperienced although tried hard but we won’t be returning in a hurry."
A rather average place,"Went for lunch with family and friends. Food is reasonably okay but nothing special. Service is rather average. On balance of consideration, poor value for money."
Great atmosphere,"Had a great view of the quay, food and drink selections were aplenty and of good quality as well. The wait staff, Ying was very helpful in providing recommendations during the ordering service as well."
"Great burgers, wings and beer","Great burgers, wings and beer selection. I enjoyed myself and my group did also. Our regular Football hangout."
Good ambience and space,The place is great and there’s plenty of space for guest to enjoy the scenic view. BeerS are great and services are good. We enjoyed it here
Amazing food,"Loved the baby back ribs, red bass and golden ale. Delicious food with an amazing riverside view. Perfect!"
great service,Great service and really enjoyed our experience. They made us feel like royalty and we will be sure to return on our next visit to Singapore.
Really impressive!,Visited Brewerkz 2 days ago. Really a great place to hang out with friends drinking fresh beer and delicious food
Very disappointing experience,"After a long walk through the city I went to Brewerkz to have a beer and enjoy the view. I was completely neglected by the personnel. No one even took the initiative to give me the menu or ask me if I would like to order something. After 20 minutes I left disappointed.
I will never go to Brewerkz again and recommend everyone to skip this company!"
Great experience!,"The food is nice, the location is convenient, the ambience of the restaurant is just nice and the service is excellent. Thumbs up to service crew as there are quite a number of big group of customers but their attention to their customer is always there no matter how busy they are. Will definitely go back for the food and service."
Good,"Food was good and the staff were very friendly. However, there were flies for seats nearer to the kitchen and toilet."
Special Service prior to U2,"This is about Service, for me (1), I was there hoping to have a couple of beers at the bar before the U2 concert, (bar seating was not open). Not happy and Restaurant was in FULL mode busy...was able to chat with Shane, one of the managers. She was able to get me a beer and eventually get me a table. Due to timing, I elected to have chips with salsa with guacamole. Of course, had another beer. Shane was there throughout. Thanks Shane !!! Oh, am American and live in Chiang Mai , Thailand."
Refreshing,"New Experience to the very 1st Brewerkz outlet@Clarke Quay after they decided to relax “One Corner”. The outlet technically moved next door after operating in the heart of Riverside Point for 20+years.

The familiar servers are changed out. Fresh new look just like the new outlet. Open concept sports bar compared to the previous restaurant setting.

Food is still as . Loving it
Iconic Brewerkz being part of my Life!
Highly recommend the place for old timers buddies chill out"
One of the best burgers EVER,"While I could have easily rated Brewerkz a 3 for lower than expected service, the amazing burger that I had brings it to 4.

This was my first visit to Brewerkz and I had high expectations for the beer, food and service. 2 of the 3 met my expectations but service was lacking. The staff were very kind when we interacted with them, but the attention that was paid to my table was not to the standard I would expect...slow and inattentive.

I definitely recommend Brewerkz for their food and beer and will give them another try during my next visit to Singapore to see if the service has improved."
Great service and food; Birthday boy was impressed!,"Came to celebrate a friend's birthday. As I was waiting for my friends, I experienced a headache and the crews were incredibly attentive and asked if I needed medication and gave me hot water. Food came in time and was delicious as always! Birthday boy was also surprised with the dessert (didn't know it is complimentary) and everyone had a good time! It's very rare to find good service these days, and Brewerkz's service sets a new bar here (and will be hard to compete). We will be back for sure :)"
Great selection of beer!,Great selection of beers and love the taster set option!! Nice atmosphere with inside & outside options. Will definitely be a regular!
Awful from start to finish,"What can I say about this restaurant? The service is appalling despite there being almost more staff than guests. My food arrived stone cold and had to be left sitting on the table for another 10 minutes to go even colder because one of my group’s meals didn’t arrive at all. The price was shocking considering we only had one course and the only time the waiters were attentive was when the bill finally arrived (we had to ask for it several times). The waiter and waitress stood over us while we were sorting out our cash to pay the bill. I’ve travelled the world and have only ever experienced that type of pressure-to-pay in shoddy restaurants. Overall the entire experience was stressful, expensive, poor and a terrible reflection on the great customer service that is evident elsewhere Singapore. Avoid avoid avoid! :-/ Would rate at zero stars if that were an option."
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,"Where do I start! Overpriced and appalling service find it up! We were served by no fewer than 5 different waiting staff but that didn’t improve the experience. Mates main meal came out and luckily was cold (luckily one the loosest possible terms) Had to chase my main twice and in between times we were brought sharing plates for my mates dinner! Was shocked when the bill came as was the most expensive meal we’ve had in the last 2 weeks, with the worst possible service! Never again and I’d recommend you steer well clear-this place would get no stars if that were possible!"
Fine Thanksgiving Buffet,"OK, it was not Mom's hosting of Thanksgiving, but it was what was on offer. There was plenty of food, but of course plenty of people. Uncle Vinnie wasn't there, but some loud Americans were, to make me feel at home. The staff did its best to keep the buffet stocked and beers flowing at the tables. If in Singapore for Thanksgiving again, I would certainly consider going back."
The most waitstaff with an absence of service,Guess it is another wannabe hipster place. Beers aren’t bad. Service is non-existent. KFC (Korean Fried Cauliflower) sounds better than it is. WagYu burger was Ok. Guess overall wouldn’t really recommend. Much better options.
Great Sunday,"Great sunday spot, 2 x tasters and a plate of charcuterie. Excellent beers, cool temperature under the fans and delicious food. Highly recommend"
Nice Place to Chilled!,One of the best restaurant that sells good beer and food. We ordered the pork tenderloin and it really goes well with the beer! We will definitely be coming back again soon!
Overpriced. Avoid. Better,Overpriced. Avoid. Better value elsewhere. Catering to tourists who don’t know better. That’s all I’m going to day
Great food,great food and beer. we had the kurobuta pork tenderloin which was very soft and juicy. wide selection of beer . went with my 2 toddlers and it's a great place for family to chill and have meal.
Still the best craft beer in Singapore,"Brewerkz started the craft beer pub trend in Singapore over twenty years ago, and their IPA is still the best."
The Best Restaurant in whole Singapore!,Were on our honeymoon and Brewerkz has one of the best hamburgers I have ever eaten in my life! ( Guakamole has become on of my favourites)! We also got shampaine so it got even better! Thank you for the warm hospitality and the food.... delicious!
"Excellent food, friendly service and nice ambiance","We've been visiting this outlet and the one at the Stadium for more than 10 years, either for family lunches or attending friends/company events. Service is good, fast and friendly. The food is also excellent (although the price of the lunch menu keeps increasing over the year). We will always come back for a pint or 2 of IPA (and maybe more) and the fish & chips :)"
