Lunch at coucou,Nice and lovely food. Good service. Will come again. Visited the different outlet at suntec. Taste feel same
Good food!,Nice MALA soup. Seldom find drinkable MALA soup. The ingredients are fresh too. Value for money! There are also a great variety of beverages to choose from! Overall good quality!
Good hotpot dinner,Date night with my wife. Never disappoints. Price a bot expensive though especially with the Lunar New Year Surcharge.
Awesome Presentation!,"Cozy ambience, great food highly recommended! Amazing range of bubble tea as well! Coconut chicken soup base is a must!"
Chill place nice food and service,Nice food and service!!!! Many food choices and environment is good. Recommend this place to all!!!!
Always good quality and taste,"I‚Äôve came here three times with family. The food materials are fresh and tasty. The soup bases are made with good quality materials like ox bones, chicken meat etc. fairly good value considering how much meat are in the soup base itself."
Food quality,Nice hotpot with nice ambience but service abit messy when it come to peak hour. So advice to go during not peak period
2nd time visit,It's our 2nd time visit. Service is still as good.. We tried some new dishes and I think the beef tongue is quite nice. Things are not cheap here but the quality is good! Can buy ecard from fave to get some discounts!
Invincible hotpot,Yummy food and nice place to dine in super nice service free ice cream and very good soup will come again :D
"Amazing experience, soup and freshness in food",Went to i12 outlet. Staff friendly and service was excellent! Food fresh and quality of soup is the best.
Cou Cou,The design of the restaurant is very unique. The food here was pretty amazing. There was many flavours and varieties of soup selection. The waitress was also very polite and respectful.
Great place,Great place to eat n chat! Lots of good food and much privacy. Nice ambiance. Great service. Place to go !
Good food,Excellent service... Food is fresh and the soup base are full of ingredients... nice ambience and friendly staff
Family dinner,Seems to be a popular hotpot spot. Serving speed is quite fast too. We chose a Taiwanese mala and a mushroom soup base to try.
Steamboat,"Visit on a Saturday late afternoon 330pm .
The price of the steamboat pot is $48 with two flavour .
Order the pig stomach pot with ingredient in it . But the pig stomach ingredient is longer tender after cooking for long . The other flavour is Taiwan Ma La , the spices is not flavourful enough and less spicy .

I was told they are popular for live seafood but did not communicate to us that the combination of meat ( chose beef ) and seafood are not live seafood $108 .
The portion is big.
However I think most of the seafood is frozen seafood .
And the combination of vegetable $18 is worth of vale .

The condiment sources $4.80 for each person , Similar like Hai De Lao .

In between the meal , provide a glass of sorbet .

Lastly desert only serve low quality ice cream .
Hao Di Lao desert is much better.

Services level not so good as Hao De Lao , can be more attentive .

Decor is better than Hao Di Lao .

Personally I will visit Hao Di Lao because taste and price is much better than this outlet."
Yums,Good quality ingredients in comfortable setting. Nice touch with the lu rou fan (mince pork over rice)
Yummy food,Nice rice and fruits soup not so nice. Meat ok and not bad Wont get the soup but no choice so no choice
first visit,their lu rou fan in their appetiser buffet was very addictive! quite limited soup options if you cannot consume beef
Great atmosphere and service,"CouCou has a great selection of appetisers and meats. The price is competitive with other steamboat restaurants. The best is the bubble tea they offer here which complements the steamboat well!

One thing they can improve on is perhaps using fresher lettuce as the base for serving the pork."
Best Steamboat in Town!,"Tasty Steamboat with Mala Hot Soup, surprisingly delicious with good customer service from the team!"
The Excellent Hotpot! !,Ambience and table setting were very inviting. Variety of food is wide with good selection of soups and meat. Excellent
YUMZ THE BEST HOTPOT,"Awesome service, good food. The soup is great, the meat is fresh, the atmosphere is very classy!!!!!"
10/10!,"From the very cosy ambience, to the delicious variety of food, our first experience at Coucou was 10/10"
Nice place to hang with friends,It is a very comfortable environment to hang out with friends. The service is great and the food arrives fast.
Give a yes to life and bbt,The food is good because there is free bbt and the ambience is good and the prawns they help to peel too great service
Great time at Cou Cou,"Food was v good, service was excellent! First time here but certainly won‚Äôt be the last time! Recommend to try!"
Great place for hotpot!!,Service and food is great. One of the better hotspots I have eaten in Singapore. Would love to see membership status soon!
HDL should step up its game,Food was excellent in general; meats and greens were presented in a beautiful arrangement that was visually appealing to the eye! Would definitely come back here again.
Pleasant experience,"I‚Äôm quite a regular go-er of hotpot restaurants, and would say that even though the variety of ingredients is much lesser here than other places, they are mostly of very good quality and at decent prices. The meat dishes even have their own pool of vegetables which the waitress will kindly remind you. Just felt the soup pot price is a tad too high (though yes it‚Äôs chock full of ingredients like pork trotters). Love their side dishes and desserts and Ru Rou fan which is a nice touch. also overall vibes are very elegant and spacious. Nice music played too."
Nice family restaurant,"We enjoyed the food here, especially the hotpot and minced pork rice. Friendly staff and good place for family"
Best hotpot place,This is the best place for us to dinner. The food very fresh and nice. And staff very friendly will come back again. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª

Lunch,Went to the Katong branch with my girlfriend during Christmas eve during lunch hours. Prices are higher than the typical hotpot restaurants but the environment was good and the food was tasty. Bonus point for the tofu to be unlimited if you order the Taiwanese pot.
Great hotpot experience in good environment and service was excellent.,Great food and service! Pork tripe soup base was tasty and refill was generous. Ingredients were very very fresh and generous.
Cou Cou is a nice place for meeting up,My first time here. Very nice ambience and excellent service. The staff recommendation is good! Look at the spread! Oh there is promotion too....1 for 1 oyster and draught beer!

Favorite hotpot in the East,"Amongst the hot pot chains, Coucou is one of the better ones with Premium ingredients, quality soup base matched with impeccable service. Simple touches like Chinese tea, limitless toufu toppings, shaved ice palate cleansers and ice cream desserts completes the hot pot experience. A must try if you are in the katong area."

Gooooooood,Good quality food and really nice atmosphere. The food presentation is great and the mala soup is delicious
Delicious & Beautiful,"Dishes are presented very beautifully, and fresh. The bovine flavored tomato broth is a good recommendation for soup choice. Side dishes include braised pork rice and other standard appetizers and condiments. Expect a long wait even with reservation as the place seems pretty popular. Good food though!"
Definitely will come again.,Staff is friendly. Service was excellent. Portion and serving variety catered for different group sizes.
Food review,Had dinner at Katong i12Service is good. Wide variety of appetizers and Soup base is more to sweet than savory‚Ä¶
"Great ambience, food ok svc",Food was good and delicious! Service is a bit slow as staff were slow to onboard and waiting for previous group to leave Would prefer for digital menus to streamline the ordering process
COU COU KATONG i12,Staff was friendly and service was excellent. Food was fantastic and timely. Will definitely come again.
Dinner,"Food was superb and nice, served almost immediately after ordering. Staffs were also attentive to us."
Food review,Best sour vege soup at a hot pot restaurant. The braised minced pork and rice goes well together. Would definitely come back again.
Nice soup hotpot,Loved the soup very much. We ordered the Taiwanese mala soup which comes with braised tofu and pork and also the spicy sour fish soup which is my fav.
Poor,"Worsed than any of the Bugis hotpot. Slow service, get the wrong orders, no free smoothie because it is half hour to last order, gave the wrong bubble tea and even charged us for the bubble tea which I have to highlight to them. Even I informed the manager about the bad experience, she just smile to me. Will not return again or visit another outlet. Not worth it. Haidilao or beauty in a pot is even better with the same amount of money spent."
Will come back,"first time visit here and we love their meatballs, generous portion of beef too! And the pork broth is really good!"
GOOD FOOD,"GOOD FOOD !! The food, especially the soup and the beef was very delectable. Would definitely recommend if you want hotpot in the east."
Nice hotpot,Came with friends to enjoy this wonderful hotpot. Nice service and good food. Recommend to you and will come again
Rainy TGIF at Cou Cou,"The menu is very extensive, rather tedious for first timer. Wish there could be some recommendations for first timer for decision making."
Ms,"Very nice ambience and friendly service. Soup base was delicious complete with many condiments. The drinks are really amazing and how they would let us choose the sugar persentages! The lu rou fan was also really nice, the seats see comfy and the food are amazing!!!"
"Great visit , soup is amazing",Visited this place with my sister and wanna say the portion is exceptionally massive and generous!! Love this place and staffs are friendly and attentive too
