Birthday celebration,"Wheelchair friendly, mum’s birthday. Mondays margarita offers, friendly staff, restaurant very accommodating, nice place to go for drinks and dine and celebrations"
"Birthday chill out, Margarita Monday",We really enjoyed our chilling out as it’s a Monday and it’s margarita Monday and mum’s birthday.Service was good and service staff were friendly
Taco Tuesdays and Happy Hour!,"As I’m still quite new to the local Singaporean food scene, @papistacossg was recommended by a friend’s friend and I found out online that they just opened a new branch in Tanjong Pagar this May

We came coincidentally for Taco Tuesday (3 tacos for the price of 2) and even managed to catch the last few minutes of happy hour (before 7pm) YAY cuz drinking in SG is damn expensive y’all

A word of advice - it’s probably best to make a reservation online as we had to sit outside (luckily it wasn’t too hot)

[Al Pastor Taco]
We loved the vibrant taste of the juicy pineapple chunks, which added some zing to the intense flavours of the Mexican sauces and marinated pork. Also bonus points for how this wasn’t spicy at all!

[Beef Quesadilla]
Compared to the tacos, I preferred this more as it had a milder seasoning of verde salsa, plus the grilled beef was ultra tender!"
Great taco spot in Singapore,Stopped in here for lunch with the family. Had several different tacos between the different family members and everyone loved what they chose. Staff was super friendly and helpful too!
Delectable Mexican cuisine in a tight space,"I had heard really good things about this Mexican joint, so first chance I had, I was there for lunch. It took a while to get seated as the staff dealt with those with reservations first. Space is a bit of a premium there - around four tables al fresco, a few seats either side of the 'window', and counter seating inside. Being alone, I was seated at the counter where I got a chance to watch how the items on the menu got prepared. I chose a pair of fish tacos (fresh sauces, fish was soft inside with a snappy crunch on biting, very tasty) and a refreshing glass of frozen margarita for lunch. I also liked the decor which featured movie posters as well as a sort of Day of the Dead display. Tip: best to visit in a small group so as to try more items on the menu"
Friendly and celebrating Mexican food,"Went to the branch at Tanjung Pagar, very relaxing atmosphere with an open kitchen and bar concept. Simple decor outdoors as well as indoors. A popular place and brunch menu on Sunday. Had their Tacos, Quesadillas, salads as well as burritos! Tasted authentic Mexican home cooked meals. Their frozen margaritas are good too. Ended celebrating a birthday cake for my wife while the whole restaurant singing her the birthday song! Service was friendly and in celebrity mood. Price was mid range."
Underwhelmed,"It wasn’t that great. Service was good but not the food! I use to love it, it seems to have lost its touch, the fish tacos weren’t fresh and yum tonight they were very meh along with the shrimp ceviche and gauc salsa and chips. Unfortunately Won’t be returning in a hurry"
Sombrero night,"Papi’s Tacos, Tanjong Pagar: Mexican original hole in wall at Seah street so well received it has now opened a second spot at Tanjong Pagar. Dim light, bright neon lights, sombreros and crowd-pleaser food tick all the right boxes! #eatstylishtravelstylish"
Amazing Food and Service,Visited Papi Tacos with my friends and it was an amazing trip down to this small and friendly Mexican Restaurant!! Love the shrimp and fish tacos very much :) Will come again.
The Best Magaritas in Singapore,Authentic Mexican food!! The Carnita tacos were delicious!! Definitely recommend any of their options with carnitas! The Margaritas though...!! So so so so so good!! Honestly the best I have had!
Good showcase of Mexican food,"My sister likes Mexican food, and Papi's Tacos did a great job. We were there for the first time, and seated at the counter. Mr Espinoza (Papi) is a friendly and perceptive chef-boss who makes Mexican food and Mexican people look fun and good. A total food ambassador for his country. He strives to put a smile on his customers' faces, gives nice surprises and is open to feedback on his food from people. Keep up the good work!"
Margarita…,"Food was very good and prices reasonable, margarita was very good and the service was excellent, the staff very friendly and accommodating, will visit again soon"
Dry and flavourless tacos,"We had the nachos and two types of tacos. The guacamole had no flavour. Both meats in the tacos were extremely dry, the tacos had not been seasoned and were crying out for some salt. Liquid poured from them when we picked them up and they were buried in raw onions. We were in Mexico fairly recently and these are sadly nothing like the real deal. There was no spice, no tang, no balance of flavour. Just dry and flavourless. We ate and left. Really disappointing."
Solid tacos,"Not a big fan of Mexican food, until my friend dragged me to this hole-in-wall joint. A very cosy open kitchen accompanied with warm hospitality. I must say the fish tacos is the winner amongst all! I am a convert now!"
Probably the best Mexican restaurant in Sg,"No music, but great vibes! Chef Maurice is friendly and shared with us her experiences in Mexico and New York. Sat at the counter, looking at the tacos being freshly made really made our day. Flavourful, fun and unforgettable experience!"
Back Again for more!,Returned visit after a year of dining restrictions and the team was still accommodating and friendly. Had the special ribeye steak which was not on the menu and it tasted amazing! Tacos were still on point and we are glad that we came back!
Great little place,"Booked based on a friend's recommendation. For a Monday night, the small but lively venue was busy with a great atmosphere, attentive staff and lovely food. Will definitely return."
Margaritas,"Food was great and prices reasonable, margaritas was so good, service staff very friendly and polite, one of the better Mexican restaurant around , keep it up"
Good Tacos and Strong Margaritas!,"Visited Papi's Tacos for the first time for a casual lunch. It is a cosy taqueria so it can get filled up pretty quickly!

Ordered some tacos, chips with guac and some drinks. Loved the fish and chorizo tacos, and thought the beef was not bad,

Service was prompt and attentive but I had the impression they were trying to rush us to leave."
Great Tacos and other Mexican food!,"My whole family loves this place. Good Mexican food - and wonderful drinks for all ages. Best Mexican food in Singapore. And, actually quite comfortable sitting outside under the awning with the fans on - even on a very hot day."
Best authentic Mexican food in Singapore,"First visit tonight and will not be the last. Was recommended to and hosted by a good friend, Will who has Mexican roots. We sat up on the counter, started with Chips and homemade Guacamole, chatted to the chefs and owner and enjoyed the best homemade-style mexican food I've eaten in Singapore. Best, by far. I especially recommend the Tacos de suadero (slow cooked beef brisket), Tacos de camaron (grilled shrimp) and any of the quesadillas coupled with a Frozen Spicy Margarita with Tajin and traditional Tres Leches (3 milk cake). Absolutely fabulous - taste and presentation."
Small little Mexican tavern facing Raffles Hotel’s carpark entrance,Read that this is an authentic no frills Mexican Taquiera. I ordered the fish tacos to go. Tasty. Tacos come in small bites. The place had a crowd at 515Pm on a Sunday! Wow.
A great experience,Great food and great service. Small place that punches well above its weight. The food was great and the service was warm and friendly. No concerns about recommending this place to anyone.
Great food and friendly staffs,"It's a great place for friends to meet and enjoy good food with good vibes. Always feel welcomed at this place, tacos are fantastic and staffs are friendly and attentive. Befriend with them and you might get free tequila shots!

It's a small restaurant so do make sure you book before heading over to avoid disappointment! Overall, I'd recommend this place to everyone."
Quesadillas are good,"Good enough carnitas tacos and pollo quesadillas in Singapore! Get lime margaritas by the bottle, it's cheaper!"
BEST PLACE EVER,If youre looking for a place to sit down and chill... this is the place. Food is excellent. All the sauces you need. Freshness and everything. Ambiance is superb. And most especially the staff here is the coolest people you’ll ever meet. They will take care of you and keep you best company. Papis numero uno!!!
Food and Ambience,"If you're looking for authentic Mexican Food in Singapore then look no further. Papi's Tacos is by far once of the best restaurants with all u need in one stop. Staff are friendly, music is good and the Ambience is just perfect to feel like you are in Mexico eating those Pulled Beef Crunchy Tacos and not to mention the Juicyness of their Tacos. Special mention to their very own hot sauces out of which the Habanero is the best I've had ever. Will definitely make it a point to visit them at least once a week"
PAPI'S SERVES THE BEST TACOS. EVER.,"4 of us ordered a taco platter and after our first taco, it was so delicious we HAD to go for round 2. We would have went for round 3 if our stomachs allowed a 5th and 6th taco. Prawn taco would be my fav! Defo would go back again."
Great Mexican food at reasonable price,I got a takeaway from Papi’s Tacos yesterday evening - we went for the taco set for 4 people with a choice of 3 meats and 3 sides. I felt compelled to write a review as the food was absolutely fantastic. All of the meats were great... pulled pork... chicken... pulled beef. The pulled beef was a definite 10/10. The sides were all freshly prepared and the habanero sauce was so tasty. Portions were generous with loads of tacos. Great value for money all in all and the best Mexican food I’ve had in Singapore after 4 years here. Recommended.
Classic margarita to die for!,Absolutely love everything bout this place. We had the fish taco and beef quesadilla and really loving the classic lime margarita. Hits every spot. Love it!
Best Mexican in town,"The food I’ve tried here brings me back to those amazing times when my grandma used to cook loca Mexican food when I was a kid.

The taste of the tacos is almost the same to those you could expect to pick up outside the metro “Balderas” station but clean and safe.

If I was to close my eyes while drinking one of their delicious margaritas I could honestly feel the sea breeze from Cabo before I get naughty holiday ideas whilst finishing my second round.

If you’re after some out of the box Mexican food then this is not your place but if you want to take your tongue into a flavours adventure... this is the place to be!

The staff that runs this place is incredible. Popping up alone after a hard day on the grind is easily forgotten when they greet you by your name and put a cold as frothy in front of you.

What else can I say... the chef is Mexican and the manager a weir Mexican-Chinese mix so... there’s your answer!"
I ❤️ Papi’s Tacos,"Papi’s Tacos is my favorite! The best and only authentic Mexican restaurant in Singapore. Being from Texas, I have a very high standard for Mexican food and it is true “Papi’s knows Best”! Delicious authentic food by talented Chef Mauricio served up by Ivan and the super friendly staff. I am there every week. My home away from home! Deliciosa comida, salsas y bebidas!"
Great Service & Great Food,This was during the COVID-19 period and the team was very accommodating of our last minute dinner request for a table of 5. Drinks tasted really good and were nicely balanced. Food was straight-to-the-point and priced well. Perfect for sharing and very good vibes overall
Had A Great Time with friends and kids,"Went on Sunday at about 530 because kids were hungry early. little girl want a full cheese quesadilla which they accommodated and was delicious!!

Boy thoroughly enjoyed his beef quesadilla which I shared with him.

We had the fish tacos which never disappoint and the spicy chorizo.

Great meal on a Sunday ! Food coma ensued"
Lots of room for improvement... very bad experience,"Really get it wrong on a lot of solvable things.
1) No mix and match on the tacos? Variety is the whole point of taco stands/shops. Staff acknowledged that people did not like this but made no effort to accommodate or apologize. The restaurant was empty — staff had plenty of time to carry this out.
2) Artificially difficult to get a reservation. Forced an 11am reservation — when we left at 12:30 there was no one else eating there... ??
3) Margarita is basically water. No flavor whatsoever. Should not be called a margarita but rather water with lime.
4) Lime slice was too big. Now I know I’m getting into the details, but the point of a lime wedge in a Corona is to push it in. They slice too big. How does a taco shop get that wrong??
5) TACOS ARE NOT GOOD. Swapped with a friend for the pork — and had beef. Super runny with water pouring out.

I am disappointed that anyone thinks this place is good."
Awesome time,"Loved the hospitality, had such a great time it made me forget my worries, also my name. Will be back for more!"
High Expectations,"The people who left great reviews obviously don't know what a taco should taste like, or never left the country to experience true Mexican tacos. What they ate are imitation tacos put together by some dude in a kitchen and calling them tacos.

My Experience: Ambience was great. Frozen margaritas were the bomb! Then the tacos came. Tasteless!. I tried pretty much each taco and every single one of them looked beautiful but tasted like a55. Manager asked me what was wrong and I told him to take a bite, he said it tasted salty (that's because I had to add salt to get some taste). Bottom line, when you see this place keep walking and eat across the street at the lobster/burger place. Your tacos ruined my weekend!"
Best Mexican Food in Singapore,"The fish tacos are the best I've had anywhere. In the world. Period.
The brisket tacos are excellent too.
The quesadillas are oozing with cheese and the burritos are bursting at the seams.
I find myself eating even after I'm full.

The folks manning the grill are super chill and hard working. The whole place has a good vibe and the manager is accomodating and genuinely friendly. They even play great music."
"Great food, great service","Food was affordable and delicious, service was great! Fish tacos and beef quesadillas are must orders! Definitely deserve repeat visits!"
Most value for money Mexican food!,"This is my second back to Papi’s and their food never disappoints! All the food that I ordered, shrimp ceviche, beef and chorizo quesadillas, fish and prawn tacos were all fantastic! The service was also great, my friends and I were seated quickly and the menu was clearly and patiently explained by the staff. The drinks were also good, nicely mixed, balanced and went along well with the food. Ivan and Jeff were very helpful and gave us a very pleasant dining experience. Will definitely be back!"
Autentique,"Papi’s is always busy ,but if you have a chance to get a table in a busy day the food is really Is worth it Is really autentique Mexican food"
"Been a few times, will go back again","Food - excellent
service- excellent
ambience- excellent
The chef and the manager know how to run the place, always making an effort to talk to customers and ensure that they have a good time.

Would recommend to any one, in pairs, groups, for a drink and a snack as well as a full on meal. We were so stuffed we walked out of there sideways!"
Love this place!!,"The food is always amazing- always gotta start the meal with the holy trinity (chips, pico, and guacamole!) and highly recommend the slow braised pork burrito:) the beers are always cold, margaritas are delicious and there’s a great selection of tequila! The atmosphere is great and staff is always friendly and attentive. If you’re in SG, check it out!"
Hidden gem in Seah St!,Hidden gem in Seah St! Probably one of the most authentic Mexican Restaurant I’ve visited. No-frills tacos and awesome ambience made our evening special with my partner!
Avoid at all costs,"Service: Horrible service at this place. Had a reservation at 9 and was told by a member of the staff that my table was getting ready. The manager then proceeded to give the seat to another customer. Managers name was Ivan. He told me that because they were his “friends” and they had made a booking through him, they were entitled to the seats first. Never have I faced such abhorrent service in my life before.

Quality of food: Food was sub par at best. Quality was definitely compromised as it was nearing the end of the night.

Cleanliness: the table that we were served on had traces of the previous patrons food remnants. In light of the covid-19 pandemic, this is highly unacceptable. Further, they had simply used a wet cloth to clean the table when requested as opposed to using any form of sanitisation products.

The entire experience was highly unpleasant. The unpleasantness was further exacerbated by Ivan’s wanton disregard for the customer’s well being and told me to “make a complaint if you want, but I am the manager here.”"
Best Mexican ever!,"Papi’s is the place to be for a quick lunch and a margarita to make it lush; or a night out with the better half, or friends, or a girly night even! Papi and his team will make sure your tummies are full, your heart happy and blood rushing after a margarita or ten!

The guacamole, tortillas, heck even their sauces are handmade and blended! The attention to detail and extremely good food makes Papi’s a regular haunt! Can’t go 2 weeks without my fix! The fish tacos are to die for and do try the strawberry margarita.. puts out the slight tang from the spiced sauce on the fish!

Also, they serve the smoothest tequila I’ve ever tried!"
Quite amazing tacos!! The,Quite amazing tacos!! The tacos are cheap but jam packed with flavor and I strongly recommend you get the 1st set that also comes with their grilled corn with your choice of tacos. The salsas offer heat for all heat levels.
Excellent Fresh-Mex!!,"The fish! The shrimp! The pico! The guac! Everything was fresh and the flavors were spot on. This was a wonderful experience - great food, great service, and great vibe.

My table met Papi (Maurice) and really enjoyed his vision and passion for his restaurant.

We will definitely be back!

Note: this is not Tex-Mex, so it’s not a rice & beans or queso kind of place."
AMAZING,"Super fresh, super tasty, super friendly. Don't hesitate, eat here!! Arrive early as it is very busy and pop your name down on the list, it's well worth the wait!"
Fantastic tacos!,"Awesome place for dinner. Outstanding tacos al pastor, steak, fish....yummy mezcal margaritas. The place for tacos in Singapore."
"awesome vibes, authentic food, fantastic drinks","as a solo diner, i really enjoyed my meal at Papi's served by the friendly and helpful staff on the floor and behind the counter. the food was exceptional- fresh, homemade, simple (simplicity is a virtue) but unexpectedly flavorful. i am a fan of mexican food and can conclude that out of all the ""mexican"" joints ive been to in singapore, Papi's has the most authentic tacos one can find.

p.s. dont forget to indulge in some of the mezcal cocktails too, they are a real treat."
Definitely the place to try. And you’ll become a regular.,"1. Location/ space: near raffles hotel / seah street. So easy to find and I was staying right at a loft right above papis so was even easier to drop by !! The space has open area with tables and a lot of times it is reserved so if you are going with a group of people - you better check and see if you can reserve the spot.

2. Food: I love Mexican food. I love tacos - and this was the best I had in Singapore. i tried their chorizo first time and after that the platter for 5 tacos. My favorite is fish, chorizo but all the rests are good. It’s served fresh and nice - and the size is good too. ;)
Like the margarita, frozen margarita too.

I am going to try other menus later too as there is variety and also some menus available for vegetarians.

I brought another mexican friend the other time who is quite a foodie person - He did show me thumbs up.

3. People, service - they have many regulars. The staff remember names of the customers - and are friendly. They keep to their principle for serving fresh food. The can see that the team members enjoy working there.

Recommend for anybody who likes Mexican food or just want to have good fun meal!"
"Great Margs, awesome tacos, and fun atmosphere","This was not our first visit, but after several, it's now apparent this has become our favorite Mexican food in Singapore and warrants a review! We are typically not fans of frozen margs, but Papi's are shockingly delicious, and not watered down....and kudos to no plastic straws. Then there is the street corn (closest to authentic style we get in the states than any other SG Mexican restaurant) and the shrimp tacos are simply the best. To top it off, we love the atmosphere here. Attentive service and a knowledge of the offerings are two things that are a sign of passion and authenticity. Thanks Papi's!"
Are we not worthy as your customers?,"We were excited to come here and try the tacos because it was highly raved. We are foodies, and we wanted to try everything. When we were ordering, the waiter actually judged us and said that “it’s impossible to finish everything you just ordered”, and as we are using eatigo rewards, we “are not allowed to pack our leftovers”. We were taken aback by his remarks because he didn’t come from a place of concern when he judged what we ordered, but rather it seemed like he was treating us this way just because we are using the eatigo rewards. We are full working adults and we are willing to pay any amount for food that are worthy. For us, trying out new restaurants is not just about having a meal. But it is also about the experience - from our interactions with the staff to the actual eating. If there are options to be able to enjoy this experience at a discounted price, why shouldn’t we indulge in it?

Throughout our meal, the staff were constantly hovering around and clearing whatever empty dishes, as if to signal to us that we have to be done soon and leave afterwards. It was uncomfortable, unnerving and truly an unpleasant experience.

Don’t get us wrong; the food here is great but the service provides could do a lot more work.

Cheers!"
"Good food, great service!","Though small, this joint serves delicious Mexican food. We tried the fish tacos, as per recommendation by the owner. They came with extra sauce (for no charge) and were great, with a nice char to the fish and good taco dough. On top of that, we had the chips and guacamole which did not disappoint either. The staff were friendly and approachable, with good recommendations of what to order. Overall, it was a very positive experience and I would go there again! :)"
Amazing tacos fast service,"Service was very efficient, food came almost instantaneously on a Friday evening The beef tacos were the bomb!! However portions are small"
As authentic as you can get in Singapore!!!,"Papi’s Tacos come straight from Maurice’s passion for serving home cooked Mexican meals. The food is as close to Mexico as you can get in Singapore and will remind me of home. The food is only surpassed by the vibe where the place is decked out with old school movie posters and the best rap and rnb hits of 90s. Definitely come to this place if you want good food, a passionate chef and host, drinks to warm your soul (tequila) and a reason to come back."
Papi’s serves great Mexican,"Papi’s serves great Mexican food. It’s a small place, very popular, you can book a table online. Inside you sit at a bar desk where the other side of the desk is the kitchen😊 we liked that. Outside there is tables."
delisious delight,"Propper authentic mexican food with great flavors, best place in singapore when the taco cravings hit. Great friendly staff so highly recomended."
Yummy,"I went to Papi's Tacos for the first time in early September before work. I was walking around Raffles Hotel area and just dropped in. The Quesadillas and Tacos were really good! Customer service is excellent, very friendly staffs! 2 thumbs up!"
great,"food is nice, service is good, staff is helpful, everything is just good. Just enjoy the environment."
HELLA GOOD MEXICAN FOOD,"went there a couple of days back, and the food was SO. SO DAMN GOOD. every dish we ordered were all equally delicious, the meat was so moist and juicy, plus the cheese and guacamole was just we got quesadillas and tacos, and it was super worth it. the best part of the experience was that Chef Mauricio was super accommodating to us and his customers, and made us feel very at home although it was only our first time there. wish we took photos before eating but it was too good that we kinda just went for it. will DEFINITELY go back again!!!"
Papis Tacos made my day!!,Amazing ambiance and dishes! Tried their Taco Pescado (Fish) & Taco De Pollo (Chicken) and accompanied with their Jarritos Mandarin Drink! Amazing staffs! Felt at home! Highly recommended! 👍👍👍👍👍 Look for Jeffery their Manager! He will recommend you awesome food from their menu.
Gem you ought to explore!,Excellent food and service with amazing ambience located along a stretch of vintage shophouses. A place you want to just be and unwind!
"Great food, Great service!","This place is a hidden gem and I wouldn’t have known if not for my friends who took me there for affordable and really delicious Mexican food.

The shrimp ceviche was really flavourful and the Chef was really generous with the ingredients. However the star of the night was definitely the beef steak and the beef quesadillas. They were perfectly seasoned and cooked to a juicy flavourful perfection.

To top off the tasty food, the service staff Ivan and Jeff were also really attentive, friendly and accommodating to our needs.

Highly recommend!"
Friendly service with really good honest tasting good,"Rocked up on a Saturday evening without any reservation but despite being busy and booked out, the staff still made room for us albeit letting us know we'll have to leave before the next table comes which was fine by me. Appreciated them allowing us a quick bite despite a full house.

Food was yummy and enjoyed seeing it prepared in front of my eyes as we had the bar seats. Will be back for more."
Awesome fun dinner!,"This place is great- friendly fast service, honest advice re ordering (advised to share the dessert ordered which was greatly appreciated so avoiding over ordering), delicious fresh food, great margaritas! We loved this place, a real gem! Fish tacos were excellent, and the share platter was a must!"
Hidden Gem,Came for the F1 and had an apartment in the street. Happy hour prices were good and great frozen margaritas and mojitos. However food is lovely and fresh. Fish tacos a highlight. Nice service and friendly. Well worth a visit for Mexican.
Awesome & Amazing Mexican Food!!,Cozy place to dine with friends & enjoy the great food.. Amazing staff who's always on the ball to serve the best..!! Gracias for the best food.. Will always come back for more..!! 💕💕
Really good taco's,"Just popped into Papi's and the meal was just great. It's in a street with local restaurants and the chefs' from Mexico. These were one of the best taco's I had in a long time. It's not the tex-mex stuff you'd expect but authentic good Mexican food. I ordered a nice side salad that was home-made. Ice-Tea, margarita's etc to complement the meal. Apart from all the great food places around Singapore this is quite a gem."
Perfect dinner.,I order the skirt steak.The meat was verry tender and tasty. Food and service is just perfect. Thanks. Greethings Dieter.
3 rounds of Holy Grail!,Totally stoked with the flavours. We ordered the platter and had three rounds of the holy grail! Well taken care by the team. Thank you! Definitely our new favourite spot when we need to get away from mummy duties! Love the vibe x
AMAZING TACOS AND SUPERB QUESADILLAS,Awesome food!!!! Love the vibe there! Must come! Must try The quesadillas and their all new Skirt steak.
Great Food and Atmosphere!,"Papi is always there to welcome you with amazing tequila, food and atmosphere! Love the platter and frozen margarita - can't get enough of it! :-)"
Great Hospitality!,"Was there for a small bite and after work drinks and that ended with shots of Mezcals from the team! Good, hearty Mexican tacos and a reasonably-priced happy hour just made our day. The team was Super friendly and welcoming! Fantastico!"
Excellent food and service,This place serves up impeccable food and their service is top notch as well! Great for family and friends! Would definitely go back there!
Definitely the Go-To place for taco cravings!,"Papi's definitely hits the spot with their freshly made tacos, excellent friendly service and warm vibes. Tucked in a corner of Seah street, the cosy little restaurant serves nothing less than big delicious flavours.

Hot favourites are - shrimp tacos and tostadas with generous portions, steak quesadilla, chips and guacamole, and coupled with a mexican soda or freshly made margarita!

The staff are warm and friendly, and they really make you feel at home. Special thanks to Ivan, Djeff and Chef Maurice!"
Great place,Dope place to chill. Should pay them a visit if you are in singapore! Have bice selection of tacos. Serve coronas as well
Best Mexican,"There's nothing else like Papi's here - shoebox taqueria with the best margaritas (none of that sugary bs), fish tacos and esquites. Give Papi a shout when you're there, he's the best"
Amazing Tacos,"taco tuesday paired with their sg beer on tap. Plus the margarita. It will never go wrong. the tacos al pastor, pescado and asada was the real deal! Piña margarita was very refreshing and have enough alcohol"
Best Mexican Food in Singapore!! Mexican Approved!!!,"I love this place. They have the best Mexican food in Singapore and its not really close. The food tastes like what my mom cooks, not sure there is a better compliment. My favorite is the Guacamole, the tostadas and the burrito. The 3 leches cake is very, very good and is often overlooked. Check it out. Oh and the
No hay mejor, viva Mexico!"
Best Mexican In Town,"Okay. I will admit that I am incredibly picky about Mexican food, and it's virtually impossible to find high quality Mexican here (and in Asia in general). This is the Real Deal, and the exec chef/partner - who you can find working in the open kitchen almost every day of the week - is actually Mexican (a rarity here). Everything on the menu is great but the tacos in particular are bites of perfection. Genuinely the only Mexican place I will eat at in this city!"
Great place to chill,"Came here for some drinks after work. The staffs are very friendly. Good food and drinks, very affordable. Will definitely come back."
We absolutely love love this place,"It’s been a while we had Mexican fare, this place takes the top spot for Mexican food ! Awesome service and delicious tacos. We ordered the Papi’s platter which is 8 tacos, corn chips with guacamole and salsa dips. If you can’t decide what to eat , go for the platter.
Yum! We’ll be back soon"
3 weeks in Asia,"We found Papi's at the end of our vacation, the owner was from Mexico and I believe lived in New York for a little while. The first night we went the owner was not there, the service was very personal, you would have thought the owners was there. Small menu with just what you need. Very small space but perfect. Had chips, salsa, guacamole, chix quesadilla, burritos, chix tacos, steak tacos, pork tacos. Mexican sodas, There own bottled lager and a nice local draught, and margaritas. We went two nights in a row, we were greeted and treated like old friends."
"Awesome staff, Good Food","Gourmet and delicious Mexican food! Delicious Mexican Food! The place is great, the food is deliciousssss and the drinks are awesome! Service Super Solid! Good Job Papis!"
Great Mexican Spot!,"Cute Mexican spot, with bar seating so you can see the chefs whip up your food! Quick service :)

Steak Quesadilla was really good! Generous meat pieces and cheesy. A fav!

Tacos ‘al pastor’ were amazing! The pork was
well seasoned, and the mini pineapple chunks cut back on the heaviness and gives a lil crunch and a lil sweetness. Love it!

Slightly disappointed with the Tacos ‘de pollo’, it lacked flavour, but the free sauces they have on each table (habanero/ chipotle / salsa verde/ guajillo) helps.

Agua Fresca was refreshing but a lil underwhelming.

Chips and Pico de Gallo was a great start. The pico was really fresh and tasty AF!!

Overall a nice spot serving fast, and most importantly FRESH FRESH FRESH Mexican food. Definitely will give it another chance!!"
Authentic Mexican Tacqueria and Exceptional Tacos at Papi's Tacos in Singapore,"A real gem in Singapore, for those who appreciate authentic Mexican food, is Papi's Tacos on 39 Seah Street, Singapore 188395. A short walk from the Esplanade MRT Station, South Beach or Raffles Hotel.

This is an authentic Mexican tacquereria, not a fast food Mexican chain!

The indoor of outdoor dining is cozy and reflective of a true dining experience in Mexico and the service is friendly and helpful.

Papi's Tacos makes their own salsas, which are exceptionally delicious. My favorite salsas are habanero salsa, salsa verde and chipolte salsa.

The margarita's are made with authentic ingredients, including agave and freshly squeezed lime juice. You will not be able to drink just one of these exceptional margaritas; frozen or shaken, which I consider the best in Singapore.

This is a special and fun place to surprise your family, friends or colleagues for lunch or dinner.

The executive chef, Maricio Expinoza, is Mexican and a delightful personality and passion for authentic Mexican cuisine and cocktails.

I look forward to my next visit already.

Hasta La Vista!"
Funky mexican,I visited twice on my recent trip. Wait staff attentive & friendly. Food fresh & yummy. I had the fish tacos and chips with guacamole and pineapple margarita (spicey but yummy)!
Tasty but portions too small,Food was tasty but portions are minuscule. we had tried Papi’s private label beer and it was not very good. Too bad - we really wanted to like this place.
Tacos and more,"We had tacos, Quesadilla and burritos. All very fresh and tasty. Whole family loved the food. Highly recommend!"
Tacos in Singapore - Mexiiiiiiicoo,"This address seems amazing for tacos lovers - specially the fish ones (Pescado and Cameron). My favorite - recommended by the chef « Pescado ».
I also tried the « Tacos de Asada » - marinated steak - but cannot kick the « Pescado ». As you understand - this is the must to try.

Service is friendly and efficient.

As you understand, I recommend."
Best Guac and Tacos,"I tried the Chicken Tacos. The chicken is fresh and all the ingredients are freshly made and it was like a Taco Bar. Couldn’t describe it with words because it was fantastic.

Friendly staff and the chef knows how to make the order really fast to be delivered on the table.

You can also make a conversation with the chef while he cooks in front of you.

See the pictures for your self."
Unique & Authentic,"We went for their tequilas and would definitely praise the team, the lovely Mexican Head Chef himself who came to introduce us his team & food.
Freshness of their food items & the vibes is also what you can expect. I love Mexican cuisines here in SG but this one is so different. Must TRY!!!"
This may be the best tacos in Singapore!,"Everything was just amazing, delicious food, generous portion, legit drinks, and attentive staff!

We had Esquites, Papi's Platter (a mix of 8 tacos and chips, pico de gallo and guacamole) and of course, margaritas. The steak tacos were so good we had to get another set. The fish tacos is also a must-try, I thought the fish might be overwhelmed by the smoked chipotle aioli but no, you will be able to tell that the fish was grilled.

We also ordered Tres Leches Cake as it was my friend's birthday. The cake was light and fresh, was not expecting a taco place to be baking their own. And what's not to like, there's Tequila in the cake.

My friends and I totally enjoyed ourselves and this place should be everyone's go-to place for authentic tacos!"
Great food and atmosphere,"Probably the best Mexican food in Singapore! Lots of different tacos and burritos, everything is very taste"
Freshly-prepared Mexican Food,"2 of us visited Papi's Tacos for the 1st time. It's located at Seah Street, by the side of Raffles Hotel.
We had 1 x Burrito Carnitas, 3 x Tacos Chorizo & 2 x Tacos Pescado (Dory fish).
All items were great.
The corn tacos were freshly made & pressed.
The Dory fish was moist & smooth under the batter.
We enjoyed ourselves .. we enjoyed our meal.
Ivan (Papi's Tacos) was most obliging to explain the process & preparation of the food we ordered.
We will patronize Papi's Tacos again."
Best steak/arrachera out of Mexico,"The arrachera tacos are extremely delicious!! The salsas ate great as well! The original margaritas were really good!
The only downside of the tacos are the tortillas, it seems they’ve been frozen and they weren’t warm nor well cooked!
And the prices are a bit high for the type of place it is..."
Papi does know best,Nothing but a truly authentic Mexican cuisine prepared with love and sincerity by Papi & his incredible team. Great fix of good food for the week ahead!:)
Nothing But Awesome,"2 to 3 tacos per serving, variety of margaritas, friendly staff so what’s not to like? Cosy ambience be it indoors or out. Don’t forget the burritos and quesadillas! Short walk to famous monuments in the heart of the city. Always a pleasure to visit!"
