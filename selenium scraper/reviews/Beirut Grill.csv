Must visit,Foods are great !!!. We enjoyed their delicious BBQ. recommended my friends to visit this place. Happy stomach and reasonable price.
Amazing Experience in Beirut Grill!!!,"This was my first time together with my BF and the food was really to my liking, I would say the Dishes are very delicious especially Lamb Kofta Kebabs amazing flavour & texture was on point. The Manager Rhoda even suggested us a pot of hot apple tea to pair with it, surprisingly refreshing and matching with our plates. Thank you and will be back"
Great food & service,"Delicious food especially the mezza platter, mixed grill - lamb chops & kunefe. Excellent service by Ms. Rhoda. We will definitely come back."
Kieran,"Food was delicious, in particular the Lamb Chops as part of the mixed grill . Fantastic value for 2 people and for Singapore üëç"
Nice small libanese restaurant,"Nice place to eat in the Singapore. Even though it is a grill where mainly meat is grilled, it was easy to find many vegetarian dishes, all of them very tasty"
Awesome food and great service,I had a wonderful experience at Beirut Grill. Excellent food and even better service by Amar. His recommendations were to the point and had a great time.Amar got our mocktails customised to perfection and we loved it. Thank you!
Dinner experience,"Dinner with my bff at Beirut Grill for the first time and we really enjoyed the friendly atmosphere , food wise is so far the BEST we had within this area.
We loved the hanging kebabs and cheese pide. Cold jug of beer and a belly dancer entertaining everyone (pretty one)!
Best to seat outside, recommended!"
Excellent food,"We had a great evening with friends with good food and excellent service by Sohail. We enjoyed the brochettes and for the ones who love spicy food, calamari are excellent..."
Not worth over 4 stars rating,So far we did not have the same experience as mentioned in those reviews. They made a mistake with our order and served us the starters (mixed mezza platter) after they served us the main meat courses. Furthermore the Iskender Kebab tasted like minced meat served in a sauce straight from a can. The starters were lacking in taste. The chicken kasba was tasty and the dessert kunefe which took 20 mins was worth waiting for. Total cost plus a bottle of wind was S$248.
"Great service, nice food too!",Service staff were good. Attentive and professional. I paid using a different credit card to the one i used to pay the deposit for reservation. Would the refund for the deposit happen?
"Great food, average indoor ambience","The food was excellent. We especially loved the Tabouleh and Zattar bread. However, they need to work on their interiors... quite run down and does not justify the prices. The outdoors seating was not offered to us as they refused to move the tables around to accommodate a larger group"
Highly recommended place to visit while in Singapore!,"This is my 2nd time visiting this place. As always, the place is very nice, staffs are very accommodating, foods are awesome, and the overall experience is highly recommended. Will surely visit again in the future."
Beef kebab‚ô•Ô∏è,"3rd time to bwirut grill, kept comimg for their beef kebab and mixed grilled kebabs. Staff are truly friendly and courteous, Thanks to Rhoda and her team for the hospitality. Best to recommend on weekends for alfresco seating."
Great Service and lamb Chops!!,"We had Rhoda taking care of us. Fantastic service. Courteous and prompt.
You can tell she wants us to have good time.
Great Bread, meats, esp the Lamb Chops and nice Cold Beers!

So Besides the food, Rhoda added to the ambience and great dining experience.
Thanks Rhoda."
Family dinner,"Beirut Grill stood as a hidden gem along this Kampong Area within the Arab St.
Their lamb chops and Lamb Kofta are the best, juicy and tender, like how we wanted it.. Hummus is a bit dry but loved the creamy taste of their moutabal (eggplant)..
The highlight of the night is our server, Rhoda who from time to time made sure we are having the best of our dinner . She explained well the food and with her we dont need the menu any more!!
Try their hot apple tea after meal and you will love it."
Fantastic birthday dinner made special by the hospitable service,"Amazing and freshly prepared food and when Rhoda heard that it was a birthday dinner, she generously served out cake. Service is especially better and preferable when she is around to make her spectacular pina colada!"
"First Time, more to go ‚ò∫Ô∏è","My friends and I craved for kebab. We saw positive reviews so we tried Beirut grill. We love the food, drinks, ambience and the staff. Ms. Rhoda is very friendly and accomodating. We were so happy with the food and the service so we decided to request photo taking with the chef and the manager. Surprisingly, Chef Marvin and Ms. Rhoda are Filipinos. No wonder the service is fantastic and the food is amzingly good. Will definitely come back to try the rest of the menu."
nice,"i went to try to eat in beirut grill today i‚Äôm so happy becose the manager and the staff are so accommodating , friendly, nice to talk to them, polite and especially the foods are all very nice and delicous. and the plating is no nice to see"
My 37th!,"Whenever I visit SG it's a MUST to go here and dine with my family.
The food is heaven and to die for!!! The ambiance is great!
The staff are not only all good looking but well mannered, friendly and accommodating.
The service is excellent! Shout out to the manager Tita Rhoda! Love yah! ‚ô•Ô∏è And the rest of the gang headed by Amar."
First time - Lebanese Food,First try brunch bowl! Really worth for the first timer who didn‚Äôt try Lebanese food before. Served by chinese waitress named Cyan Ong. Excellent service provided Recommended place!
lunch @Beirut Grill‚ù§Ô∏è,"Very good food and cozy place with super friendly staff, the menu offers a variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian, surprisingly , the food looks simple but really taste good! Good place to recommend!"
Best place to visit in singapore for food and chill,Big shout out for sandeep (best service staff we met in singapore) very kind with words and explained well about menu and recommendations was perfect. I was there with my friends and we had a great time we luckily got outside sitting. food and drinks was perfect as well fast serving of food and drinks. They have some dance performances as well which is very enjoyable so overall experience is very good we will visit again. Highly recommend
Dinner,"Lovely dinner at beirut grill, not surprised to see the place packed on a saturday.
The belly dancer is another good reason to be here aside from the good food ..service is friendly... Only feeeback from us, the place needs new AC.. its too warm inside... Nevertheless we enjoyed .!"
Friends dinner,"Booked a table for 3 , at first got miscommunication on promotion not available on weekends , the incharge was called upon and was able to give us a better option to enjoy our dinner.
Food is really good , the mixed kebabs and iskander lamb stood out the best in the menu!
We did had a good dinner ! Shots are cheap also!"
Horrible service,"I wish I had read the reviews before coming. Weekday lunch, restaurant not even at quarter capacity, but there was hardly a competent staff around. We were ‚Äúattended to‚Äù (if having to get their attention non stop counts..) by a bespectacled older lady and a younger male staff who acted as though it was his first day on the job. Fair enough if it was, which would have been shocking in and of itself given that the poor boy was mostly left to serve the entire restaurant BY HIMSELF. There was no guidance, accountability or direction given by any other staff of the restaurant. He mostly seemed at a loss for what to do. We had to tell him (standing idly) to serve the courses, clear the table, etc - all of which isn‚Äôt really a diners‚Äô job is it?

Needless to say service was extremely slow (the table next to us was also frustrated) and unprofessional. I observed that the same male staff had led a group of diners to the inside of the restaurant but turned around and disappeared leaving them very perplexed (refer to photos). When it came to paying, younger male staff took my credit card and vanished (we sat right next to the register and he was not there). Older lady seemed irate and shrugged us off when we told her that her staff had left our card unattended to. However good the food is cannot salvage the utter lack of professionalism and basic courtesy.

I noticed the restaurant was fitted with CCTV. So if there is any dispute as to the above account, please check your CCTV. Wasn‚Äôt planning to write a review but there were these cards on the counter basically begging for a review. The irony.

Traditional authentic flavours of middle east created by Beirut Grill.,"Traditional authentic flavours of middle east created by Beirut Grill. Lovely beautiful environment with very friendly, helpful and kind people giving tremendously great service."
Great grill plater,We love the grill meat plater. The meats are delicious and succulent. The upstairs dining area is spacious and well decorated.
Yummy Delicious Lebanese Food,Great food. Yummy and delicious üòã Service was fast and efficient. Its worth the price. A must try. Please do come down to experience great hospitality and good food.
"Reasonable, need some attention","Food options were not bad at all. Cooked meat was all good. Presentation was all from another era.

Tables and seats were clearly not measured when designed as the booth seating is too far apart from the tiny tables.

Wait staff bring food to the table, but do not know how to put it on the table. Simiarly, only half of them seem to speak enough English to take an order."
First impression,"This is first trial of Lebanon dish for us.
I could not have a image what type of taste we will take experience with a little fear.
But, Beiruit Grill has made us only enjoy delicious dinner and excellent atmosphere without hesitate.
Firstly I ordered baked cheese as apatite with rose wine.
It gave enough position for 2 persons.
Main dish is Kebab made with lamb meat with rice.
3 types of sauce gave us taste of sour, spicy and like southern island.
The dessert was mysterious, so that we could not find out made from.
I suppose it will be from coconut.
At last, I recommend Ms.Cyan Ong gave us perfect service."
lunch experience,"My alltime place to go when craving for lebanese food, deliveries or dine in.
we had lunch tofay and seated outside , 4 of us just enjoyed the mixed meat platter, spicy grilled chicken and something new for me the kofta brunch bowl.
if anyone looking for good food , heres the place, quality abd quantity of food is really superb, you wont be sorry.
its lovely to enjoy this place when its not busy or over packed.
Thank you for our lovely lunch Beirut,"
Nothing authentic,"Falafel super dry Hummus tasteless from a can Spinach puff under cook, oily and from frozen spinach. Worst arabic food in Singapore, the good review on tripadvisor are very miss leading. Meat platter so so‚Ä¶"
unpleasant experience!,The food was expensive for the quality of food.came back a few years after. Was so shocked with the food that they gave. Plus the plates were chipped. Ordered the khabsa rice and the chicken was wet and tasted stale. The pide tasted like it was store bought and not fresh.
Amazing food and fabulous service,"The food was really delicious, we ordered harissa hummus and muhammara for the mezze and both of them were really good. Iskander kebabs were also quite delicious. Cyan Ong took special care for us by helping us with food recommendations and making our visit memorable. Thank you Cyan Ong!!"
Tasty Mixed Grill,Came here with the girlfriend for Valentine‚Äôs Dinner. Atmosphere was good. Served by Cyan Ong. Good service and introduced the dish and sauces to us. Recommend to try Mixed Grill üëç
A really nice evening's meal,"We were a group of 5. The food was excellent, cooked and served in a timely manner and tasted delicious. Pretty much clean plates all round. Came here on a recommendation by one of the guests and it didn't fail to deliver as promised."
Worth new experience,"The place looks old yet the service and good food justify everything. Love love the mixed grilled platter with the sizzling cheese, goes well with our wine Lebanese Rose' Friendly environment,good vibes to chill, outdoors seating better. Good place to recommendü§ü"
Cozy place with good food,Good restaurant with amazing Mediterranean food . Polite staff ( Amar and other) with good attitude.
Beirut Night Out,Great restaurant with great food and service. Our server Amar was the best. He made sure that we were fine before we left and got us a drink to help digest üëåüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
Dinner experience,5 star to service and food..polite staff and best food.. Best chicken liver... mixed grilled meat and sambousek lamb !! üëåüëç Would recommend!
Service need improvement,"Although the service poor, the food was great.. need improvement on their service as the food taking too long to be served for a restaurant to be only serving 2 tables at that time."
"Good food, polite staff","Compared to other Middle-Eastern grill, I have to say this is my fav. Value for money. Portions weren't too big. Loved the mezze platter, shwarma with saffron rice and kunefe. We will come back again for sure!"
Great Dine In Dinner with Fam @ mid week.,"We booked a dinner rsvn indoors for 5pax & Rhoda assisted well from start to the end. My daughter loves the lamb kofta and oriental rice so we felt it wld be a nice meal bef stepping into Year 2022.

Most of the order items on point with instructions taken care of. Really happy abt that. Only point to improve on is some dishes like the pita bread and the proseco drink which had been ordered was forgotten & halfway thru our meal I had to enquire abt it qgain. Guess there cld be a check list system to ensure all items ordered has been served to diners.

Look fwd for our next visit hopefully soon. We been visiting Beirut Grill for over 10yrs now & happy to be regulars if high quality and authentic taste of food is maintained."
"Great food, great service","Nice ambience in the restaurant with great recommendations on Middle Eastern Cuisine given by the friendly manager, Rhoda."
Delicious food and Good Service,I really love their Mixed Kebab Grill Platter it‚Äôs just soooo good!!! They seem to be understaffed but they can still manage to give you decent service. kudos to roda for being so attentive as always!! Definitely going back again.
Great Mediterranean food,"Amazing Mediterranean food in lively Kampong Glam area, including draft Erdinger. :-) very friendly staff, especially Cyan took good care of us! Highly recommendable!"
Vibrant,The restaurant is in midst of picturesque Arab Street. The place is small and not much outdoor seating. We were lucky to be accommodated for the outdoor seating.. The service and ambience is good. Would certainly recommend
Great Lebanese food,Excellent food and great service from Cyan Ong who provide good recommendation for newbie on Lebanese food. Fantastic Lebanese red and white wine at reasonable price.
Dinner,Great food and excellent service from cyan ong who patiently explained to us on the different dishes and flavours. Kunefe Dessert was lovely
Lunch outing,"Excellent food and very friendly service! If you are after some delicious Lebanese dishes, this place is highly recommended. Make sure you try the Moussaka and the selection of dips. We will be back soon."
Nice middle eastern experience,"Easy process for booking, with gentle reminder the same day, pleasant ambience, courteous service, ... and good food. Very nice experience."
Dinner at Beirut Grill,"My first to dine in this restaurant and was not disappointed at all.
Every dish that was served in our table was really good. From seafood platter to meat platter, we loved it , iskander kebab is new to me and yet it was worth trying, it's tasty.
The place was too busy and still one of the chefs (Filipino) came out to served us Baklava. It was really nice to see them out from the kitchen . Service team were very friendly and despite the limited staff they were able to attend to each and everyone of us.
Over all we had a lovely evening at Beirut grill!"
Good in the past‚Ä¶disappointed today.,"We have visited Beirut on several occasions and have always been impressed in the past. Today, however, was a disappointment. We felt that although we have lived in Singapore for many years, today we were selected as token tourists. We were parked outside on a rainy day when at least one table was vacant inside. We then experienced the old water trick, whereby we were offered sparkling/ still water at $8 and $9 a bottle. I am afraid I wasn‚Äôt with it at that moment and we had to have it! The food was as tasty as usual, but the pita was verging good on undercooked. Certainly lacked any ambiance as we were alone on the pavement whist others were enjoying that inside! Please note‚Ä¶mid-week you will not attract many westerners under current constrictions. There are other places and we may be going to them in the future."
Dining experience,"Many times we wanted to try this place and many times we can't get a table available, alas got a chance to dine in on a Friday evening.
We tried their best selling mixed meat platter , the lamb chops are real good one and the chicken cubes were the best ! It's not dry and was grilled to perfection, sizzling cheese is one of a kind, exciting to watch them serve Infront of us. Honestly, we have to admit that the food is really good!
Staff are very warm and friendly in welcoming us, specially Rhoda who arranged our table and reservation.
We had an evening to remember, we will be back.. and yes , the baklavas are really good."
Great food and service,Food was great. Freshly cook and serve fast. Service was good and staff was friendly. Will come back again.
Awesome,The food is amazing and service very friendly and fast. Some of the specialities have a very special touch that you won‚Äôt find anywhere else in Singapore like the Moussaka and Wine leaves. Highly recommended
"Great food, excellent service.","Starters, mezzas and salad were served promptly. The Tabbouleh tasted refreshing with the lemon juice, and the parsley and tomatoes were very fresh. The Beirut Mezza Platter is a gem - hummus, baba ghanoush and moutabal each has its own unique and complex flavours, yet not overpowering or too rich. Besides pairing them with their fluffy and crispy pita, the Manakish Zaatar went well with them too! The Iskander Kebab is well seasoned and the chicken minced meat wasn‚Äôt dry. Loved the combination of tomato sauce and yogurt! The rice from Shish Taouk was amazing. Flavourful and fluffy, it‚Äôs so delicious on its own. The chicken for this dish is on the dry and tough side but the marination was on point, and the bell peppers were well charred.

Service crew were attentive and very polite. Lovely dining experience! Many take-away orders on a Thursday evening is evidence for the recognition of their food. Will be back again!"
Please visit for good food.,"Good food, great ambience.. We were served by staff, Ms Cyan Ong. She is very cheerful and pleasant looking. Looking forward for our next visit."
GREAT EXPERIENCE,The food was delicious and tasty; the service staff(most specially Roda) were courteous and attentive and the ambience of the street was magical.
dinner,cyan was super friendly & welcoming :) food was awesome it's my first time trying turkish food!!! would visit again
Lebanese Cuisine,"Restaurant tucked in a corner of Bussorah street serves nice ambiene, good service and relatively good Lebanese cuisine. Portions were large and filling. Highlights were Knafeh and the Moussaka"
Just a very nice time there,"We arrived without any booking and the team found us a very nice and quite table upstairs. Gorgeous food and tasty cocktails, we enjoyed our dinner at Beirut and would like to thanks Amar especially who made our evening very smooth. A lovely address where we like to go again and again. Prices are reasonable for the quality and the quantity. We definitely recommend."
Nice experience,Nice place to have a drink and meat. The guys who work there are so helpful and explained all the restaurant plates. You should visit them.
Dinner,"We had the salad which was refreshing. We ordered the meat grille platter, the meat was succulent and condiments were good. We also ordered the mint tea which was good. Desert was not too sweet. Overall it was a good dining experience, service was good. Ambience was cosy. Will definitely come back."
Nice Restaurant,Have not tried Lebanese cuisine before. Not sure if it's authentic. But restaurant has great ambience and staff provide great service especially Ms Cyan Ong who is patient and offered to recommend from the menu. Will definitely visit again!
Everything was good except the Kunefe,"The food was really tasty and we were enjoying it until the dessert was served. The bottom of it was black and burnt. It was also not sweet. Also, the restaurant staff were not very attentive in clearing the dishes."
Amazing food and experience,"You will get a high class experience. The food was amazing. I am vegetarian. The staffs were very polite and patient. The staff recommended me a vegetarian and I loved it very much. I am sharing a few pic of the dish Moussaka.

I will return for more. Thank you Beirut grill"
Best ME food with the most friendly service ever in Singapore,"Beirut Grill is by far the best restaurant we have tried for ME food in Singapore. As a family we have been to the restaurant multiple times but during lockdown we have never been disappointed with the freshness and quality of food. Being a vegetarian I have always struggled with options, but at Beirut there is so much for a vegetarian. Their mezze platter and moussaka are too good. My kids can't get over the Shish touk.

And if Rhoda is around, you're perhaps in the best hands if confused with an order. She is the epitome of customer service. On father's day, and a couple of other special occasions, Rhoda was super helpful in crafting an order for us that catered to everyone's needs. She even sprung a surprise by adding a special dessert to the order. She's amazing!

Overall, Beirut is our go-to restaurant for ME food! It's the best choice you can make!"
Best ME Restaurant,One of the Best Middle Eastern Restaurant in Singapore. Vegetarian friendly. I have visited this restaurant several times with family and friends and enjoyed their food and good spread of liqueur & wine. Very friendly service.
Go for the grills. Avoid the underwhelming hummus,"The hummus is not something to be excited about even though they have many range of hummus. The grills are good. If you want to order the Fattoush salad, check with them what type of lettuce they use - on menu it says Romaine but when it was served it was the cheap ice lettuce. Luckily they were kind to waive it off the bill. The service was ok, they made an effort to check if the food is ok. Go somewhere else for middle eastern food. We went to this place because we thought that it has amazing hummus as what they have advertised. Will I go back? Nah."
Wonderful Sunday evening with friends,"We visited Beirut grill on 12th September 2021. We had a wonderful outdoor dining experience, and the service staff were attentive to refill our glass of water regularly. The mezze was flavourful, and the falafel exceeded my expectations. Never had I have such a falafel with a thin but crisp shell, and the insides well spiced and fluffy - usually the falafel from neighbouring establishments are rather dense and refried. I enjoyed the lamb flat bread and the desserts was a perfect end to the meal. Keep up the great service and food!"
Dinner with friend,"We visited this place as per recommendation from another colleague; and would agree that Beirut Grill serves authentic Lebanese food.
The hanging kebabs are really the best , no doubt their best selling, it's a must to try also the sizzling cheese .
Special mention to Rhoda for the good service ."
Great Mediterranean Food,Service was good and food was awesome. If you love Mediterranean food I would strongly recommend here
Good food and atmosphere for a causal chillout,Shout out to Amar and Sameer for the excellent service. Provided recommendation when we have trouble deciding on the food and drinks. Provided food Explanation on the ingredients and cater to your restrictions.
Prompt delivery service with great food.,"Had ordered my favorite food during my Quarantine Order stay. Got it delivered promptly with an amazing personal notes too, that made my day even better. Kudos to the team. and will return to dine in as soon as i am released from here!!"
Lunch review,It was my first time in Beirut Grill.Awesome food and ambience. We were extremely happy with the service provided by Cyan Ong. She took the time to explain the dishes we ordered and made us feel very comfortable. Thank you Cyan for going the extra mile.Loved the brunch bowl which was not only healthy but yummy. Overall extremely satisfied with our trip here.
Great place !,Visited with a group of friends for a birthday celebration‚Ä¶great service by Cyan Ong and delicious Lebanese food with both veg and non-veg options‚Ä¶good value for money‚Ä¶
Decent food but pricey,Overall food was good. Their dips and starters are generally good. Baklava and Shashuka were not great. I wouldnt order again. Kunefe was very rich but it need to be fried longer and made crispier.
Pathetic service,Ordered online through the website and was charged. Delivery didn‚Äôt arrive and tried to call - number on the website is not correct and called the number from google maps more than 10 times but no answer. My wife finally got a response on the chat function which then just stopped responding. Finally 2 hours later we got a call as we were going to bed with no apology. We had friends over for dinner and it was highly embarrassing. We were charged and still haven‚Äôt been refunded!
Service wasn't Great,"I was there on Sunday evening (18 July) with friends. Food and drinks were yummy. However, we were disappointed with a particular service staff who wasn't very nice to us. When my friends and I came in, I asked her if we could sit outside, she rudely said that all seats were reserved and as per request. Secondly, when she was pouring our glasses of water, I asked her for the menu. Again, she rudely replied that there would be someone coming to pass the menus to us and told us to wait. Lastly, when she served our wine order, she asked if we were waiting for our bill (like she was kicking us out when she just served our second round of drinks). When we asked her for the menu again so we could order some desserts, she gave us a ""WTH"" look."
Pleasant And Amazing Service,"Kudos to sameer who served me and my fianc√® , Very friendly and pleasant personality, Alert and very helpful. Food Was Nice ,‚Ä¶. Enjoyed My Time."
A delightful evening spent at Beirut grill,"We went to Beirut grill in July 2021 for dinner and ordered apple and mint teas, a pastry platter, a haloumi salad and kebab platter. The pastry platter is to die for and the lamb pastries were out of this world. Highly recommend! The tea is fantastic and refreshingly unique in the taste and texture, and is a heavenly experience. All in all, well worth the money, time and effort!"
Good food & service,Was here for lunch. The food is absolutely brilliant & staff very friendly. Will definitely be revisiting soon.
Long waiting time,"Visited Beirut Grill on a Public Holiday (Hari Raya Haji). The restaurant was busy but even then, the staff were attentive to our needs and their service was good. Only complaint is that we waited for 40 minutes to get our food and the food wasn't served all at once at our table. I got my plate first so I waited for my family to get theirs and while waiting, my food went cold."
Good food + good service= happy tummy,"We had an early dinner for 5, its was fully booked and we are glad to get a table inside . You can see that the place are busy with diners and take aways, at first it was difficult to get staff attention but then that did not disappoint us to continue with our dinner.
Its true that this place serve good food and fresh breads, we have 2 meat platters , dory fish, grilled chicken, sizzling cheese, kibbeh and 3 salads, meats are really good that we ordered another round of kofta.. for dessert we had baklava and kinefe with arabic coffee.
Service maybe slow but it did not kill the experience, food was served on time and friendly staff."
Great food and ambience,Went with my wife and son. Food was great. Some of the best falafels and humus I have eaten in Singapore. We also ordered some chicken wings and salads. Good service. Prices are reasonable. Definitely going back.
Good experience,"My second time visiting Beirut Grill. Felt adventurous so ordered 5 types of Lebanese food that we had never tried before - tabbouleh, hummus, kanefe, warak enab and iskander kebab. They were foreign to what I am used to and challenged the flavours I am used to. but this is not anyone's bad and I was glad for the experience. Kanefe had a very amusing texture but a bit too sweet for me. Staff were friendly and attentive, food was served fast."
Reliable old favourite,"We have enjoyed Beirut Grill for years, and it's consistently good. Some mezze, the mixed kebabs (with minced lamb, lamb chops, chicken and beef), and some wine make for a great date night. They deliver now, so we had been ordering at home, but you can't beat the Arab Street vibe. Staff are friendly, the correct any errors quickly, and the chef comes around to check that everything is good. We'll keep coming back."
good service & food is great,"My first visit to this restaurant. Met their restaurant Manager Ms Rhoda, her service was excellent even though we did not have any reservations she was friendly and got us a comfortable corner to dine in. Food was good and her recommendation of dishes was spot on."
Great food and excellent service,"Making reservations was a breeze using Chope. And thankfully we did because the place was packed throughout the night. We were served by the lovely Cyan who was warm and helpful being at arms length the whole time attending to our every need. In fact, all the servers were very responsive and service was just excellent. Food tasted great with special mention to their Mousakaa and Sizzling Kefalotyri Cheese. The latter being so good, we had to order a second helping. The only downside to this place is that it took us 45mins to find a parking because lots were scarce in that area."
"Yummy Arabic Food, Great Service","Despite the Saturday evening crowd, we (group of 4) managed to get seated promptly. Shout out to Cyan Ong our server for the quick, friendly and excellent service. We ate mostly vegetarian which was delicious. A great place to go if you want to try Arabic food."
Introducing Lebanese food to our Singapore hosts.,"We were a party of 5 and two vegetarians. For
our Singapore friends it was their first experience
with the Lebanese cuisine. Vegetarian dishes were served first and this was followed by the Grilled meat dishes. Our friends enjoyed the vegetarian items more than the meat.
Service by Amar was good and the staff looked after us well. Will not hesitate to recommend to any uninitiated guests. Look forward to trying many more items on the menu.
Baklava seemed tiny and a bit dry. We have had better ones in Germany and Morocco."
Good food,We enjoyed all the dishes- vegetarian and non vegetarian. The kenefe was perfect... not too sweet and very flavorful
Great food and service. The,Great food and service. The chef brings an authentic feel to the food and Amar has been so great at making us feel welcome and looked after.
"Good food, great service!",Was here with my girlfriend yesterday and the place was packed and we didn‚Äôt have a reservation. The staff was very pleasant and told us that we could wait upstairs and have drinks by the bar while waiting instead of waiting by the roadside. They got us seats as soon as they were available. Highly recommend. Many thanks to Rhoda for her service! Very professional!
"Beirut Grill, Bussorah St, Singapore",Very delicious sumptuous sunday lunch at Beirut Grill. Visually beautiful food presentation! Would love to come back again.
"Great service, good food and nice ambience ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è","I went there for dinner on Valentine‚Äôs Day and was served by one of your staff namely Rhoda. Food was great. Ambience was great too. Your staff Rhoda served us with a smile and great service. She also went beyond that by giving a flower for the occasion. She also served us with patience and I wasn‚Äôt sure on what to order on that day.
Overall I had a good dinner with a smile by your staff. Good job on having a staff like her that make us diners a good time to end the day."
Lovely Valentine‚Äôs Day lunch with fam,"We were prompted ushered into the cosy restaurant and we were at once charmed by the simple but elegantly decorated place.
Ordered mezzo platter of hummus and were wonderfully whizzed away with the mixed of herbs and crunchy pomegranate bits served with warm flat bread. Chicken Shawarma was nicely done with good mixed of spices. Fries were also served which came as a surprise to us. Fattoush was filled with crunchy vege and pita bits. Kefalotyri cheese came in a hot plate and caramelised onions literally melt in the mouth. Mixed grill kebab platter was a tad salty and dry. Other than that, it was a memorable lunch."
Take out experience,"I've dined in at Beirut ever since they first opened their doors in Singapore and they've never disappointed me. I called the restaurant directly & ordered for take away on 24th January. Food was amazing. Customer service was excellent. I would personally like to thank Rhoda, who took my order. She was very pleasant to talk to and made sure that she got my orders right. She even went the extra mile by informing me that the delivery guy is on the way to deliver my food. Thank you Beirut for employing such a wonderful staff. I would highly recommend Beirut for your next dinner session with friends and family."
Best Lebanese Restaurant on Arab St,"I've been to many of the Lebanese restaurants here and I always see myself coming back to Beirut Grill. The mixed grill was full of flavour and our host Amar was attentive, friendly & professional. 10/10"
