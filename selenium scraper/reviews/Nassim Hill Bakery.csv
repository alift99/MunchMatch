"Chill, casual eatery with all the standards for brunch and lunch","Trusty standby in orchard road area with an ""everything"" menu for western style brunch and lunch. In keeping with their ""something for everyone"" menu, they offer a variety of seating : inside or outside, bar height or regular height tables, communal vs individual tables, Very friendly staff. My only gripe would be that the food for the table doesn't arrive together or in any particular sequence, and some requests (e.g. for ketchup, more drinks) need to be made 2x."
Overview,"Best food I had in a while, brought my friend here and just realised how nice the atmosphere it is; how nice the staff is. Always went for my usual orders the chicken pesto panini with sweet potato fries. Muah! Chefs kiss"
Nice food but pricy,"Had breakfast on Christmas Eve. Nice food but a tad pricy, $30+ per pax. Service staff were ""busy"" and tend to not at customers. You have to walk to them to get their attention. Note the place was only half full. Good for occasions."
delicious and happy!,"foods are nice especially T-bone steak is tender and tasty. prices are reasonable. we enjoyed the night. special thanks for Mr.Denzel, his warm hospitality made all of us happy, thank you Denzel!"
Great food,"Great food for a get together. Just a little feedback, lower music for better conversation with friends"
Tasty bite,"My go to Cafe in Singapore for the past 5-7 years. Superb eggs dishes, particularly love the shakshuka, eggs Benedict, waffles & the detox salad. The salad in particular is superb, with fresh ingredients including avacado, mixed greens, a variety of nuts & a delicious tangy dressing. My family love the Ag Li og Lio here, with the mushrooms. Also like the truffle fries. Mostly everything on the menu is good. The place is definitely worth trying."
Love @ 1st sight! :p,"Simply love this place when I first patronized on 04/11/2022 with friends and have repeated visits on 16/112022, 24/11/2022 and 09/12/2022 haha...the staffs are friendly, food are yummy and great atmosphere."
Good place for a good meal,"Our server was warm annd friendly. Because I was using the Chope voucher, she helped to check the price of food we ordered against our voucher value. Appreciate that. Food was delicious. Love the sweet potato fries and dipping sauce."
A great time!,It was my birthday and I wanted to spend it with my partner as a good time but on a budget! Looking at their reviews it was certainly worth a try. Came on a weekday afternoon for their dinner service and was pleasantly surprised at cosy rustic decor and my partner was pleased with the choice of music played. Ordered the Porterhouse that came in huge serving enough for two and the pumpkin soup was the highlight of the meal
"Decent food, poor service","Had lunch here with a friend. The food was quite good. We ordered the Cheese Crusted Steak Sandwich and the Hot Reuben Sandwich.

The service, however, was quite appalling. Staff generally did not care about diners. It took a long time for us to order. Also, the timing between dishes was ridiculous. My friend had finished her sandwich and mine still didn't arrive. We tried to get the service staff to check, but they were talking among themselves and did not look at the customers in the restaurant.

I wouldn't recommend coming here given the poor experience we had."
Not horrible but not good,"We ordered pasta, pancakes and pizza. The only decent dish was the pasta. Out of the 3 pieces of pancakes, 2 were pale and undercooked. Pizza crust was dense and hard. Would not go back again unless for their apple crostata."
Delicious food,The food was really good. we somewhat ended up ordering 3 dishes with bacon and enjoyed all 3 thoroughly. The service felt slightly lu slow seemed due to short on staff.
Nice place for friends get together,"Nicely located, nice decor and small car park available Mix of all, bakery, finger food, bar etc, nothing favourite though so far for me"
Service & Cleanliness,"Service was alright although we had to repeat our request for children's cutlery to several wait staff as each one of them seem to have forgotten our request. For some reason, the floor area was sticky that day too."
Going downhill,"It used to be one of our favourite go-to restaurants. Food used to be delicious, portions satisfying, service never a star, but decent. Went there Friday evening, was practically empty, guess other customers tried a ""new menu"" or is there a new chef?

Fried calamari tasted like they were kept in fridge and warmed up. Not good. Quesadilla were soggy and running. Chicken was almost underdone and so bland, not even a drop of salt. My wife's rack of lamb was overdone and, on top of things, only 2 chops were on the plate, in the past they used to put 3-4, and now only 2 thin ones and, once again, tasteless. We left without trying dessert.

What a shame, how quickly it went from very good to never will return there...."
Blissful dinner,Tantalising and yummilicious good food. The male server missed out my son’s Mac and cheese and he had to wait for 1 hour and 15 min to finally dig in.
Great Restaurant,The food was lovely and family friendly. The restaurant was clean and staff were friendly. The location was easy to find.
Not recommending or going here again,"Never going or recommending anyone. We used to go to this place coz it's dog friendly but our last experience was really bad. The food quality has definitely gone down. The bread basket came up with dry bread unlike the usual soft buns and when asked for that since I saw other people still eating those buns, I was told they ran out. We ordered bacon as an add on which came almost 15 mins later after 2 reminders when the main was already cold. And ofcourse the staff never bothered to come outside so I had go in twice to remind them. This is despite the fact that I paid first as I wanted to make aute the staff keys in the order coz in our previous experience they have forgotten orders. On top of this, mocha came with what felt like cheap really awfully sweet chocolate syrup and when I wanted to highlight this to the staff, they were talking to me over another customers head standing with bad body language no smile which I think is really rude. The staff hardly smiled which shows their motivation to work at this place. And lastly, the table and the area underneath were badly maintained. I understand this is restaurant known for experience n ambience, atleast make sure the tables aren't rusty and rickety. Overall, bad experience!"
good food and coffee,"location not really convenient but it's worth the visit. food portions are generous. ordered a Nutty Salad, Poutine and Lala in white wine garlic butter. coffee was great. used a $35 for $50 voucher."
Nice ambience with good food,Enjoyed ourselves in good food and nice ambience. Tiramisu is fantastic. Would definitely order it again. The cost of the food is on the high side as the portion served was lower than expectations.
Lovely breakfast,Went there with a colleague. Service was great and food was tasty! Ordered the eggs benedict and love it! Very comfortable seating. Carpark is convenient.
nice food and ambience,"The food was nice and the ambience was great for relaxing or just hanging out. Very quaint place with a grocery shop next door if you wanna buy some groceries. If you wish to have brunch and breakfast options, you can arrive after 11 because you can choose between mains and breakfast. Parking is limited but is okay if you go early for breakfast."
Could be better,"I often visit Nassim hill bakery but realised lately their service worsen . The waitresses were busy chatting among themselves than to take note of us waving frantically for them. I asked for lettering to celebrate my friend’s bdae but sadly they refused to use the chocolate they use for piping donuts and tried to use chocolate syrup , of course it turned out ugly so we used their ugly birthday sign. Manager also didn’t appease us after what happened."
Good cosy place,"It was a nice place in Tanglin, a bit on the offskirts of Orchard Road. The food was good albeit quite pricey for the portion. Would be better if prices can be lowered.
A bit hard to get the attention of staff as well, because they were all at the bar area."
Super delicious !!!,"First time was brunch it was so good so i decided to go back for the dinner, it was equally good as well, reasonable price and cozy environment, will definitely head back for more."
Food definitely punches above its weight!,"It’s been a while having lunch at Nassim Hill Bakery; but the offering for lunch was simply amazing. Had the garlic butter La La, Aglio Olio pasta and the Reuben. Would have ordered more if the stomach didn’t tell me to stop eating! Oh! Happy hour is 9am to 9pm. Just a great day out!! 100/10 if I could rate it."
Food and service is just terrible,Went there with my girlfriend. Waiter sit us down and forget about us. Food came after we order and pasta is diluted. Totally not worth the price that was listed.
just as i remember,the food was delicious. the staff were on the case the music was too loud overall it was how i remembered it.
Always love their food,"My partner and I have visited Nassim Hill Bakery for at least six times now. Every time we visit or try something new on the menu, it always tastes good. Never once have we ordered something and felt disappointed. Worth the money and worth the visit. Would recommend!"
Average food,The service is ok but food so so. The poached eggs r tasteless. French fries is salty and taste like frozen French fries. The chili crab spaghetti is a failure. Taste like instant noodles
Best in class,"Incredibly consistent kitchen. I’ve eaten here more than 50 times in the past 3 years. Have avoided reviewing until now for selfish reasons - leaving Singapore so no longer worried about getting a table in future :)
Younger front-of-house members’ service can be patchy but being pleasant goes a long way - and the pandemic has been hard on the sector.
The food is as fresh as you would expect in a bakery, cooked in full view. Not the microwaved mediocrity that this category of outlet is known for.
Personal favourites: Caesar Salad, Ruben Sandwich."
Super as always,Brought four new frens to check out NHBBB… and none were disappointed. Food and service were great! Thanks again team NHBBB
Breakfast at Nassim,Good food and drinks. Recommended by friends and good atmosphere. The bread is good and can buy back.
Prawn Quesadilla was the Best I ever had,Roomy atmosphere though going to the bathroom was difficult because had to use the one in the carpark through outside stairway. Staff could pay more attention to needs of customers instead of keep talking with one another. I like their happy hour for 12 hours - good bargain
Excellent Food & Services. Great Value too !,"All food looks good, taste good, hope to try all of them at 1 go. Definitely will visit again! Highly recommended !"
First Time Dinner Visit,"Food particularly the Nutty Crab, Fish and Chips and the Roast Beef Sandwich was very good. Fish in the Fish and Chips was very fresh. Too bad the Burrata Pizza was not available but the Hummus dip was good.

Service was very pleasant - we had one wait staff who was very jovial and happy. Great to see that especially during this trying period."
Repeat satisfactory experience @ Nassim Hill Bakery,It's been a while since I was at NHB. The F&B sector here isn't always consistent and constant in quality of food and service. Happy to note that NHB has maintained its standards. Had a lovely reunion with old school friends over lunch.
Wonderful Experience!,"Great service from the staff!!! They are really friendly and accomodating to the use of Chope vouchers!!! Love their kaya donuts, scones and choc chip cookies! Yummyyy!!! Will be back soon!!!"
Amazing brunch,Service and food was excellent! The staff was patient and joyful even though the restaurant was buzzing with people. Kudos to the chef preparing the food. Every dishes we had was amazing! Special mention on the bakeries too.. was way too yummy!
Impeccable Service,"Served by Eve, make my day, my guests were very impressed with her personalise service, her food recommendations. Foods were good and other staffs were good with their services. Alan Tan"
Family & pet friendly place.,Lovely place to dine with family or girls night out. The staff are so friendly and food is great plus value for money. They are pet friendly too😁
Might be the best scone in Singapore!,"My friend and I visited for brunch on a Sunday and thoroughly enjoyed the food at Nassim Hill. I started with a scone because I'd heard good things, and the reviews were not wrong, it was excellent, quite possibly the best I've had in Singapore! It was soft, fluffy and moist, with a good outer crust, and the blueberry jam and whipped cream served along with it was fantastic! It was also huge, and great value for money, only $2.80, warmed up and with the jam and cream, pretty amazing if you ask me. We enjoyed our main meals as well, my friend loved her crab cakes benedict and my bacon and cheese waffles were crispy and very tasty. Desserts were excellent, I tried the apple crostata which was fully of cinnamon and had a perfectly flaky crust, and was envious of my friend's yummy looking brownie. They sure do their baking right! Service was friendly, though they were very busy and definitely understaffed, the servers were still kind and helpful, when we managed to get their attention. A great brunch spot for sure!"
Amazing Ladies Night meal and drinks!,This is the best kept secret in Singapore! Ladies Night on Wednesday and Thursday evenings is always a treat whether you have one friend or five! Great service and nice people who run this quaint restaurant.
Food is not fantastic,Ordered the chef’s’ recommendation - french toast and cheese sourdough burger. Its not awesome as it sounds… definitely not worth the value. $$$
Awesome food as always,3rd visit here and for the Ladies'Night again. The food has always been consistently good and service as well. Pricing of food is most suitably well priced and portion is always generous. Love the sour dough bread with the freshly churned butter. Will definitely be back!
Brunch @ Nassim Hill Bakery,Fantastic Services and staffs are able to recommend their dishes and showing me the photos too. With the use of chope vouchers it makes it so affordable.
Colleague’s farewell dinner,"- Very attentive staff - Excellent drinks and food recommendations (all-rounder red wine to match the steak, Brussels sprouts and calamari, in-house bakery’s donuts to match Yuzu breeze)"
Teatime,Finally made it to try the Savory Cheddar Waffle ! Truly delicious served with sourcream and bacon; ordered the filled doughnuts too. So good that we ordered more of kaya filling for takeaway. Will come back for the sweet waffle next round.
Breakfast,We have asked the staff for recommendation for breakfast. It was good and yummy. Love the bakery items too. Not too sweet.
"5 stars to service, 4 stars to food, 2 stars for bakery","Me and my family of 5 dropped by your place for dinner last Sunday. It was quiet with only a few tables. We were aware and were informed by the staff of the separate tables seating and no mingling across due to the heightened measure. We thought it would be quite a hassle to dine and share our food as our family were seated apart. Our 2 girls were by themselves, my wife and our young boy at 1 table and i alone at another table.

However, the tall lady attended to us made everything such a breeze for us to dine as a family. Her suggestion of food was spot on. The fish and chips was 1 of the best F&C my wife has had for a long time. The classic burger patty was well seasoned with small chunks of quality beef texture instead of typical minced patty. She recommended the picanha steak to pair with 1 of the reds and it was excellent.

I did not expect a service staff would even suggest to split the portion of food so each table was able to share and enjoy without us stretching and passing plates all over. However, I did not know that her good intention would land her getting ""reprimanded"" by your baker. I was seated just next to your bake section and it was so quiet that I could see and hear what he was saying to the lady.
It seemed that our request to cut out the pizzas to another plate was a great burden to your baker that he was rude to your front service staff when she past him our request. He threw the kitchen tool and was grumbling somewhat of I hope it was not profanity to the lady. The scene was unacceptable and nobody should deserve that kind of treatment.

My hats off to the lady as she served our pizza, she was professional and no one would never know what she had just gone through if I did not witness it myself.
I did not manage to get her name but I would like the management to realise what a great asset you have for having her as part of your front service. I hope you will take actions against rudeness especially at work place. Ultimately, unhappy staff equates to disappointed customers."
"Good service, Friendly staff",The staff are very friendly & helpful. Food is great. Bonus point as I purchase the Chope deal so there's 30% discount which is a great saving!
Cosy and great service from Eve!,"Love this place, our first time here and so pleased to have met Eve who introduced us to the various pastries and of course we brought home the scones and donuts which tasted so lovely! Their classic burger was juicy with string fries and the cheese crust steak sandwich was delicious!"
Great food and service,"A dog friendly place to dine with family. Food were good.
But I would like to especially compliment their TOP NOTCH service and warm staff. They were so attentive, helpful and dedicated. You thought you will only receive such service in European countries but no, you can experience it at Nassim Hill Bakery!
Special shout out to Jocelyn, Ivan and Ganesh. You made me come back 3 days consecutively while I am having an enjoyable staycation in Orchard road.

Kind regards, Samuel"
Terrible service and food just ok.,Sat down for reservation at 12:30. Not even attended to for 30 min. Finally I had to get up to physically walk over and ask for service to order. Food took another 45 min and was not great. Grissle and bone chunks in chicken. Hard to find reason to come back here. I’ve been three times and it’s the same each time- bad service with just oo food.
Nice place to chill,"I and my girlfriend had dinner at their restaurant. We ordered the Lala with garlic butter, bone marrow, pichana steak (medium) & carbonara.

We are amazed with the Lala & garlic, the sauce is well done. The pichana steak is palatable with the Dijon mustard they serve. Cabonara is wholesome, the cream and parmesan is just nice.

Staff are friendly, just like to thank Tang and the crew for their excellent service."
The food is mehhhh...thumbs down,"I have been wanting to dine at Nassim Hill Bakery Bistro Bar. When I finally dine there in March 2021, it was a lacklustre dining experience. The food was at best meh... I ordered the Crabmeat Pasta and Steak Sandwich. Both dishes tasted so ordinary. The ironic thing is they were running at full house on a Friday night. The male waiter who attended to us at the entrance was stoic. He was not rude but you would know that he did not pride in his job. The female manager was warm and friendly but it did not salvage my poor impression at Nassim Hill Bakery. The buttermilk scones tasted very ordinary. I will not return."
Always good for breakfast,"We always end up here for breakfast, it's very good and a great selection of eggs, sausages etc. I have never been at night but breakfast or lunch is very good. But it tends to get busy so booking is advisable."
Great attentive staff,Variety of food choices and amazed with very attentive staff. Our table got strong Aircon but couldn’t change it’s full house. But one of the lady staff tried to change the table for us as soon as there is empty seats. And also asked me to change to warm water to make sure it’s not feel cold. Definitely we want to go back to the restaurant again!
Ladies night!,"Our group had a very pleasant evening here. The rules for dining out were followed strictly by the restaurant so one felt safe. The bright lights were turned on 5 minutes before the shut down time and we were directed outside. Very pleasant service. It was ladies night, free flow Prosecco with minimum spend of $35. Food portions were generous, even half portions were filling."
Amazing night with fantastic staff!!,"Went with the girlfriends for dinner on ladies night. Enjoyed the free flow Prosecco/Rosé. with the dinner. Food was great, would recommend the Calamari, Steak & Eggs, Pizzas and the Apple Crostata. Best part was the friendly staff!! Made our night so much more fun and interesting. Thanks to Sean, Harry, Irfan and Wan Ting for such wonderful service. Can't wait till we come back again :)"
"Good food, Great Service",First time here for brunch. The food was nice and portion is big. Their staff are very attentive and provide great service.
Above average brunch,"Ordered the shakshuka and the cheddar bacon waffle. Coffees as well. The shakshuka portion wise was a bit small and wasn’t hot when it arrived. The waffles weren’t hot as well. But the waffles tasted nice, had a nice and balanced bacon and cheese taste to it. Wasn’t dry at all. They have an extensive menu and we wanted to try other sides and desserts. However due to the time limit, we couldn’t. We’d still visit again to try next time."
"Good food, great service!","I was pleasantly surprised when I decided to give NHB a try again when my friends and I was trying to find a place for Sunday breakfast. I visited the restaurant previously a long time ago, and found the service to be lacking (orders took a long time to come, etc). This time round, I was there with 2 friends for breakfast (9:30 am reservation). We were informed upfront regarding their policy in view of the COVID measure to limit our time spent at the restaurant to 1.5 hours. The lady actually helped us by giving us some inputs on the menu items. One of the friends arrived later, and the waitress who came to help didn't really know the menu well enough, but she did come back with the answer after checking with her colleague. The food was really good."
"Good food, good vibes!","Chance upon this place and we decided to pop by to try! Really impressed with their service!
We ordered the chilli crab pasta, burrata pizza, sweet potato fries, apple crostata and the hazelnut dream cake and 1-1 happy hour drinks!

Overall we’re very happy with our orders! A very nice and cosy place to catch up with friends etc. Definitely a place to go again!"
Speed and food quality starts lacking,"This used to be a great, chilled and good quality place. Increasingly, service is slow, food quality is average and although many staff is runbing around, coordinated client-focussed action is not to be seen."
Ladies night with free flow of prosecco,Came with 2 galfrds to celebrate our birthdays together. We happened to meet up on a Thursday and it was Ladies night with free flow of prosecco for 2 hours with minimum spend. Food is good and very helpful service. We will definitely be back.
Terrible service and terrible food,Terrible service and terrible food tonight. So disappointing after Circuit Breaker. Drinks came late and food cold when served. Mentioned it to waiter who literally felt it and said it seemed hot to him. Food returned and then overcooked. Inedible. Multiple offers of free dessert or coffee. Declined. Discount offered. Declined. Not looking for anything but good food and service.
Overall,"Easy to find parking lot. Good place to date for couple. However, the fries does not taste so good. The service is pretty good and fast"
Delicious food and excellent staff,We love coming here for Sunday brunch as a family. A lot of care has been put into the menu and we love trying new items as well as our usual favorites :)
"Food top, service average, location good","would rate the food with very good. we tried the two available impossible burgers and the kitchen didn't disappoint us. I personally found the spicy impossible burger not really spicy.
The Choco mud pie was delicious and the Bloody Mary (they call it dirty sriracha bl. M) was well prepared. The smoothies tasted good too.

Service: I would rate average: two male waiters were a bit slow to respond, but friendly and needed to be called to get our attention, the female waiter was quick in her response and very friendly.

reservation worked out fine - we didn't need to wait!

In all a recommendable restaurant with good food and drinks
Prices are similar to many other restaurants - need around 120 SGD for 3 persons."
"Long queues, salty food","We reached 15min earlier than our reservation time and was turned away by the restaurant even there were plenty of empty tables. Understandably it was Valentine's and we had to wait for a good half hour before we were seated, even with reservations. However, no attention was given to us until 20 minutes later, and another 20 minutes passed by before we were handed our beverages. Each course also took approx 30min to arrive except for dessert. I guess the restaurant was eager to close on time after all the delays and the staff repeatedly asked if we wanted our desserts even though we weren't done with our food. Speaking of food, it would have been perfect if it was not so salty and the salt was evenly distributed. Some parts of the truffle pizza were so salty that it was truly incredible (I do not exaggerate). Thankfully this wasn't the case for the main course but some parts were still salty while the others remained bland. Overall a very disappointing experience, given that we've visited this restaurant multiple times during off peak periods and they are definitely capable of better food and service ( better prices too, we had to pay a premium for the meal due to Valentine's and a deposit was required to secure seats)."
Valentines,The food was amazing even though it was a very busy evening. The Chef did an amazing job. The staff handles the crowd well too
Please manage an event better,"Please manage an event much better than this. The last Valentines day event was a disaster on 14/02/2020. Food came out late at like one and a half hours late for a freaking appetizer, prosecco also came up late.

Best part was Appetizer and mains came together. We sent back the mains only to get that you all served that fish to someone else. Well done!! I applaud you all for messing up our table.

I heard from your regular patrons that the last event was better as you all offered your regular menus. When stocking up for an event, did yall plan out proper amount of stock to bring in? Halfway thru said salmon was finished. Left one which yall gave it away as we do not want the Salmon to be cold.

On a good side, your Truffle pizza was really tasty. And your crew on floor was doing their best to serve us as I understand they were young folks."
"Good food, but ambience so-so","It was very crowded with almost no personal space on Valentine's day, and it felt as if they were trying to squeeze in as many couples as they could. The truffle pizza was really fragrant, even as I am not a fan of truffle, and tastefully salty. I had the steak done medium but it was a little tough. My partner had the salmon but we were perplexed as to why our serving of salmon was half the size of the one the table beside us ordered."
Non-existent service attitude,"Came for brunch for the first time, and will not return again. Greeted by the black-faced supervisor in black shirt. Order was taken by a trainee and the order got delayed coz somehow, no one bothered with the order. Another group, who came later than us, got their order taken swiftly. Perhaps they need some re-training. Otherwise, they should be replaced."
Rustic popular fast moving brunch place,"It was crowded, but we got our table cos we rsvp-ed. Food came in good time despite the crowd! We ordered 3 mains to share between 2 of us. We couldn't finish the food but we really wanted to try the savoury waffles, omelette and croquette. They were all delicious. bread was good"
Great sandwiches start with fresh bread,Great sandwiches start with fresh bread. Read an article listing Nassim Hill Bakery for their sandwiches and I was not disappointed! Went with their signature Hot Ruben and it was delicious
Laid back Sunday with Great Comfort Food,"We arrived at a very busy Nassim Hill Bakery but luckily I had reserved a table a few days prior for lunch. Service was excellent and attentive, ambiance was just what we needed, casual but a 'buzzy' vibe. Food was top notch comfort food and every plate was enjoyed by everyone, in fact our plates were left clean - right down to the salad garnish for our sandwich as it had a lovely light dressing. This is definitely going to be a regular !"
"Pet-friendly, good service","Brought my family and dogs here for dinner, as we were having staycation nearby at Regent Hotel.
Very convenient as it was only a 4 minutes' walk.
The staff were friendly & attentive, even tho' they were very crowded and we were seated at al-fresco area.
Overall, good experience. Will return again next time for brunch!"
Undercooked steak,"Service was excellent, staff was really friendly and polite. Only downside is that the steak and egg served to us was undercooked. We ordered it as medium-rare (how we usually does at anywhere) but I have never once been served one that’s so undercooked. Almost half the steak was actually cooked and the other rest was not. We thought it’s fine to eat it anyways but realized it was cold ?! Told the staff about it but didn’t bother to change it or cook it for us so money wasted as it was left untouched and thrown away."
Food is great but can’t say for the service,"Nice quaint place for Sunday brunch. The food was fantastic. The Reuben sandwich is a must-try! However, the service was really sub-par. The staff are not attentive and prompt in their service at all. What a pity."
Food was delicious,There is so much to choose from! Really great selection. The food was delicious and the service was great. The restaurant was bustling with so much energy. Great place for brunch.
Good service,"Staff were friendly and nice. Went for business lunch, place was not very crowded. Had salmon omelette. Suggest to share the plate as it can be a bit too much for one to finish. Too eggie. Good touch on the cheese inside the omelette. Burger size is alittle tiny thou."
Great food with a nice ambiance.,Great food with a nice ambiance. They open early which is very convenient when you have young kids. Lots of families go there. Only less positive comment is that the service is a bit slow.
"Great food, great location, great ambience",Another satisfying meal at Nassim Hill Bakery... great place to have a quiet meal in a cozy setting with friends or family.
Great food fare chill ambience cafe,"Had an early 530pm dinner for 3 pax at the cafe as Eatigo had a 50% promo for food. Ordered Grandola Bowl(nuts,cereal,yogurt,berries), Crabmeat pasta tossed in spicy tomatoes eggy sauce, Hawaiian pizza and a chocolate mud pie with vanilla ice cream on the side. Food taste was good and total bill came to $52($80 if no discount). Cafe had a Chillax ambience, will recommend to come during late weekdays' afternoon or early evening to avoid crowds as well for the 50% to bring down the slight steep pricing."
awesome food & drinks.,the pork chop and butter chicken was fantastic. nice conor 1 for 1 beers. I will definitely swing by again.
Impossible burger,Went to this bakery as I wanted to try the impossible burger and it did not disappoint. Friends tried the mushroom pasta which was good. Fish n chips was so so. Overall good light food and service was friendly too.
Thumbs up for this hidden gem.,"This is our first time at NHB, but it will certainly not be the last. A great place for brunch with pals."
Wide variety of menu options at great quality,"Sometimes when you go to a restaurant with a big menu, the food doesn't taste great but Nassim Hill Bakery serves great quality cafe food and coffee. I wish we knew that there was plenty of parking available right next to the cafe on a weekday morning.
Tip: For those with little ones, I just found out that there is a nursing room in Level 2 of the building. The last time, I ran over to Tanglin Mall across the road!"
Gathering with BFF,The place is good and food is nice as the baby and furkid able to gather together. Will visit the place again in future.👍
Atmosphere,"Layout some how messy with dusty display and lighting, and cash registers roll laying on the cash register side."
Place with a buzz,"This is a hidden gem, hidden at the back of Tanglin Post Office. The place has a friendly local buzz about it with plenty of chatter. Food is good and also sells alcohol."
Loud place but good food,"The restaurant is a little bit out of the way to get to. Place is quite big but somehow the conversations were a bit too loud to really hear what your company is saying. Nonetheless, we enjoyed our food - I had the impossible burger and it was delicious. My partner had grilled mushroom toast? and she liked it as well. Service crew was attentive and helpful except for the one time when I wanted to make payment and I couldn’t get their attention. Prices were on the higher end. We would come back again if we are in the area."
Casual Lunch,Place was nice and casual for friends and family get together. Food is good. However the noise level was a tat bit too high. Could be due to the low ceiling and furnishings.
0Good food & service!,Lovely place for brunch menu like Eggs Benedict. The local flavored pastas are very interesting - Chilli Crab and Laksa spaghetti.
All Time Favourite Bistro,"Food and Service are excellent.

So many favourites here...
Breads are to die for.
Very good pastas, the classics like Aglio Olio and Penne Chicken Rosa are done superbly, and then there are the wonderful takes on local favourites that are a must try: Chilli Crab Pasta - All the chilli crab goodness without messy hands, Dry Laksa is heavenly...
I am usually not a salad person but the salads here very well done and a hearty meal - Asian BBQ, Nutty Bird, even a yummy Detox salad!
If you are a meat and potatoes kind of guy like me, don't miss the Poutine, hot Reuben sandwich (corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, on Guinness bread, what's not to like!), even the good old ham & cheese.
If you are craving for a burger but want a less guilty alternative, you simply have to try the Impossible burger here. Done to perfection with a juicy patty, you will sure it is 100% beef. :)"
"Great food, amazing service","Had the impossible burger, much better than other joints and more reasonably priced. I legitimately thought I was eating meat"
Chilli Crab Pasta!,"I’ve been coming to Nassim Hill Bakery for years and have always said I’m gonna write a review for them but never did! Till now!

I’m gonna just cut to the chase and say that they serve the best Chilli Crab Pasta ever! I’m quite a big fan of this localized Italian pasta dish and would order it wherever I go if it’s on the menu. But till this day, I’ve not found another that could quite match up to that served at NHB. It’s just that perfect balance of rich tomato sauce, spiciness, fresh crab meat chunks and al dente spaghetti. Not the typical sweet chilli crab kinda sauce you get at the local zhi char stalls or Chinese restaurants, but a well adjusted one where you know it’s still pretty much a pasta dish.

I have tried all their other items on the menu (there’s a laksa pasta too!) and they are all very good but this review is going to be just about the chilli crab pasta. And their service! Which is great! Lovely friendly people that serve with a smile always.

It’s packed on this Thursday night that I’m here, so I think that speaks volumes about this lovely establishment as well. So make your way here soon. You won’t regret it."
Good,"Whist it was crowded and packed and we almost didn't have a table...the person in charge did manage to secure us one, which was a nice touch. I like the food, and would try their other items on my next visit"
