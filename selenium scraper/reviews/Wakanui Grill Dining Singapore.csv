Delightful experience,"Had a delightful New Year Eve's lunch here. Food was good, excellent ambiance, place wasn't crowded during our visit, and staff are gracious and friendly. Compliments to Anand for the wonderful and attentive service."
Best binchotan lamb chops!,"Hands down the best lamb chops in town! Meats are cooked over binchotan charcoal, giving it a nice smoky finish. Restaurant ambience is lovely for a quiet night out with loved ones or business setting. Last but not least, Peter was a great host!"
Impeccable Service and Grilled Meat,"Lamb rack was superb, a must order for sure! beautifully done for a medium rare. lobster bisque was fantastic too!"
Great food but service was average,"Food was lovely. Canterbury steak was beautifully cooked, and nice soups etc. Unfortunately there was a hair on the shaker, waiters had masks half on (on or off - we don’t mind but make a decision), slow and irritating. It was enough to make it uncomfortable so we won’t be back. Shame as the food was nice."
Beautiful restaurant and great service,"Great service, steak was cooked to perfection and the waiters were on the ball. Beautiful upper class restaurant with a nice atmosphere."
Excellent service.,Very attentive to our request. I love the dining experience at your restaurant. Will definitely come back again.
Lacklustre,Experience rather ordinary and unimpressive very noisy restaurant with lunch crowd reminded me of cha zhan teng in Hong Kong pricey food just ok quality service good though.
A Lovely Evening,"Excellent service, excellent food in a quiet atmosphere with great views of Marina Bay. Could not have been nicer."
Delicious birthday lunch,Went for the krisflyer one-for-one mains. Only the ala cart was available but do note only the cheapest main would be complementary. The lamp chops and steak sandwich was very good and tasty. The grass fed steak was not too bad. Service was attentive and good. Good views of the area and the building itself has good landscaping. Was quiet and nice but the downside is also that most shops weren’t open on a sat afternoon.
Wife - Natalie’s favourite,We both like beef with paired wine . Restaurant atmosphere is casual but with a touch of fine dining . Good place for couple .
Nice family lunch - lamb chop superb.,Nice family lunch. Appetiser lamb chop is a superb must try dish. Set lunch is value for money. Bill was given wrongly to another table though.
"Good food, even better service","Brought my family here for my dad's birthday dinner. Suffice to say that all of us enjoyed the meal. The ribeye was cooked to perfection - my dad enjoyed it, and even my mom who doesn't normally eat beef because of the smell, says that the beef here does not have that smell. Peter, our server for the night, must be commended for his attentive service - he makes sure that every detail is addressed, from the glasses on the table, right down to what to do with leftover steak that is taken home. Thanks for a wonderful evening!"
Excellent grilled meat hidden in One Marina,"The full lamb rack was very substantial. The A5 wagyu was grilled to perfection. The grilled Octopus is just not enough. The potato mash was absolutely creamy, cheesy and smokey. I wish the meats came w gravy or sauce. I suppose its japanese style."
Best Lamb Chops,There have consistently the best lamb chops in Singapore. The ambience is also great - great views of the sea
"Wonderful service, great food and superb location!","Visited Wakanui Grill for the 1st time after a long-overdue Team Dinner - It did not disappoint! Rajaratnam took great care of us from the moment we sat down and was discreetly attentive. The food was fantastic, with the showstopping steak and lamb chops from the grill! Wine was definitely gorgeous and very reasonably-priced (note that parent company is 1855). Highly recommended and I'll be back for more!"
Great food,Had a birthday dinner using Burpple voucher. Added on the lamb chop too. Passionate Yuzu Cocktail was very refreshing. Food was great with attentive service. Thank you for preparing as per request for the candle on dessert and even asking for name to be piped on plate.
Great Experience,Overall great experience. Organised a business with customer. Service is prompt. Ambience is nice. Food is great.
Happy about it.,Good service and food quality. Staff are customer centric and preemptive to explain the detail of items. They are ready to explain and clarify concerns. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a dinning place of satisfaction. The oniy area that can be improved is to put more fabric as decoration to lower the noise level when it is full.
Birthday celebration,Booked via Chope and restaurant watsap me almost right after to provide me with more information. Great service with timely reply. Personalized birthday message on our dessert. We tried the lunch set and it is within our expectations. Thanks for the experience
Fine Dining,"We are greeted with warm service to the details throughout the dining experience. The lamb chop was very good, as what they are famous for. The ribeye was also good. The atmosphere is quiet and stylish., with most of the restaurant full height glass walls overlooking the residence apartments opposite. The whole dining experience is awesome."
Excellent food,"My friends and I had a lovely dinner at Wakanui. The food as always was excellent - the lamb chops were to die for and salads were delicious. We were also impressed by the South African Sauvignon Blanc that was available.

We missed our usual manager Raymond Santos, who has since left Singapore to join his family in Las Vegas. His replacement May tried valiantly to provide a similar level of service. However there some nicks that she needed to overcome, including staff who do not scan the room to see who needed assistance or service as they walk to and from the kitchen. It took us multiple tries to get their attention for condiments or our second bottle of that yummy wine.

On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give them a 10 for food and 6 for service. Good but with lots of room for improvement."
Still one of the best steaks for the price!,Also discovered their potato wedges were great too! And of course the lambchop was awesome too! Been a regular for years now and food quality has been maintained. Kudos!
Good food Good service,"Quality of the steak is good, matched by equally good service. Waiting staff were attentive and prompt to help, especially Arnon. A very good experience overall."
Good food good service,"Food was good, the person serving did a very good job recommending me on what dish to go for. He did make me and my wife felt comfortable as we are not used to eat in such restaurants. There is wide selection in the menu too. Overall I would recommend people to try this restaurant."
Best food !!,Best food and service! Thank you so much for the nice food for my husband’s birthday. It was a perfect day wuth perfect food !
"Great company, good food and service",Excellent service provided with good recommendation on food and wine. Thanks to Haydon for constant good service provided.
80th birthday lunch,"I sincerely thank Wakanui for this lunch, especially for the vietnamese waiter, he has gone extra mile to design and alter the dishes for 2 of us. He has also make my friend 80th birthday a memorable day that he will treasure in his memory and heart. Thank you, Wakanui.
I strongly recommend Wakanui as a nice place to dine."
Dinner,Good food and nice ambience. Wine recommendation was perfect for the food. Staff are very attentive and gracious.
Great Dinning Experience!! Lamb!!,An indeed pleasant experience Dining here on a typical Monday noon time. Great service and great food. Highly recommend lamb chop starter and lamb rack. Probably the best that I have tried! Thanks for giving me a fantastic dining experience
Birthday treat,Excellent atmosphere - elegantly class. Service attentive - good & prompt. Tableware classic & excellently presented. Food up to the price standard.
Flawless Dining,Outstanding service and incredibly tasty food. A wonderful dining experience. Thank you Wakanui Grill Dining Singapore.
Great service,"Service was great and apparently there is a dress code. We didn't know as it was our first time but they understand that and let us in. The staff recommend us some dishes too.
Their lamb chop starters is really delicious! Very small but yummy. Smoky kind of taste. Had the clam chowder (very small portion) and the scallop. Scallops were great. Their ribeye steak is just average. Had better one. Their snapper is ok too - wasn't warm when served and there are bones in it.
Love their dessert the one with mango in it.
All of their portion is quite small and expensive.Love their service even though the food took quite sometime to be served."
Great food and services,The staff there are friendly and provide excellent services. The food is of high quality with no complaint at all! Will definitely return again for makan.
Lamb chops are fantastic,"1st time eating at Wakanui. Had the set lunch which was good value relative to the ala carte.

The appetiser was so-so, the mushroom soup was simple but up to standard. We had the lamb chops and roast beef, the latter was good but not out of the ordinary but really enjoyed the signature lamb chops, one of the best I've had.

I had the yoghurt dessert which was a nice finish to the lunch.

Overall, portions are not huge but good enough for a work day lunch. The wine was pretty good too. Would describe the ambience as more business like, probably given its CBD location. View could have been better though as it would be weird to peer into residents' homes especially at night.

Oh yes, I would give a thumbs up for the good service"
Absolutely Sublime,"Good for special occasion as it’s not the cheapest restaurant for steak but worth every dollar and calorie. Ocean beef and spring lamb were amazing; starters, sides, soups were all delicious and the desserts delightful. Service was attentive and warm though it felt rushed, perhaps due to 2 dinner seatings."
Lunch,"This is my first time to the restaurant. We were greeted by a warm welcome. Staff recommend us their signature Grill lamb rack. To be honest, I’m not a lamb lover, therefore just place for one set to try only. The smell attract us when it was presented. I’m surprised by the taste and tenderness of the meat, it’s really mind blowing. I called it great food indulgence. Very soon coming back again!"
Outstanding,As always the lamb and steak were outstanding - cooked to perfection. Love the sautéed mushrooms too. Service is attentive and welcoming -Raymond is always at the top of his game.
"Christine , You are Great","We went to Wakanui last night at 830pm July 17 2021.

We planned to have a great dinner of steak in a nice environment.

We got both and much more.Our 1kg rib eye was amazing.Christine too was very attentive and always smiling.Plus she knew her product and was helpful with photos.

Thanks Christine.

G Dan"
Fantastic steak and red wine,"Great selection of starters, steaks and wines! All perfectly cooked and well presented. Service was not at same level - definitely room for improvement"
Good food and great service,"We ordered the signature lamb for appetisers, the steak for mains and mushrooms for sides together with the Pinot Noir. We enjoyed the food greatly. Liked the quietness of the surrounds too.

The staff were friendly and special thanks to Christine for her attentive service. My parents really enjoyed the whole dinner experience. Will go back again!"
"Excellent service & delicious meat, limited menu & somewhat pricey","Okay location & ambience but nothing special. Service was excellent, friendly & knowledgeable. Meat was deliccious. The menu itself & the variety/selection is small & limited. The food & particularly the wine is somewhat pricey for what's on offer."
Anniversary Dinner at WAKANUI,Nice foods and very attentive staff. Great ambience but a bit difficult to find the restaurant. Must try - the lamb
Everything was great except for the steak that smells fuel,"Everything (appetizer, dessert, wine) was great except for the steak that smells fuel. Ordered the fillet steak from the lunch prix fixe menu. Didn't make complain as I was with business associates. They had lamb chop and roast beef and apparently theirs were fine."
Grat ambience and good food.,Tried their signature lambs. Grilled with perfection and meat itself is nice with good flavor. Will come again to have lamb.
"The beef is lush, tasty and","The beef is lush, tasty and fragrant. We also like the eel / foie gras n octopus appetizer . Christine topped up the night with her pleasant service n smiles ( beneath the mask ) . Highly recommended 😀"
Nice ambience!,"Food was good, the steak portion is huge. Great service from Mae and Christine! We had a lovely Christmas dinner."
A Wow Experience!,"It was an awesome experience. Found it from the Krisflyer list of dining outlet. It’s a lovely & cosy restaurant well hidden in the middle of a business district. The lamb was really tender & succulent n the fish was fresh n tasty as well. Service was superb as the waiter gave us good recommendations! Will certainly recommend friends to go. Price is on the high side, otherwise will certainly return more often."
"Good food, attentive service.","Good food, attentive service. Will go again. Nice aged bone in ocean beef and the unagi foei gras is a pleasant combination."
Good is good but service is ultra slow,"The steak and all other plates were fairly good and meets their price point. However, it took 40 mins for food to be served. Given that the restaurant is in the Marina Bay business district and lunch hour is precious - waiting 40 minutes is not ideal. Hope restaurant improves on this."
"Good Food, but venue a let-down","Most of the food was pretty good. Had Oysters (good size and juicy), Hot Smoked Salmon and delicious Lamb Chop, but the Grilled Octopus was not tender enough. Ocean Beef was ok, sides of Mushrooms (excellent), Grilled Veggies (fine) but Mash Potatoes, although velvety, could do with more cheese or cream.

They problem I had was the restaurant was very noisy - needs to have more noise-absorbing elements. The loud talking was amplified by the hard surfaces. Mid-way through the meal, I could smell the smoke from the grill and started coughing. It went away after a few minutes, but the ventilation should be checked. I was sitting facing the open kitchen.

Service was good. Staff are efficient.

I would go back and have more lamb :D"
Good dinner and service but smallish portions,"Service was warm, friendly and efficient. Foodwise, it was mainly hits. The sourdough bread was okay, but could have used a little more salt. The soy sauce braised duck breast was good, but the char broiled blue fin tuna was tastier. I liked the three lamb lollipops, but found the portion to be too small. My wife said her beef, which came sliced in a surprising scallop shape, was a little dry, but the wasabi and Christmas Island salt went well with it.

Dessert was hokey pokey, and matcha ice cream.

It was a good dinner, but portions were smallish. Dinner for two, without wines, was around $170. It is a better place to visit for a company event, I guess. The ventilation could also be improved, as the smell of grilled meats was pretty strong upon entering the restaurant. It was good that they provided hand sanitizer at every table."
Super,Very friendly and attentive service I had beef and cheesecake. Both had good presentation and fabulous taste. My business partners also enjoyed their beef sandwiches and desserts.
Best lamb chop,"Wakanui serves the best lamb chops. First time dining at the Marina One and experiencing Restaurant week, Wakanui is a great place to relax and fine dine. To get there take a lift at the back of the building if you are dropped off at the lobby of the west tower. The lift takes you straight to the restaurant surrounded by a lovely garden and a swimming pool. Service is impeccable. There are 10 staff in the see through glass kitchen from the dining area working their magic from sous vide to grilling perfection. There is about 4-5 service staff who provided amazing service with their knowledge of wine and food. Everything from their solid serving plates to immaculate cloth napkins to top end cutlery is certainly there to impress. The petite food portions are creative and top notch made from the best of the freshest ingredients from the grated wasabi to smooth vanilla toffee ice cream. Very enjoyable as long as you are willing to pay the price for an amazing dining experience."
Birthday dinner,"It was a pleasant and great experience. Servers were all very polite and accommodating! We enjoyed our meal and had a really cosy quiet corner.

MUST-TRY (*with stars being our personal fave)
We ordered these and it was well worth the money :

- Char-grilled Eel with Foie Gras *
- WAKANUI Spring Lamb Chop *
- Ocean Beef 21days Dry aged bone in Ribeye *
- Smoked Cheddar Mashed Potatoes
- Sautéed Mushrooms w Caramelized Onions *
- Still water

Bill was about $388 but it was a memorable day. My partner had a surprise birthday ice-cream from the staff and even a song !

Will definitely go back again !"
Updated 1-for-1 Burpple Beyond menu,"Went again! Menu has been updated to 1-for-1 5 course at $98++. I didn’t take more pictures after the first dish oops, but the experience and service has been consistently good- you can use WOW30 to get Burpple Beyond premium membership at 30% off (U.P: $99).
We also topped up with garlic prawns and mashed potato (absolutely heaven), along with 2 whites and left so full! Expect that the bill would have been muchh higher had we not gone along with Burpple Beyond, so we are satisfied.
Lastly, we drove here this time and parking was free (free parking on weekends) so that was definitely a plus."
Will go back again!,"Via the Burrple Beyond deal, got to enjoy the 1-for-1, 5 course set meal that includes Grilled Beef salad, Eel with Foie Gras, Spring Lamb Chop, Kurobuta Pork Belly Confit and Blood Orange Cheesecake for $78++. Brought my partner along to enjoy this with me so this set was really worthwhile.

PS: You can use the promo code WOW30 to get the Burpple Beyond Premium plan at 30% off. This meal alone covers more than the cost of the Burpple Beyond Premium plan so why not tap on it. :)"
Very detailed flavors.,"Very detailed flavors. Both of our starters were really delicate (lamb and salmon), the ribeye was perfectly cooked. The lamb was ordered medium rare but came slightly undercooked. However the sides were delicious. Overall great service and great experience. The air con is was too cold so bring a jacket."
dinner,"ordered a steak sandwich from Wakanui and a house blend ice tea to takeaway. sandwich is ok except some fat. what is ridiculous is they sealed the ice tea in a plastic packet and there is no marking to tear open the packet.

then how to drink the ice tea? bring back home use scissors to cut?? the same goes for the orange peel for the ice tea, sealed in a plastic packet and no marking to tear the packet open.

after pouring the ice tea into the cup of ice provided, it was only half filled.

to be fair, i collected the ice tea from The Spot which is one of their restaurants and Wakanui came down later with the sandwich."
Very good all round!!,"Food and service was all pretty good. Spring lamb chop, ocean beef ribeye, Kagoshima Wagyu Fillet and the Chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. Highly recommended."
Ocean beef bone-in Ribeye,The bone-in ribeye was grilled to perfection. The service is excellent. We really enjoyed ourselves very much!
Excellent lamb and Hokey Pokey Ice cream,"Booked the place to celebrate my hubby's birthday. We order 2 starters of lamb chop which is a small portion but seriously one of the best one that we tried. Ordered octopus, eel with foie gras and onion soup. Had the full rack of lamb chop with mushroom as side.
Lamb, octopus, onion soup and mushroom are all very good.
Lamb was grilled till perfection. No sticking on my teeth. No hard and really tender.
Octopus came with a very nice and sour sauce. The tomato, onion and the sliced lime gives a very unique taste and it give a pleasant surprise.
Onion soup was ok.
The full rack lamb was very yummy. Grilled till perfection but my hubby preferred a more cooked one.
We have it as medium rare.
Do not enjoy the foie gras with eel.
I preferred a more saucey kind of foie gras. Like the one that we had in Chez Pap French Bistro and Wine which was grilled with a more meaty sauce.
The Hokey Pokey Ice Cream is the best caramel ice cream that I have tried.
Staffs are very nice and attentive.
They arranged for a small birthday celebration for my hubby.
Nice view for the evening
Come to try it. No regrets."
Excellent,Went to Wakanui to celebrate my hubby’s birthday. The spring lamb chops are heavenly. The meats are awesome. The only dish that didn't wow me was the prawn appetizer. Everything else was a favourite! Service was friendly and attentive.
Delightful,"Excellent food, very helpful, resourceful and good service. They go the extra mile to help us with different wine options and courses they think will suit us better and they nail it each time. It's our second time and it will not be the last.The atmosphere is great."
Always deliver,"I am person who enjoys his meat. I know I haven’t tried “all” the steakhouses in Singapore but in my 3 years here, Wakanui still remains my favorite place. The steaks are simply great and can’t go wrong with any of the choices on the menu. Then don’t forget to order the lamb chop and 1 is not enough."
Excellent lamb and beef,"Fresh ingredients for their Sunday brunch buffet ! Delicious spread of oysters and prawns, lovely mushroom soup."
Interesting Experience,"While the staff and service was good, looking through the wine menu there were no New Zealand wines to choose from."
Fantastic Place ... hidden in town away from town,"Everything is fine, except ..... Can this TripAdvisor web owner change the google map location to Marina One instead of the old rowdy Boat Quay??? Is misleading, and this awesome place in Marina One need a shout out!!"
SO PERFECT!!,This place is one of the best places. Maybe the best also. Nothig wasn't tasty.. Lamp champ is MUST. The Octypus is very delicious too. The service is 10/10 The quality is 10/10 simply awesome place and must visit. The perfection it self👌
Amazing from starter to dessert,"The lamb starter kicked off what was to be an amazing meal. Thereafter, the ocean beef, lamb and A5 wagyu beef was flavorful, juicy and balanced. The desserts, panna cotta and chocolate matcha lava cake were also on point. Will definitely return."
One of the best steak house I have tried maybe the best.,One of the best steak house I have tried maybe the best. The chef knows how to choose the product and cook incredible meat. You can even sit and see him cooking. The service is first class. A great experience. I recommend.
Superb in every way,"As a frequent traveller to Japan I really appreciate the attentiveness and attention to detail that Tokyo restaurants almost always deliver. It's a quest for perfection that doesn't often happen in Singapore ... but it certainly does at Wakanui!
We had the 5 course set dinner - a veritable feast of flavour and beautifully cooked meats from New Zealand,
Their wine list is equally appealing, featuring some of the better Kiwi wines, yet still good value.
Their service is second to none - Ito-san and the team were faultless in every way - attentive but not overbearing.
So well done and thank you Wakanui - we'll definitely be back!"
I will come back for sure!!!,"One of the best grilled lamb rack I have tried. The dining experience is great with casual environment and watching the Chef cooking of you like to sit outside. Few private’s dining room to cater for 4 to 16 pax. Very attentive waiter and waitress and never have your wine or drinks cup empty! The lamb chop @ $10 per piece must try if you choose the beef for main course. The grilled octopus is really good ! The grilled eel with foie gras is very unique preparation ! Lamb rack from New Zealand tasted very different with no smell. Perfectly grilled to perfection with medium well! The dry aged 13 days beef from the grass fed cow in New Zealand is out of the world. Sipping with a glass of Shiraz would be a perfect match ! When we so full to eat any dessert, we have a surprise treat from the house as they said to complete your dinner without the dessert is not complete!! What a service and caring .. will come back for sure .. there are seafood and pasta choice as well! Price is reasonable with plenty of parking space at the basement level."
Impressive!,"Been to many steak places in Singapore over a year and this is simply the best steak house I found so far. Everything is cooked beautifully and the service from staff is terrific.
Must try!
The Lamb chop and beef.
Dessert: Chocolate lava with vanilla ice cream."
Superb !!!,"Once you will find this place (we had to call restaurant, as the complex is really huge), you won’t regret ! Nice casual, but elegent ambience with open (behing glass wall) kitchen. Very professional service, including sommelier (thanks for your recommendation of Napa Cabernet Sauvignon !)
What is a quality of food ? Amazing !!!
Please start from one piece of unforgettable taste of New Zealand lamb chop. This was so great, that we decided to order more pieces extra to our main course :)
Also green New Zealand mussels were soooooo tasty, and last but not least juicy, done in a perfect way (medium rare) so called Ocean Beef Rib Eye. This was the best place to have a dinner before our take off to Europe ! But we will be back !!!"
Great Tomahawk Steaks,"We booked this restaurant for a birthday celebration. Remember to park next to the WestTower. We had the scallops, eel and snapper starters. For mains we had the lamb chops and beef tomahawk. The meat is very well done. Dessert was the Apple crumble. Service is excellent, ask for Sam who can good recommendations."
Japanese Steak,"Was looking for new place and yakaniku grilled. The original place we wanted to go was fully booked so recommended by friend we ended up at Wakanui Grill! Ambiance and room is a bit small and tables are close to one another but we are looking for great dry age steak.

We ordered lamb chop, Dried Rib eye, Grilled white fish and cream spinach.

For Lamb chop must use your hands to enjoy and indeed it was juicy, tender and very nicely done!

Grilled white fish w purée pumpkin is another gem and grilled to perfection.

When the rib eye came we did anticipate great and it was very good tender, taste good but a bit dry. Did we finish it yes we did but we were hoping a bit better and hope next time we will get the perfect to our taste.

Thank you Wakanui!"
Lunch with my Sister,"This restaurant is frequent quite a bit by my colleagues since we are located on the same building, so I decided to check it out with my sis & took the executive lunch set & choose the pan fried cod fish as my main & a lamp chop as my starter, there is also a mushroom soup & bread was provided upon request. My sis had the steak. For dessert I had the early grey creme brûlée & my sis had the apple crumble if I am not wrong . What I like about this place was the service was good . I found a cod bone on my fish & place it at the side of my plate without making any fuss . But the restraunt manager came to apologise. I think this makes its special . Will definitely come again."
Wonderful Ocean Beef Ribeye,"I love dry aged beef and have tried some excellent steakhouse elsewhere. Wakanui dry aged rib eye does not disappoint, it's tender and full of flavour.

We had smoked salmon and baked oyster to start, both are wonderful. Baked oyster has an interesting flavour. Dessert is good as well, hokey pokey ice cream is abit sweet but it helped to washdown the heavy mains.

I recommend this restaurant for great steak and lamb, cool building and spot on service."
Wakanui my best steak and lamb chop experience,"I am here at Wakanui again this time for dinner and the evening ambience with the glass window see-through Kitchen concept plus the boulevard view from high up makes for a nice setting. To top it all, the fantastic spring lamb chop never fails to amaze and titillate my taste buds. Made a new discovery that their Seafood Trio comprising lobster, scallop & fish is equally exquisite and my son who ordered a smaller cut of 350g of aged beef was pleasantly surprised at the generous cut and the nice charcoal grilled taste accompanying it. I enjoyed the large roasted onion with its juicy soft sweet peels that were still moist and juicy.
Would definitely recommend the Wakanui experience to anyone. This second visit convinced me that Wakanui deserves top ratings and once again the Manager Hirokazu Itoh-San was at hand to welcome us and lend that special touch to the night. Oh their dessert - that will be for another review but maybe you should leave some space to taste it yourself."
Great New Zealand meats well cooked but pricey.,"My wife and i decided wanted to go to this restaurant and experience the lovely meats from New Zealand again. We were a little home sick. The restauant is located in the new Marina One area of Singapore which is quite busy doing the day, with all the business's near by, but a little quiet of an evening. The restaurant is well presented, but is lacking in atmosphere. The quality of the food and its presentation was very good, and the meats were cooked perfectly. The overall experience was nice,but not good enough to list a a favourite restaurant."
Fantastic Steak & Lamb Chops,"I was there at the Marina One outlet for lunch with my adult son 2-3 weeks back and we were absolutely bowled over by their exquisite lamb chops. The wagyu steak and the burger were also pretty good and I am looking forward to dinner there again tonight as I pen this overdue review. The service was exquisite especially with the personal touch from Hirokazu Itoh- San the Manager to make our lunch all the more enjoyable.
: Francis Ng"
New location with great improvement.,"The new location is rather difficult to find for first timer. It is almost a standalone restaurant at a large 4th level garden of Marina One, The Heart West Tower. The surrounding is very futuristic looking almost like from a movie set. The garden is beautiful and tranquil.

The first dish served was a simple spring lamb chop. The taste and tenderness of this lamb chop was excellent. All of us were very impressed. The clam soup was full of flavor. The beef ribeye melted in our mouth. I did not taste the fish but has a piece of the Kuronuta bacon was excellent too. The dessert was an unique New Zealand dish which was rather sweet. On the whole, a satisfying lunch.

This is an New Zealand restaurant with a Japanese chef."
Creative and Tasty Food Creation,"I was there for some event and tasted their wonderful creation. The lamb rack was done so perfectly. Juicy, tasty, with the smokey taste from the grill. The kurobuta back out was very unique & refreshing as it's not the conventional version you could find elsewhere. The pandan creambule was a smart creation, taste so local and clever."
Kiwi goodness in the house,"Wakanui Grill Dining, Marina One The Heart: There’s a bit of Kiwi goodness in my work building, unbeknownst to me. The set lunch $49 was an affordable gourmet luxury of an appetiser, soup, a main all finished off on a soprano note of sweetness. The salmon is legendary and perfectly smoked on the outside and tender pink inside. So soft it slid off the knife. Possible one of the best salmon I have had in life. #eatstylishtravelstylish"
Good service,"Tried this new restaurant. It’s a NZ restaurant with Japanese influence. Tried the corporate package - salad, beef and lamb and dessert plus wine. Food is great. Service is top notch. Very attentive staff."
"Good service, nice ambience and great for meat lovers","My company moved to Marina One a few months ago. Never though of a steak for lunch was it was too heavy. However I suggested going with a colleague to celebrate an event. Nestled on the fourth floor of Marina One West Tower, there is enough greenery outside of the restaurant to make you feel at ease. I had their set lunch. Appetisers was their signature lamb chop. It was a very small piece and it was excellent. I had the fillet for the main course which was also very good. Ice cream dessert and a flat white to end the meal. Was told that the owner is also a shareholder of Ola. So mention to the attentive service staff you you are friends of Ola and Chef Daniel, you’ll get a complimentary glass of champagne. I think the offer is only for the period when Ola is undergoing renovations."
Singapore's best kept secret,"Nestled within a beautiful mixed development condominium and office complex, it's arguably Singapore's best kept secret. Japanese owned, food comes from a place in New Zealand called Wakanui. The lamb they serve is divine and definitely the best available in Singapore. Be sure to have the lamb appetizer (you won't regret it). Steaks are amazing and way better than Cut by Wolfgang Puck. Good thing is that it is not ridiculously crowded on weekdays so you can have a decent conversation with excellent food. Corkage is expensive at S$60/bottle so just order from the menu."
Father’s Day Dinner,"Located on the 4th floor of the new Marina One. Had the Father’s Day special set, The Gentleman’s Cut, which was excellent. Famous for their Ocean grain fed beef from New Zealand. We were told that the cattle farm is near the Pacific Ocean. Also great was their lamb chops. We had it as a starter. Yes, they serve lamb chop as starters! Must try, marinated beautifully. Don’t miss their red snapper carpaccio. All in all a great place for a special event."
Special,What a wonderful experience. Steaks perfect Salomon divine Wine wonderful Ambience very nice Service perfect Not self satisfied or pretentious. A real gem Overall the best meal we can remember having here in Singapore in a very Long time
First visit to Wakanui,"Absolutely love the tender juicy spring lamb chop, one of the best lamb chop I tried in Singapore. The not too sweet Apple crumble with salt ice cream is a delight and great ending to our dinner. Kudo to the attentive service crews, keep up the good work!"
Improving,"Wakanui specialises in New Zealand produce with Japanese flavours.

I’ve now eaten at Wakanui three times now and I would say they are improving. The first time in December was not great - service was very slow and they were getting used to the kitchen etc. However I ate for both dinner and lunch in the last week and things are getting better.

On the plus side the service is getting better although could be sharpened a bit further. Also the food is generally good - I find the steak is excellent and better than the lamb (which is their speciality). The decor is OK - nothing special but also not over the top.

On the minus the lunch options are expensive compared to other options in town. The set menu is S$49 plus plus for multiple courses but the key main course choice is a burger. To get good lamb or steak means you need to pay quite a bit more. For many people this is too much for a corporate lunch - there are better value set lunch options in the Telok Ayer Street area.

Overall a good option in Marina One although I suggest that they need to watch their price points as there are good restaurant choices elsewhere in Marina One which are cheaper."
this restaurant is not ready to operate,"Was happy to learn about the new Marina One, so suggested to my colleagues to try this restaurant out.

The six of us ordered the grill selection and the seafood trio to share, and our own starters.
1. We were expecting a meat feast. Meat was OK, but with surprisingly tiny portion.
2. Seafood was consistently tiny, and not fresh.
3. My Hassun starter had a nice setting, but the actual food was embarrassing.
4. The potato wedges in truffle oil has zero taste of truffle.
5. For dessert, I ordered apple crumble. What I had was really apple pie.
6. For a place known for its steaks, they serve fine salt...

It is certainly pricy, so you would at least justify that with good service...
7. The Caucasian waiter poured water for me. Water spilled out. And he did not bother to wipe it.
8. After one of us tried the wine, the Asian waiter filled half of his huge wine glass, did the same for another male colleague, we were watching and jaw dropped (we only ordered one bottle). He was soon reminded by his superior and started to be cautious with the amount he poured. He took for granted that I am a female and I probably don't drink, and poured the amount that just covered the lower tip of my glass. Even after I pointed it out, he did not find anything wrong, and there was no apology from any of them. I was not even complaining about the order yet...The last of us only got probably one twentieth of the first two guys' amount.
9. My colleague sent back an empty plate, asking for one without water stain. They came back with one having exactly the same problem.

Well, at least the toilet is clean up to standard, always cheers me up..."
Loved It !!!,"We were there to celebrate my husband’s birthday and the experience was very pleasant.
The salmon thing was so delicious.
Very nice staff, affordable good food and we really appreciated the private salon.
I recommend the place if you want to have a nice dinner with family and friends.
2 things to improve :
- hard to find the restaurant
- Closing time is too early"
Dinner to check out this outlet,"Was a planned dinner to check this outlet & we were not disappointed. The service was good and food standard great. Meat dishes like our beef & lamb were great. Though our salads and side orders were good too but the servings were small.
But overall a nice place to go for a nice meal and I'll be back to try out other items on their menu."
Great food,Great atmosphere. Not cheap but not over the top. Excellent standard cuisine and efficient friendly service.
superb,"An absolute gem. Immaculate service. Perfectly cooked and presented food - just like the pictures! You are not going to stumble across this restaurant you will have to book and look, but you will not be disappointed."
New location,"Not sure if the maori name means the cuisine is from new zealand. Friend brought me here as apparently this place is bought by his friend. Housed in the ""in"" place for company offices now, 1 marina. It used to be in boat quay

The location is hidden on the 4th of an office tower so not great. Indeed, it was rather empty during our lunch

I had a burger for $25 and it was ok. My friend had wagyu , actually about 5 tiny cubes, for $50. That was not ok

My bet is this place won't last long. Poor location and overpriced"
"Good food, affordable fine dining","Firstly, the location of the restaurant is not that easy to find - West tower of the new building in Singapore. The receptionist seems to be quite new to the industry and was a little blur. Itoh san provided great service to us and brought the chef to every table to hear reviews about the food at the end of the dinner. Food was great. Best dish of the day was the hot smoked salmon! Really soft, fresh and juicy. Our medium rare steaks were well cooked. Oh the $8++ lamb chop was so tasty! Spent $771 for 3 people, including 2 bottles of red wine. Not a bad deal."
"Excellent meat, excellent location","A truly great meal on Boat Quay. Treated ourselves after a long, busy week in Singapore. Excellent location. You can sit inside with aircon but we sat on quayside watching the world go by. We chose steaks and various sides. All cooked as ordered and perfectly presented. Meat melted in the mouth and all were very happy with choice of restaurant. We drank Japanese beers with the meal but there is a reasonable wine list if required. My first time at this restaurant but certainly not my last. Highly recommended."
Great meat dishes but very poor fish dish,"Went to the restaurant for dinner with a party of 30 people and we used the whole 2nd level dinning hall. The air conditioners did not provide a cool environment for a comfortable dinner. Most of us were fanning ourselves.

The beef and lamb dishes were excellent. The other main course was Atlantic cod. The cod was overcooked and dry. Most of us who picked the fish dish took as bite and left the rest behind. Very disappointed with the fish.

Perhaps Wakanui should focus on the meat dishes and if want to provide a fish dish , please train the staff to cook it well."
