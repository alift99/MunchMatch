One of the best hidden gems in Singapore üëåüèª,This place is a hidden gem in Singapore! The food was delicious and the atmosphere was amazingüëåüèªüëåüèª The staff are very friendly and you can expect good service!
"Hidden, but nice cafe","I often go to this cafe with a group of buddies. The cafe is located along the street where is about 10 mins walk from MRT.
Despite this location, the place is quite busy.
They have Japanese inspired menu along with typical cafe menu.
I tried some snacks and these were good.
Coffee is not the best, but they have some selections of tea.

Overall it is nice hang out place."
pretty gem at king george,"super attentive staff, reasonable prices, chill and class atmostphere. food portion is big and delicious. had to of the dons and enjoyed both. overall i had a fun time hanging out there. will definitely return"
Good food... Nice service,"It was a lovely lunch and service was good. Well-balanced and tasty. We had the Unagi Don, Duck, Orion ring."
Nice Japanese Fusion Food,"The restaurant serve fusion Japanese food. The refinery truffle gyudon is awesome, and the coffee baller is also interesting. It‚Äôs quite crowded during lunch hour though. The price isn‚Äôt that cheap in that area, but the quality of food is really worth it."
Nice food and ambience,Everywhere else seems to be full house and we came across Refinery and decided to give it a try since there is still seats available. The place is nicely decorated and good for some Instagram pictures. We order the rice bowl and have a decent meal here. Service is good and the price is reasonable. Food is tasty as well. We didn‚Äôt spend too long in the restaurant as we just want a quick meal.
Thier mentaiko sauce is good! And the donburis bowl,"Not alot of range but food was good, love thier mentaiko fries! Located near lavender mrt, spacious tall ceilings"
Wine after work,"Visited here in Jan for a few glasses of wine after work with a friend. Good ambience and reasonable pricing with fairly efficient service. Didn't try the food, but it looked good."
Valentine's dinner date,"The food was good and served fast. It was obvious the place was under-staffed but they staffs were patience and attentive and tried their best. The place has nice decor but is a little warm. My partner and I enjoyed ourselves.
and... I like the happy hour. I mean, who doesn't?"
Change in menu but the food still good,"Overall ambience is good.
We wanted to try the Yakitori but sadly it was taken off the menu and we had no choice but to order other food in their new menu.

Food came pretty quick, maybe there isn't much crowd.

Staff were friendly and accommodating too!

We have some food and beer as well. Will return when they have Yakitori back in their menu."
A Rare Find,This place a rare find. It is located in an old industrial building. The food was fusion Japanese. The bar drinks menu was imaginative and good. Great place to meet friends and enjoy the evening.
Har Cheong Gai Burger,"Really crispy and good har cheong gai burger. The butter made the burger really flavourful and the Refinery waffle was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Nice ambiance and overall good food, only A LITTLE pricey."
Cosy place for chill,A cosy place for food and drink. Food are nice and staffs are friendly. Will not hesitate to go back again
"Nice ambience, good food!","Love the ambience of the place. The caf√© is spacious with outdoor seating as well, and the food we ordered (Har Cheong Kai Burger and another set of waffles) tasted so good we finished them all. Not to mention that the staff were friendly and attentive. Food was served relatively quick as well."
Nice restaurant but a bit overpriced,The lunch is good here. Nice environment. But the price is a little bit expensive. The coffee ice ball and the donburi are both very good
Average cafe in warehouse area,Food is average. We ordered the salmon & gyu don & Presentation was in a small bowl like food court style. The fried tofu thing was nice but not worth the price tag. Ambience was ok but service so so.. they put a single person at a 4 seater window seat and us 2 people need to occupy a small corner table. Service is impt to me when I dine out & I dont think they bother.. will not be back.
Nice Ambience with ok food,"Here for lunch for the first time but we were given a Brunch menu at 12ish own a weekend.... 3 of us ordered 3 mains, 2 sides and 5 beverages, it costed us almost $140.
I'm a fan of lobster and I will try a lobster dish whenever available, the refinery roll (lobster roll) in my opinion was the most disappointing dish of all those ordered as I find the fishy smell too strong.
Here's my ranking of the dishes ordered, 1 being the best: 1. Chicken Nanban 2. Wagyu with Foie Gras bowl 3. Truffle Fries with seaweed (only a little bit of truffle taste) 4. Risotto (rice abit hard) 5. Refinery Roll
Probably because we ordered the more expensive mains on the menu, else it should be much cheaper...
Nothing is stopping me from visiting again but no pull factor too!"
Relax n Chill,Laid back atmosphere and great food! Delicious fusion and value for money! Love their cauliflower dish.
Refinery,The food was prompt and service was fast. I think i will definitely go back to the place again =) The aircon could be much better though.
Tasty food but lack in service and portions,2nd visit to the refinery and I was disappointed that all food portions have reduced in size for the same prize. The restaurant was not even full on a Saturday yet service was slow to respond. 2 out of 4 of their dessert options were not available for a Saturday dinner. Food was tasty and interesting but probably will be my last time there
Yummy Food & Good Atmosphere,"I have visited this place for a couple of times already, both lunch & dinner time. it is one of my favourite place to be away from the crowds. And I have been booking them through chope and my very last recent visit, I was really surprised that the manager/owner read my remark on my booking's comment and then I have received a pleasant surprise from them due to it. Really appreciate it.

Food wise - The quality of the food has been consistent for me. Even friends who are fussy about their food, enjoy the food here (*thankfully). The portion may look small at first, but it is surprisingly filling. Price is affordable.

Oh yes, their Refinery Waffles is good :)

Drinks - Their Signature Coffee Balls is good, you can add a shot of Whisky to go with it. Have tried both with or without whisky, they are good on their own, it's more towards which type is your preference.

Their cocktails are surprisingly in good ratio and is delicious. This is not commonly found in many places.

Service - sometime it is a little disappointing, it should be consistent right? but we are all humans, however it would be great with more smile right?

Atmosphere - is good, though it might be quite warm during the day but its a nice place to hang out."
Great for after work drinks,"If you‚Äôre looking for that new trendy bar on your way home after work, Rookery could be the place for you. That is if you do actually have to pass it on your way home from work. If you don‚Äôt, you can check it out anyway as the beers are good value at around ten bucks a pint and they have Asahi Black, which is a bonus for me. The atmosphere is also relaxed and the venue has a large ceiling so it doesn‚Äôt feel claustrophobic. The food was a surprisingly good treat as we honestly just came for the drinks. The karage chicken was crispy and the chicken juicy, so it hit the spot. The Yakitori sticks were the highlight though, as the meat balls were thick and chunky and packed with flavour and the pork was as crispy as I like it. The egg plant with a sweet sauce was a little too sweet for my liking after a while, but it was still good. The fires were as good as you expect fried to be, so no complaints there. All in all, it was a good night out in a nice venue with even nicer food, so what more could you possibly want on your way home from work?"
The Refinery,"Very bad customer service. Place was not crowded when I went, but was given high table and chair. When I ask if possible to take the normal seat, the service staff says it is reserved. But I observed no reservation sign and the seat was vacant for the 2 hours I was there and was given to a walk in customer after that. In addition when I requested for the bill, the service staff acknowledged my request but bill never came after 10 mins. I have to go to counter to make payment. Definitely not going back no matter how good the food. In any case, food was ok, nothing to rave about."
"Sides fared better than mains in general, strict voucher T&Cs","Sides (chicken kaarage, truffle fries, onion rings) were pretty good. Mains-wise, only 1 (Gyudon) out of 3 was a hit. The lobster roll was super disappointing. For $25++, I had already expected the portions to be relatively small so that's fine. It did not taste good - dry and crumbly bread roll, too-cold lobster, coated in a lacklustre sauce. Since we ordered quite a few sides, 3 of my friends planned to share a main (mushroom risotto). I had a mouthful and immediately understood why they couldn't finish the one dish among the 3 of them - it was more like porridge than risotto, and was pretty bland. It was a good thing I had used a Chope voucher. Still, I did not think the quality of the food was worth the amount we ended up paying.

Word of caution - they are pretty strict with their Chope voucher T&Cs. Definitely read through voucher T&Cs carefully before even making a reservation, if you intend to purchase a voucher."
"great food, deco and service",calm and relaxing ambience. 10 min walk from mrt station. beef bowl is nice. octopus in the chirashi bowl is nice. portions not very big.
Interesting concept with a raw service,"The Refinery is located in a fun and relaxing ambience, re-modelled from an old industrial space. The range of modern Japanese set lunch is decent, for vegetarians (not for vegans) and non-vegetarians. The iced ball coffee served with hot milk in a sake flask is an unusual concept, including watching the service melts under lack of experience and untrained haphazardness. Will come back again but maybe with a lowered expectation."
"Cool ambiance, good food","I really liked the atmosphere of The Refinery. It had a nice vibe and open setup. The food and drinks were also quite good. High ceilings, hip decorations."
Average,brunch menu was average. More misses than hits. Will not go all the way there just for brunch. Environement was average. Probably better at night
Cool chill cafe vibe and fun delish food,"Good service. Good food. Pretty cafe. Chill vibes. Easy parking at night. Sadly, wagyu don, salted egg onion rings were not available when we were there ;("
Dinner,"Not much choice if u don‚Äôt want to have rice for dinner. Not cool enough so after walking to the cafe, still perspiring after half 20 mins (even it was drizzling outside). Food: truffle fries. Yakitori and waffles üëç"
Great ambience but food was so-so,"Nice ambience and great selection of drinks. The rice bowls were average, although the waffles were good. Service was pretty decent."
Take it or leave it Service,"Expensive, especially the (fairly uninteresting) Japanese beer - although there is a happy hour 2 for 1 if you‚Äôre there before 8pm. The food was ok though it‚Äôs a small menu, with its biggest section the sharing plates. Service was up and down, and I didn‚Äôt feel especially welcome, even though the place was half empty. They took my credit card and charged it via contactless without me being present, which is not great from a security point of view. Think I‚Äôll try other places in future."
satay,take the satay above all else. good decent food.. service was alittttttle slow but acceptable.. the other thing to note..the top up set meal is not worth it..the size of the dessert is not just tiny ..it is puny
Pretty chill place,"Dropped by this restaurant for lunch on a Friday. It was recommended by a friend who works around the area. It‚Äôs 5 mins walk from lavender mrt station and iseasy to locate. Amidst the old shop houses, this place is quite chill. Although the service was a bit slow probably due to the lunch crowd. Food wise, we tried the salted egg onion rings which are rather yummy but pricey. The chicken nuggets are just so so. The wagyu beef rice bowl was delicious and worth the $24. Portion wise good for small eaters. Overall, not too bad."
Truffling good time!,"Nice cosy and quiet place for dinner. Had their signature Refinery Gyudon and it was absolutely perfect and tasty, especially with the truffle mushrooms! The skewer platter was mouth savouring and the coffee baller was the perfect finishing touch for a wonderful dinner!"
Fun place!,Went for brunch and loved the atmosphere of the place! Everything about it was just right and the food was good and well priced.
Lunch experience,"My first visit to the restaurant was to celebrate mother's day with family. My eldest had insisted that we have brunch at The Refinery. I was pleasantly surprised at that time. The restaurant had high ceiling and setting was simple. Food was tasty and portion was right. That was 2 years ago and i have to say that i was a bit disappointed with the food and service. My spicy mee was too salty.It could be that there was insufficient staff, the service staff does not smile."
Excellent Venue with Great Food!,"I contacted The Refinery just a few weeks before my boyfriend's birthday, hoping to secure a venue to hold a surprise for him. Kiat and his team reached out to me, and was extremely responsive and helpful throughout. They provided useful recommendations that made the entire planning process a breeze for me. Everything went smoothly on the day of the surprise. Guests thoroughly enjoyed the food, and their on site staff did an amazing job overseeing the entire event. Highly recommended! Thank you so much once again, Kiat and team!"
"If you are in the area, this is a good place","Nothing special about this place but it‚Äôs easy and causal. We had the cauliflower tempura and also the deep fry morning glory. They were both good and tasty.

We also had 5 yakatori and the signature ones were good. If you want a quick bite, this is a rather good spot."
Overrated,"Today brought a colleague for her birthday lunch after searching for nice place at Lavender area. Nice environment indeed however the main dishes classified under Signature Bowls were over rated. I ordered Popular Refinery Gyudon and Recommended Spicy Mee and they were too salty to consume. Unfortunately we could not finish after paying about $35 for those 2 main dish.
Maybe we have a different chef today otherwise definitely overrated and overpriced !!!"
Nice place for date night,"My husband and i had the Beef rice bowl and the teriyaki rice bowl, some yakitori and the refinery waffles. They were all great! except that the waitress forgot to instruct the cook to leave out something i had specifically mentioned to exclude. Could have been because they don't take orders down and memorise them by heart."
Great for late night snacks!,"Chance upon this on the map late at night and so here we are to check the place out.

At 11.30pm, they only have bar snacks to serve, and the tori karaage was crispy and yummy to fill out little stomachs.

Their coffee was creative. Served as espresso ice ball with warm milk. Put the warm milk over the ice ball to get your glass of cold coffee. But that was really all to it, the coffee isn‚Äôt something I would shout about."
"Friendly staff, food is great but quantity of mains is a little small","Friendly staff, food is great but quantity of mains is a little small. Ambience is great as well, would recommend for group gatherings."
Female customer who finds the main course portion small,Smallest Donburi I have gotten so far for a price about a regular bowl of donburi in Japan. Refinery does fusion but it should improve with its lapsing service and food portion. The daily special's choco cake is highly recommended.
Family dinner at Refinery,"This is my 2nd visit to Refinery 115. First visit was with my friends during brunch time and now dinner with my family. I liked the ambience of the cafe .. a nice place to relaxe and enjoy our meal. However since it‚Äôs a food establishment I cannot give it a high rating for the food served which i feel is average or below. Various type of donburi is served as the mains for dinner. However, nothing special and imbalance portion between the meat/fish and rice. Too much meat/fish with a small portion of rice makes the bowl too salty. Mushroom yakitori - oily and bland. If a cafe served a short menu we expected better execution but it‚Äôs a disappointment. Ice cream that comes with the set dinner .. hmm.. can give a miss. Overall if you want better food there are better options out there. But if u want a place to relax, it a good place to go."
Quiet Find,"Easily assessible via public transport (bus/train). Ample parking around the cafe.. no free parking on Sundays/Public Holidays. There are empty private lots in front of the cafe though. Might be worth asking the staff if you can park your vehicle in the lots whilst dining at the cafe. The cafe has a very open, well-spaced concept. Nice place to chill with friends. Food service is fast. The menu is rather lacking in the desserts department though."
Great place to chill & meetup with friends,"Met up at The Refinery to have a birthday dinner gathering for our friend. The food was great, staff were fast & efficient. Waiting time for food was good, didn't have too much of a wait. Wine was good, lovely atmosphere & unique decorations. Will definitely visit again, would love to try out the brunch & lunch menu! Thank you so much!"
Small quantity,"Been there for lunch a few times. The food served was alright. Not fantastic but decent. The first thing that came into my mind is the quantity/size of the food served. The portion is seriously...small. And the price is the opposite. I am sure they can improve on this.

Food preparation speed is impressively fast though. Which got me thinking the Unagi (eel) i had must be from frozen packed instead of being freshly grilled.

It is always packed during lunch hours and open from 12noon onwards."
Alright,"I was wavering between a 3 and 4 star experience and finally decided on a 3. The space itself is straight out of a hipster's playbook-on the ground floor of an industrial building and saturated with all the elements you would expect from a millennial hangout. Hanging industrial hooks, exposed wires, black frames, you name it. Menu is basic, just grain bowls and yakitori with drinks and desserts. I had the chicken teriyaki grain bowl which was good, but not better than any other you would find in the city. Also, it was rather basic and there were no layered textures that gave an element of surprise. Same goes for the seasoning- good, but no added accents. I was attended to by a server who was not rude, but extremely cold and stone faced. Average food, cold service- even good decor can't save this."
Lovely place to unwind and enjoy good food,The place is done up nicely with high ceilings. The food has been thoughtfully created and tastes delicious. The portions for the mains are generous.
Just to snack,"We had only the seaweed truffle fries and the salted egg onion rings, verdict is not fantastic as review."
Oasis in the middle of Bendemeer,"Had agedashi tofu and curry noodles. Tofu was crispy outside, remained crispy while savouring. sauce was just right, not too sour or salty. curry noodles was spicy, not for anyone who like mild spicy. prepared as dry noodle, minced chicken was lean, not soggy and onsen egg done just right. highly recommended for the ambience and the food. Good for dating, intimate close friends gathering, or after dinner drinks chill chat place."
Nice izakaya place,"good experience overall, food was good, feels like it was worth the money. yakitori portions could be a big bigger though, but it was nice food, so still worth it. Loved the cauliflower fritto and tempura party, quality deep fried food."
Understaffed!!,"The Yakitori though a limited spread but was tasty and well cooked! Nice ambience and cosy for a chill night out. However the other dishes seemed overpriced. The Wagyu beef doesn‚Äôt taste as good and only served 3 slices for a portion. The food took a while to serve as they explained the lynare understaffed for the night. Despite that they‚Äôre not in full capacity. Guess that‚Äôs the usual staff constraint in the Singapore F&B. Overall it was still pleasant, won‚Äôt mind dropping by to taste other dishes"
Great light food and drinks,"Found this though our hotel. Great space. Huge space with high ceilings, but still felt very cozy. We were the only guest at first and still felt comfortable. The rice bowls are small but very tasty and the skewers we tried were great! I wanted to go back later the same night, but didn't have time. Would recommend for sure!1"
Good food!,"The Refinery Gyudon was super good! Though the food was a bit pricey, but the food quality was really worth the money paid! I think the atmosphere isn't really that fantastic, but the servers were very friendly and helpful, which made the overall experience perfect! Will definitely come back for the food."
Brunch at The Refinery,"6 pax. Nice ambience and attentive service. Food was good enough for me. I can't speak for the rest. Slightly warm environment (maybe we were early, and the air-con took a while to cool the place with rather high ceiling)."
Peaceful environment and good quality food,"came here last week, the place is quiet and nice. service and food are decent too. would be back again in the future."
Bad experience,A table of 10 pax's dinner order was forgotten and not processed until my colleague checked with them 2 hours later (whole group was having their happy hour drinks while waiting for food). Although discount was provided but apologies and followup was not sincere.
My favorite brunch place in Singapore!,"I enjoy weekend mornings in The Refinery and it is always a treat to spend a quiet morning with their Epic Gyudon bowl. The combination of mushrooms, sous vide egg and foie gras is something I look forward to, and there is something unique but not pretentious about each of their dishes. The modern, industrial vibe and the lovely staff round out the dining experience."
Friday Lunch,"Friday ladies lunch.... it‚Äôs located short walk from Lavendar mrt and surrounded by industrial shop house. The food is a bit pricing but delicious. Gyudon is recommended if you are a beef person, and don‚Äôt forget to order the coffee ballers. Slowly pour hot milk on it and drink. Don‚Äôt pour it at once as the ice ball will melt and coffee will dilute, it won‚Äôt taste nice."
Above and beyond,"We were sent here by our friend Bhuan and not only is this place right up our street wit the design and amazing beers on tap but the owners, their friends and family could not have made us feel more welcome and looked after us better if they tried.

It was lovely getting to know them all and they gave us lots of insight into the area and a directory of things to go and see!

Thanks to everyone at the refinery for a great afternoon."
Food is pretty decent,The signature dishes of Refinery Don is really good. Most of the dishes though is pretty standard stuff that can be found in other Japanese restaurants. The taste though is better. Eggs benedict were quite poor though. The eggs were a little overcooked. Menu options can be more or more creative. The service is quite average and the location is not so good as parking can be a problem. The coffee ballers is a little unique. Good to just chat in the evening also.
Unacceptable Behaviour,Dined at the place last evening. Great food but was surprised at the behavior of a service staff. He outright threw a bowl and a glass on the floor in full view of all patrons apparently because he was in a bad mood. Everyone was shocked. Can't imagine what happen if a customer offended him. Unsure why the manager can tolerate such behavior and pampered him like a child.
Average,"Went for sunday brunch as it was near our final destination. First impressions were good, quite a few people, good atmosphere, nice music and not too loud. Brunch menu was ok, i went for the eggs benedict while my friend had the double confirm shiok burger, we also ordered some wings on the side. For the eggs benedict i wasnt impressed, badly poached eggs let the whole dish down, and presentation failed too. The burger my friend said was too salty, and the wings were ok but sour and the skin under the thick coating of batter was like jelly. For me this was just average food, and the atmosphere had me expecting more. Not a place i would trouble myself to visit again, sorry, but feel free to try it for yourself."
Great place for weekend hangout,"Great and attentive service, food portion is quite filling so it's good for sharing for people with not-so-big appetite. Great place to hang out on a lazy Saturday."
"Delicious food, nice cafe","Portion of the food is not big, good for sharing still for 2 pax. Must try will be their donburi, I must say they have one of the best. We order quite a bit for sharing as we have 4 pax. Foie gras a must try too."
Playlist that fits the food,"Great food, paired with really intuitive, friendly service and an amazingly curated music playlist makes for one lovely dining experience!"
Cool and chill,"What a find! The place is cool and chill. Nice for friends to catch up for a chin-wag for sure.

We came for dinner. As we didn‚Äôt fancy any of the Don, so our selection got somewhat limited. We had the fried cauliflowers which were delicious and the portion was generous. The tempura platter was also great. Miso aubergine was tasty and so were the chicken meatballs.

The only thing I wish to have was more options on non fry veggie. Otherwise it was a nice and light dinner."
Had a Good Lunch,"Luckily we were there 3 minutes before the restaurant opens for business. We didn‚Äôt have a reservation, but was lucky to get a table indoor for two. The place was filled up fast during lunch time.

I had the salted egg onion rings and spicy mee, they were delicious but I couldn‚Äôt finish the onion rings despite sharing it with my husband because the portion of the mains was pretty generous. My spicy mee was covered with spicy minced meat. The noodles were springy and just the right level of sauciness.

Parking the car was a little troublesome because the parking lots around the restaurant are limited. Do come early to avoid the horde of lunch crowd."
Delicious food,Love the ambience of the restaurant. Their yakitori was nice and grilled to almost perfection. The appetizer was good as well. Will go back again for more!
"Coffee is good, slightly pricey for mains",Ordered mocha which is thick and nice. The chicken burger on the other hand is good but the price is slightly high.
"Friendly service, moderate pricing.","Food is delicious and ambience is fine... Great place to chill out. Outside CBD zone, public parking available nearby. 6-8pm happy hours for beer lovers."
Chill night,Nice place to get together with a bunch of friends. The food is tasty and the service is superb. I will definitely come back here again!
"Decent food, great ambience","Food was decent, above average.
Service was efficient and time taken to prepare was acceptable. The indian waitress was very courteous and attentive, always having a smile on. She deserve a commend:).

I booked for 7 persons but somehow we had 11 person that showed up so we called for a extra seats and just happened to have extra seats as previous guest was about to leave. The restaurant was generous to allocate 4 more seats for us.

But we left slightly disppointed because while we were enjoying our meal half way, one of the staff came over and told us that they impose a minimum spending of 25++ for 9 persons and above. Not that we are a cheapskate bunch, but i think the restaurant should take a look at our orders before telling us. Each of us had a main course and we ordered double side dishes for the long table. The bill came up to about 25 dollars short of the total minimum spending. We didn't want to make it look ugly and just ordered 2 desserts just to close the tab. I mean come on, minmum spending ? Really ? Not like we are seating there for 3-5 hrs just hogging on to one drink each. I believe the restaurant doesn't implement this for groups of more than 9 people who is just drinking away on happy hours right? U will only drive ur customers away. Or maybe u do?

Management should reconsider their policy and look into the double standards if there is.
But still, Thank you for hosting us."
Food did not meet expectations,"Went to try their lunch menu after reading very good reviews. Teriyaki chicken don was below expectations, rice was quite hard and not the soft japanese rice as stated in the menu description. Coffee was not bad, The waffle was not as good as before. Service was quite prompt but then the cafe was not crowded."
Wonderful place to chill,"Love the atmosphere, service and food. Ambience was awesome!! Love the drinks too. Will definitely go back for the bar food!"
Dinnertime menu,"Perhaps I came at the wrong time of the day, the restaurant looked very dark and dull at night. Portions were small and very pricey."
Quaint feel :) food was tasty,Enjoyed my visit there . The food was good and the staff was really friendly. She advised on the food options. Loved the coffee baller
Brilliant Service & Food,Always love coming back to refinery for their berry waffles. Spot on. :) the staff are so friendly and they ensure you‚Äôre well taken care of during your dining experience.
Great experience,"The Refinery is one of Singapore's most original eateries. Eclectic menu with fusion Japanese bowls and bites that make for great grazing. Complemented by a good Sak√© and Japanese whisky list, with Asahi dry and black on tap; together with a great high ceiling dining room that is rustic and very creative. What more can you ask?"
Noisy,"Due to the design of the restaurant, the sound keep bouncing off the walls and so it‚Äôs really a noisy place for lunch. Kale chips are oily and horrible tasting and should be removed from the menu."
Nice place for group lunch,Food was good and group/ baby friendly. Menu was extensive so we had good variety. Service pretty fast too.
Great fusion food,"2nd time here. Had the teriyaki chicken bowl, kalechips and kiss of love yakitori. Food and service were great. Felt relaxed being here on a weekday night away from the bustle of town."
Consistent standard üëç,"This was my 2nd visit & i was glad with the consistency in both your food & service level. I've brought my friends there this time & they were happy overall too. The only setback is one of your staff took my mobile phone to the back of your counter to record the chope voucher number in your system during settling of bills but forgotten to return it to me. When I left & went back shortly after to look for my phone, it was just lying around on the cashier counter 'unattended' meaning anybody could have just taken it"
Have now tried nearly all the menu!,"Having been directed here on recommendation from our hotel - we turned up late and the place was very quiet, so we were was not sure if this was a good sign. As it turned out, people tend to eat fairly early and so we were eating after most people had finished. Not really knowing our way round the Asian fusion menu, we ended up ordering a mix of dishes to share and boy where they good.

So much so we returned the following night to try the other half of the dishes that we had not tried the first night - these were just as good. The beef wrapped foir gras skewers were melt in the mouth goodness, as was the pork belly lollie pops."
Nice food but very small portions with big price,My husband and I both had the mushroom risotto. It tasted lovely and had a very rich buttery mushroom flavor. The cafe itself looked very trendy and the staff were quite polite. Unfortunately the mushroom risotto was very small for the $18 price tag. I could have eaten about 3 and had to go and eat some more food elsewhere. I hope in future you are able to increase the portion size especially as risotto is not too difficult to cook in bulk in an industrial kitchen. Thank you.
Good Experience at The Refinery,My family and I had brunch at The Refinery to celebrate my sister's birthday. We had a good time there. I look forward to my next visit there.
Great afforable rice bowls!,The place to go for afforable and extremely good rice bowls! The atmosphere is great for gatherings too; thumbs up!
Quick lunch,I had teriyaki donburi for lunch. The food and service were good. About 2 blocks away from lavender mrt.
Refine the refinery,"Refine the refinery. Love the coffee baller, its a winner! The food was average and the shiok burger in all honesty wasn‚Äôt shiok. The salted egg yolk sauce was bland and not thick enough. The chicken patty lost out to mc spicy chicken and if I am paying more the mcdonalds, I expect it to be better. Truffle fries are better than average as the flavour comes through. Service was understaff and just average really. Overall a good place to come for the decor, drinks and food."
Good place to chill,"Went here for a light dinner and drinking ! Enjoyed the environment and of course their daily happy hour! We ordered some finger food like salted egg onion rings and kale chips to share. Kale chips were quite oily..Food was okay, and staff were nice. But it was quite warm that day, not sure if they turned on all the air conds The price was decent ! And I wish they could have more choices in the dessert menu as they only have waffles. Overall experience was great! Will definitely return again!"
Sunday Lunch,"1st time at Refinery! Their GYUDON did not disappoint! The Salted Ehg Onion Rings is also yummy! (a must order) their praline mocha was also good! But don‚Äôt order th waffles as it was a miss! Overall, love the ambience of the restaurant :) Will definitely come back :D"
Average Good,"Was quite sad that we were unable to try the yakitori platter that day, but about an hour plus into the meal I saw a table behind us being able to order yakitori despite them saying that their grill was down. Sad, but otherwise, just about everything else is fine, except maybe the kyoto mousse is a little too much in feeling 'gelat'."
refinery,"food was so so. service was also so so. we were supposed to celebrate a friend's birthday. The staff instead of bringing out the cake with candle lit, they just passed us the whole cake with the box. It was just awkward."
Great food & Service,If you like salted eggs... this is the place to go. We shared the salted eggs onion rings and the shiok burger that had salted egg sauce on it too and it was great. I like the fact that it wasn't too crowded either. Loved the decor!
Flavour's what's important.,"I've been following their instagram for quite awhile and have been very keen on trying The Refinery out. Upon arrival, I was really drawn by the chic interior decorative of the restaurant. However, as much as this place is instagramable, the food didn't really match up. In terms of value, the lunch set was rather reasonable - the only let down was just the food. I had the pork don, it was rather disappointing. The cut of the meat (I'm assuming it's loin) lacked fats thus, without the right skills the meat eventually came out to be really dry. Flavour of the sauce was average too. For the sharing bites, I had the taste of the salted egg onion rings and truffle fries. Pretty average. The wasabi mayo that came with the truffle fries was really good though - had a great kick of wasabi. However, with the seaweed and wasabi I feel like the truffle essence didn't pull through? Could've just used without it and made it just 'japanese fries'. Lastly, salted egg onions. Great idea but could be better executed with a lighter batter.

So would it be worth a second trip? Urm, maybe. Just to try out their coffee though, I'd pass the food."
Decent sides but average mains,"The sides we ordered, cheese fries and onion rings were not bad but the mains touted to be the bestsellers was not quite up to expectations. The beef, though well seasoned, was over-cooked. The eel wasn't anything to shout about. The nicest dish was the chili noodles."
Improvement needed,"Celebrated my husband's birthday here with a group of friends. Despite mentioning earlier to the management, nothing was done. I do understand that not all places accommodate to these, but not even one staff said happy birthday to him. The food was nothing of wow factor, and at a pricer end. They even forgot one of our friend's order which was the gyu-don and we thought it would take a longer waiting time to prepare. Eventually, we found out that it was left out and my poor friend had to wait for an even longer time while the rest of us had finish our food some time ago."
Good atmosphere,A lot of desserts are not available. Good atmosphere and valuable drinks selection during happy hour
