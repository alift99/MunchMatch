Fine dining,The food and service is excellent! Highly recommended. The current lunch promotion of 5 dishes for S$25+ per adult and S$15+ is super and my kids love the food too! We have been back a number of times since!
Awesome Indian cuisine,"Went there on a sunny Saturday afternoon as I was craving for Indian cuisine. This is not my first time at Ras and I am amazed at how the food can be so consistent over the years (first visit was in 2015/2016). Service was exceptional as well and I definitely felt well served.

Ordered 3 dishes - was about $120 but it is definitely worthwhile for the food, ambience, and quality of service. Highly recommend for everyone to go."
Authentic Indian cuisine,"The place is located in the Heart of singapore i.e. Clarke Quay/Boat Quay. This is the Party Hub or the go to Night life where people of all ages gather for a Stroll and Enjoying. The Menu is a Good mix of VEG and NON-VEG. It also has drinks on the menu for those who wish to have .
Would reccomend But its heavy on your pocket would term it as expensive ."
Indian Deliciousness,"We have visited RAS ESSENCE OF INDIA on many of our trips to Singapore.
The food is delicious. Serves are generous. The staff are fabulous, ready to welcome you and have a chat.
The beer is cold and the mango lassi delicious. The view over the river at Clarke Quay provides a nice backdrop. The cool breeze over the river provides a welcome relief."
First rate,Stopped for an impromptu dinner last night at Ras. What a find! The food was top quality with excellent spicing and immaculate service. Nothing wS too much trouble. There is a wonderful vibe in the area with live music and a happy atmosphere . Clarke Quay is an must one a visit to Singapore and you must find the Ras restaurant if you appreciate highly skilled cooking from northern India.
Great food,"We come with my friend,
We get good food, and good service.
This is a great restaurant.
..........
Will come again next time !!!"
Authentic indian food,Very good authentic indian food. Readonably priced but that is not the highlight of the place..the highlight of the place is its authentic taste.
Superb food. Very good service. Worth a visit for everyone!,"Very good food, well cooked meat, great breads and a memorable experience on a riverfront in Singapore amidst over priced, more often than not, average resturants. Worth a visit and caters to the Indian and international palate."
Delicious Indian cuisine in Singapore.,"After three days in Singapore, and having tried Turkish and Singapore food, our craving for Indian food had climbed a few notches. That's when, by chance, we came across 'Ras, the Essence of India.' To begin with, the ambience of the neat and tidy restaurant by the riverside was great (we sat outdoors although there is provision to sit indoors too); the staff were courteous and served us with a smile. The preparations: Dal Makhani, Paneer and an assortment of breads (Pudina Paratha, Tandoori Roti and Butter Nan) tasted like any of the best restaurants in Delhi. We did not miss 'Home Food' at all. So delicious were the preparations that we reordered some breads and ate to our heart's content... nay, overate. Delicious indeed––the very thought of that dinner is mouth watering for us. Would strongly recommend to visitors to Singapore with a liking for Indian food. By choice we had ordered vegetarian food although non-vegetarian food was also available."
Friendly Waiter (Raj),The food was really good and so does the customer service. Special thanks to raj who took the order and taken good care throughout the dinner. Recommended.
Relaxing Indian by the river,"Visited on 29 December, friendly greeting, arranged a table by the water after waiting just a few minutes. Food was good, the usual choice of dishes with service to match. Recommend for both couples and families."
Racist attitude,Totally disappointing experience. Seems like restuarant doesn't want to serve brown skin people. Went there with family. staff says give me 2 mins I will get that (a specific) table ready. The manager decides to give the table to a white skin group totally ignoring the commitment to us. What food quality and service can when expect from a Racist Restaurant! Go at your own risk
Good Food And service Went,"Good Food And service
Went for dinner and the food was good. Enjoyed the view and fresh winds. Good for vegetarian as well"
Very nice dinner on Christmas Eve,"Very nice dinner on Christmas Eve with my wife. We booked in advance, table was ready on time and we were witted next to the river as I was asking for in the reservation. Waiter helped us very friendly with the order and gave some real good recommendations! Great service, great food, perfect evening! Thanks for all!"
Great option for tasty Indian,Great option for tasty Indian food with friendly staff and good happy hour cocktails. The spice is just right and the location is very pleasant on the river watching the world go by.
Delicious,"4 of us had dinner here, ordered naan, mutton, chicken, prawns and spinach with cheese, dont exactly remember the names of the dishes, but everything was delicious, also had a pint of beer! Highly recommended!"
Good location,"The location of the restaurant is really good, close to the water. The staff is really polite and the food is good. Enjoyed my time here and you can take a walk around Clarke Quay before/after the meal. Going to this place again during future travels."
Dinner,Good location on Clarke Quay. The food was terrible and very pricey. One naan was $7 Singapore dollars.....outrageous! Never again.
"Excellent food and staff, but not cheap","Excellent experience and well situated by the river, good selection, very fresh and ample drinks choice. Staff make the place and they couldn’t be more efficient. Yes it doesn’t come cheap, but you know this before you order."
"Good Food, good service...","The food that we ordered was really nice...Sizzling Tandoori Prawns were fresh & very tasty...Butter chicken was really tasty...the location is right by the river. The restaurant manager Ajeesh was really courteous & helpful.
Only downside is its quite expensive."
Holidays with family,Best place to sit and have a nice view of river. Very polite staff and of helping. Have a good test of Indian food when you are in Singapore.
"Great Indian Food, overlooking the river","It is fantastic ambiance at river valley road, and it is great Indian food. During my singapore visit, I was not very keen to try the Indian food, but my other friends dragged me, and I confess the food was very delicious. We had a great time, great meal. A must try, if you are looking for Indian Food."
POOR EXPERIENCE TONIGHT,"Poor. Was expecting so much more from this restaurant given the other reviews. Not a happy customer I’m afraid.

Would not recommend. Lots of other restaurants to try in the area."
Good food but very expensive,"We just had dinner at RAS. The dishes tasted good although the lamb korma tasted sweet and more like beef rather than lamb. However, the prices were ridiculously expensive. Sadly, we will not go return again."
Good food but very pricy,"We had samosas and tandoori chicken as starters. Both were ok but not outstanding.
Our main dishes were a butter chicken and a lamb curry - both were certainly outstanding !!!
The portions were pretty large. The restaurant is located bythe river and offers a very nice atmosphere. The staff was very friendly, fast and efficient.
Compared to other Indian restaurants we found the prices being high. At boat quay prices are cheaper."
Good Mojito bye 1 get one,The Mojito was good and the sitting area at the sea side is good. The white vine sangria? I can make it better. The fresh Tiger prawns(starter) with the Indian spice was really good.
Beautiful Restaurant with great food and service.,"We had dinner on 23/9/19. The restaurant was full however the staff made up a table for us and once a larger table became available they asked if we would like to move and we did. The atmosphere was lovely and we thoroughly enjoyed our food. The staff were attentive and helpful, especially our server Ajeesh.
The location is great and we will return for dinner again next time we are in Singapore."
General,We went restore the on 28th September 19 I loved the food very tasty with good hospitality good vegetarian food we feel like we are India
Fantastic Food and Great Service,"Went to the restaurant on my second trip to Singapore. Really loved the taste of the food. Kudos to the chef- The best Indian Food I tried so far.

When I talk about the ambience -Perfect location and best place to have your dinner!

Recommend to Dine in at the seats near to the Clarke River if you don't mind about aircon

And service- Exceptional. Faster and surely need appreciation.

Advice- It will be even better if have more lobster related food and cannot find daily specials."
Get it India,A great place and delicious food for a relaxing dinner. We ate there twice over our 3 day stay! And we ate the same things!
Authentic Indian Food by the riverside,"Situated by the riverside Clarke Quay, it offers authentic Indian cuisine.
The staff are friendly. The wait time for food is not long, thankfully.
The ambience is just right for a perfect dinner.
I tried the mixed meat platter (chicken/ prawn/ mutton/ fish). It was both tasty n filling for 2.
Special shout out to Mr. Ajeesh, who was friendly, chatty and took good care. Must visit if your are at Clarke Quay. Will go again."
"If you can discover, there are really good Indian restaurants in this area","I went to this place after reading the reviews, but to my surprise there are other Indian restaurants which are much better than this place. Food is average, service is good."
So tasty,We had a really lovely meal. After walking through Clarke quay and trying to find somewhere to eat we found this place. We all love curry and all agreed that it was one of the best curries we've had in a long time. I had the bhuna gosht which was so tasty and not too dry. My husband and 12yr old son had Chicken Chettinad which was spicy but you could really taste all of the flavours. Was quite expensive but happy to pay for something so good.
A cool place on Clarke Quay,Had Singapore Sling and light snacks after the River Cruise. Clarke Quay is lined with Restaurants and great place to spend time on the River. Ras is good with food and service was prompt and courteous
First night in Singapore....,"...fancied a curry! RAS in Clarke Quay was our choice and we were not disappointed! Food excellent, service excellent, would highly recommend this restaurant."
The RAS of Indian Taste,The Clark quay is a hang out zone which is mushroomed with Pubs and restaurants which serves cuisines from the world. In such places it becomes difficult to manage vegetarian food. Being an Indian We feel safe when we get some Indian Restaurant. I Found “The RAS” a restaurant at least 15 years old in this locality. both the vegetarians and non vegetarians foods are delicious here. The service were really fast . The Hindi speaking staffs are very prompt and helpful to select any dish.
"Wow, Indian food at its best",We liked the food so much that we ate here twice during our few days in Singapore. The food is fantastic - packed with flavour - the best Indian food I have ever had. And the service was excellent too (thank you Raj). Highly recommended.
Great and gluten free friendly,Great service by nice people. Told us clearly what was gluten free (about 4 curries) in perfect English. And the food was really nice.
Best Indian food in Singapore,"Ver good Indien food, freindly service and cold Tiger bear from Tab. Enjoy the view of the river in a friendly environment with excellent food. I enjoyed spicy Chicken Jalfreezy with safran rice..good spicy curry sauce with tender chicken and garlic nan bread...phantastic..enjoy it..please make a reservation for the evening because it´s always a very busy place"
"Authentic Indian food, great location","The Ras restaurant is located on Clarke Quay which is a very nice location, especially in the evening. It is very pleasant to sit by the water and enjoy very good Indian food.
The dishes were quite authentic, spicy and delicious. The service was pleasant. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to the Indian food lovers."
Family dinner of three,"Really bad quality food , very expensive and poor customer service . Wanted to occupy table and as soon as you seat wanted to finish it faster. Wasted 124 dollars for dinner of 2 adults a child."
Great food and location,"Fast and friendly service in the vibrant Clarke quay district.

A very varied menu featuring many favourites you would find at home and additionally some local specialities.

We had the prawn Biriyani and a Chicken Biriyani both served with a cooling dip we also shared a peshwari naan all really good size portions and extremely tasty.

Wine was very expensive as usual in Singapore but this was on offer at $65 oyster bay Sauvignon Blanc.

One to try..."
Amazing,"We had our 2nd visit to this amazing Indian. The food is delicious, staff are delightful and the venue is beautiful.

We had butter chicken and lamb rogan josh, naan bread and rice. It was so good.

We told the waiter it was our 2nd visit and he very pleased."
Waterfront delight,"For the last few years, I’ve tended to frequent Curry Culture on Cuppage for my Indian cuisine - it’s never let me down. On this occasion, I was staying at Clarke Quay and wanted to eat in close proximity to the hotel. Ras is on the waterfront, and you certainly pay for the privilege because the prices are higher than other good quality Indian restaurants in Singapore. However, the quality didn’t disappoint.

It’s worth noting the menu is extensive - plenty of choice and great variety. I started with the stereotypical British onion bhajia. An incredible sized portion which was light and a perfect per-cursor to my main meal, Masaladar Murgh, a beautiful chicken-based curry which I had with a keema naan and saffron jeera rice. It was sublime; difficult to beat in all respects.

It’s certainly at the higher end in terms of price with my bill a little over 100SGD, but I can’t deny it was worth it."
My thoughts entirely,"Without simply repeating previous reviews, my thoughts are exactly the same. You are paying premium prices to sit over looking the river and enjoying the city lights.
The food is very good and the service also, but it was expensive and the following day in the Little Indian district prices were a fraction of the cost.
And they don't have toilets. i had to walk for 5 minutes to find the nearest one...
A lovely restauarnt and enjoyable evening."
Good but expensive,"It’s easy to bleed money in Singapore, especially in restaurants, and here’s no different.

RAS serves good food with good service, and it’s very pleasant to sit by the river. But expect to pay big $$$. It cost us $300 for three of us, eating three curries, sides, rice, and the second cheapest wine on the menu."
Nice but expensive.,"You pay for the location and all the tourists.
The food is good, but you can get the same quality food for half the price a short walk away.
Food wise. Top!"
Best food ever,Indian food is one that all 5 of us agree on. We’ve had a lot of Indian food and this one is a total 10 out of 10. Rajeesh was our waiter and was amazing at recommending dishes. We ate so much we can barely move. My kids all had butter chicken because they don’t eat spicey. My daughter had the vondaloo which was very awesome. We could not recommend this place more.
A lovely authentic experience,"After a nice walk around Clarke Quay we came across this lovely restaurant on the waterfront. The staff, especially Raj, were very friendly and attentive, and assisted us in selecting some delicious courses. I recommend the cheese filled Naans, and the chicken biriyani, both of which arrived hot and quickly. Our simosas and chicken tikka entrees were also excellent.

The food is moderately spicy but delicious and authentic. Kingfisher beer was a new experience.

Highly recommended for those who love Indian cuisine."
Amazing Food,"Fabulous food.
just a reminder if they say the food will be spicy, they mean it. its not international level low spicy.
Food was fab and so was the service.
My parents only eat Indian food and getting Indian food at Clarke Quay was something I didnt imagine.
Must go place"
Just wow Indian.,"What ever we ordered was tasty and well cooked.

Authentic Indian cuisine. Roti, naan, kulcha, paneer kadai, veg Kolhapuri etc everything was good.

Nice location too."
Very nice food and service,"Loved our visit. Enjoyed a lovely Sunday evening on the banks of the Singapore river in Clarke Quay. The restaurant offers a good selection of beer, wine, cocktails, mocktails, along with a big selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food."
Dinner with family,"Great butter chicken, great dal makhani, great kebabs and great rotis / naans
Wish we could order more but this much was enough for 3 adults

I was quite happy with the service. The staff was super quick and efficient and the food was also served rather quickly.

We love this place and if you have mughlai food cravings, then this place should take care of yearnings :)

Highly recommend this place"
Excellent dinner,"Would definitely recommend restaurant for quality, quantity and service. Meals were very generous and the waiters were attentive."
Lunchtime meal,"Fabulous food, fresh ingredients and friendly service. Excellent location on the riverside. One of the best curry’s we have ever had !"
Best Butter Chicken Ever,"Right along the Singapore river at Clark Quay, nice outdoor spot. Service was excellent and the food was very good. Butter chicken really exceptional and the saffron rice and naan was very tasty. Strongly recommend!"
GOod but not amazing,The food was nice and the service very good but the cost extortionate for what is just a curry. I think you pay just for the venue which is lovely next to the river but I feel the costs aren’t warrented for this level of cuisine
Amazing experience and hospitality,"I went there with my wife and kid to recall our last year family trip, just at the entry I realized that I left my mobile in taxi. I talked to the person attending he assured me not to worry. He took pain and called taxi customer care and followed with them to finally get the phone.
The food taste was doubled due to this hospitality.
I visited the restaurant because we still remembered the food quality and tastefrom last years visit, authentic Indian. On top of that this years incident has only increased by liking for this restaurant.

Thankyou for your amazing food and hospitality."
Dress Circle Prices. You pay for the view,"Any venue in Clarke Quay attracts a ""tourist premium"" and this venue is no exception. Food no better than home (Australia) but around 20% to 30% higher due to location. By all means celebrate a special occasion, but not the kind of venue that would attract ""regulars""."
Not good for single diners,"Visited alone and the majority of dishes seem to be aimed at couples or 2 portions and are priced accordingly
The quality and taste is excellent however.
The staff were also friendly.
Please offer half portions so you can get variety whilst eating alone."
Very delicious Indian food,It is the most delicious Indian restaurant in my life. The service is good and price is reasonable..
Amazing food at Ras in Singapore,"The food and service at Ras in Singapore was excellent. The lobster masala curry, the garlic naan, dhal makhani and the butter chicken curry were delicious and I would highly recomend this restaurant. They are also open till late! If you feel like eating fabulous Indian food in Singapore, visit Ras!"
"Good Food, Friendly Staff",Food was good. Service was good. Friendly staff. Prices are bit high but acceptable compared to rest of clark Quay.
Best indian food in singapore,"I had Indian food allover Singapore but I think it is one of the best North indian food i had it here,loved it,its a sure visit,located at river front in Clarke quay.
Don’t miss it."
"Quality food, with great and fast service","Authentic North Indian food right at the heart of Singapore. Food was simply delicious and service was very quick.
Masala Kulchas are a must try!"
Excellent Indian food,"Great service and even better food. Already went there twice in the last 5 days, the masala kulcha is to die for. Say hello to Mr.Senthil and Mr.Ajeesh who will greet you with a smile and will help you choose from the extensive menu."
"Excellent service, lovely food",I visited Ras twice in my recent stay in Singapore. The service was excellent particularly Mr Ajesh who remembered what I had in their restaurant in my earlier visit. The food was good. Would surely recommend this place
"Way, way overpriced!","At least Dick Turpin work a mask! Charged over 30 dollars for a Bloody Mary and a small bottle of beer! Avoid drinks here, so expensive, didn’t eat here so unable to comment. I suppose that you are surcharged for the location, right on the river."
Clarke Quay Visit,Had a great time with family at Clarke Quay and had food at Ras. The food was very good and the service was excellent. Ajeesh and his staff was very friendly and accommodating. Recommend to everyone who wants to taste good Indian food.
Honeymoon mneal- 16th Nov,"I agree with other reviewers. The food is good, but very expensive. I was also overcharged: S$52 for drinks we did not order or receive. I have emailed the restauarant, but no response yet."
Fabulous start to our holiday,Ras is a brilliant restaurant. As you walk through Clarke Quay the smells lure you in. The staff led by Ajeesh Nair are so friendly and accommodating. We wanted a table by the window and they did everything to find us one even though it was extremely busy. The food is gorgeous. Great flavours and so much to choose from. We will definitely be back before we leave!
Great Food in Lovely Location,"Had a beautifully fragrant prawn biryani here. The rice was soft, and the spicing was perfectly blended. Even though I'd asked for the hot version, it wasn't overpowering in the least. The portion was huge: five large shell-on-prawns and a mountain of rice. I couldn't finish it. The meal came with poppadums and a freshly made raita. Be aware though that a meal here isn't cheap: you're paying for the waterfront location and a chance to escape the incessant traffic. Adding on a couple of drinks and tax, it cost upwards of $65, worth it though as it was my last night in town."
Truly Indian!,"Amazing location and ambience, variety of dishes and cusines, authentic taste and above all very courteous and polite staff and also the Manager. All in all a wonderful dining experience. A place that is a must visit in Singapore for all the foodies!"
40th Birthday spice,"After having cocktails in Altitude we had a craving for an Indian and headed down to Clarke Quay to Ras. This restaurant was excellent got us a very good table quick and it was looking over the river.
The food is very tasty here and with good service. The manager Ajeesh and shamarla looked after us and even though Is was very very busy all are requests were attended to.
Thank you so very much for making my Birthday meal a special one to remember!"
Great Ambience by the River with good food,"The location o fthe restaurant is excellent - by the river. The night views are dramatically different form the afternoon one.
the food is standard North Indian fare- but very well prepared.
we ate vegetarian on Diwali and the special menu was good. The Vegetable dish was fantastic with unique flavours. The Paneer Kurchan has pillowy soft paneer in a yellow gravy! I guess I didn't expect that as the name kurchan led me to believe that it would be a dry ""scrambled paneer"" style dish. But nevertheless, it was tasty.
the service was good. So was the starter tandoori gobi.

Overall a good evening - though my pocket was quite light after the meal costing about $ 35 per head! with no drinks - mind you.
But good for celebratory occasions."
Overcharged,Didn't realise until we got home and checked the visa statement that we were overcharged for our meal.
Nice location,"I'm quite sure this is a nice place considering the number of people who dine there. I'm not into spicy food though and could have ordered food that doesn't suit my palate. Hahaha
Servings are big, view superb plus the location is perfect.
Kinda pricey though."
Authentic Indian food in Singapore.,"On my recent trip to Singapore we happened to visit Ras at Clarke Quay.
I must say taste wise ,it was as authentic as it can be (I have had terrible food being passed off as Indian food abroad).
Dal Tadka ,Chicken Biryani and Paneer were well prepared and full of flavors.
They made it less spicy for the children.
Good and prompt service.
They serve filtered water as an option,unlike other restaurants in the area which charge a bomb for the water.
Price is on the higher side.
One can opt for indoor seating or outdoor seating overlooking the Singapore river."
"Great food, Superb Ambience and Amazing Service","We were looking for a place to eat at Clarke Quay and were invited in by Ajeesh. Our first reaction was maybe not but went in because of his pleasing personality and assurance of the quality of the food. There were some offers on the beer which we took and asked Ajeesh for recommendations on the starters. He recommended a mushroom starter for my vegetarian friends and a chicken malai kabab for us. He followed it up with some delicious prawn koliwada and succinctly juicy lamb chops. The food, the ambience and the staff at this place are all really amazing and together they ensure that you never leave without a smile."
"Great curry,",Stopped here for a curry by the Riverside with my wife. Great staff. Fantastic food. Good ambience. Highly recommended. Not sure what else to say really. Cheers guys!
Good curry,"Stopped for a curry and were not disappointed, great chicken masala and dhal,big portions, nice naan and poppadoms with chopped tomatoes chillis onoins on top.
Service ok , couple of issues re order( she didn’t write it down)but overall goog"
Great! Especially for vegetarians,"My wife is a vegetarian and this is the first time I’ve been to a non-veggie restaurant and she’s had more choice than me.

Honestly cannot fault anything with our food or the service. Mr Nair the restaurant manager was friendly and helped us choose interesting dishes which we for the most part hadn’t had before.

Not cheap as others have complained but you would pay a lot more for a similar quality meal in London.

Fully recommended."
"Overly Priced, not value for money","I understand Restaurants in Singapore are expensive and then especially at Clarke Quay but still RAS I found to be overly priced. The food quality was just ok. I ordered some bar b que, butter chicken, and a soup. I have eaten similar dishes at other restaurants much better than here and at much cheaper price even in Singapore. The space inside the restaurant was also too congested which didnt make the dining experience comfortable."
Good but expensive,"We like Indian food and this restaurant lived up to it's reputation for very good food, efficiently served by friendly waiters. They catered for gluten free options too. From the food point of views I'd go again, but (at least for us) it was a tad expensive- one shared starter, 2 main meals and bottle of wine for $180 (£100 sterling). Fortunately we kept to our own choice of wine and was not persuaded by the waiter then suggesting we change it for a bottle at twice the price. A bit unnecessary pressure really."
Tasty food,"The food was really tasty, it was slightly hot though even if they say it’s mild. Good gluten free options. Good view but tables very close together. Service sometimes was excellent and sometimes average."
Good food & service,"Have dined here now a number of times over the years and our recent experience (twice during our 10 day stay) has shown that the quality of their food & service has been maintained.
The friendly staff always advise if your choice is hot and ask what level of spice you would like. Food is excellent, portions are very generous and is some cases could easily be shared for 2 persons. Price wise not too expensive & comparative with all the other restaurants in the area.
Can get busy if you want to eat on the quay side, but a wait in the inside is well worth it. Will definitely be coming here next time we are in SG."
Lovely Indiad beside the river,"We visited this restaurant last week, and I have to report it was one of the best I have had, the mix of spices was very tasty indeed.
My sons girlfriend is vegan, the staff could not do enough for us, when Lucy said to me it was a bit to spicy, they immediately took it away and prepared another less spicy for her, that's what I call service!
If I am ever passing through again, I will most defiantly return."
Good Indian Food,"I love their Kebab Platter and Lamb Biryani. Both are a must try. Service is quite good even during busy hours on weekends. When the whether is not too warm, it is good to chose outdoor seating."
Fantastic lamb dishes,Table for 2. We both ordered lamb dishes. Melt in the mouth ! Exceptional. We have eaten Indian god throughout the world and this was probably the best
Great food,"Had paneer kurchan, which was absolutely fantastic. Also a mango margarita, which seemed like an uncommon choice. Service seemed hit or miss - my server was thoroughly disinterested, but another waiter walking back and forth to the outdoor patio was very friendly (and more helpful than my server).
Definitely recommend.
Oh: fair warning: food was spicy!"
Very good,"Nice view, nice people working there, nice food. A bit expensive but really delicious. One of the best restaurant in the street"
Excellent Indian food,The Indian food served here is excellent and at par with any of the good restaurants back in India. Whenever am in Singapore love to eat here
"Good food, good service","we had a butter chicken and a Vindaloo with saffron rice and a couple of side narn breads etc.
pleasantly hot vindaloo was great.
Recommended"
Decent Place,We were a group of 12 people. We ordered North Indian vegetables and breads. The food was decent enough and service was average.
Service A+,"Service and food were excellent. Very happy with the wait staff, their recommendations and attention were first class. Even when dealing with a challenging table near us, nothing was too difficult. We’ll definitely be back!"
RAS with friends,"The best India food I ever eat! I recommended that restaurant to all who want to taste real flavour of India, omnom :)"
Nice cocktails,"Had our first taste of a Singapore Sling here and it was very nice as was the Cucumber Mojito - at buy one get one free! Chose restaurant as reviews seems ok and husband wanted Indian. Wouldn’t really rate the food, a lot spicier than we normally have and no options to choose preferred heat, taste also a lot different to what we are used to and double the price too"
Magical,"Wanted Indian food and found this place.
Amazing food, soooooo Nice servers, Perfect enviroment. I’ll be back"
The ultimate place for Indian cuisine in Clarke Quay!,"This is the only Indian restaurant in Clarke Quay. We dined at RAS on multiple occasions during our stay at Novotel and were pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of food and service. Kudos to manager Ajeesh and his team for their excellent service despite the usual rush most of the time. Must try butter chicken, shahi panner and lachha parantha!"
Food average but price high,"As expected in a tourist hot spot, the food was average and the price high. Was close to our hotel so made the mistake of going here one night when we didn’t want to venture too far. It’s perfectly fine if you want ok food and to be ripped off at bill time but I wouldn’t go back here, we really didn’t like the dishes we chose."
