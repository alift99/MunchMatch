Italian fine dining,"Good Italian fine dining restaurant. On the 27th floor- so disappointed that there was no view. But good food, good ambience and great Sevice. Tried the calamari and Burrata that were good. Folks in my group raves about the grilled lamb"
No value for money,"I visited OSO Ristorante on September 27, 2022 for business dinner along with my foreign delegates, although the food was good but it was too little portion to eat and not worth for the price we paid..."
Not very good customer service!,"I have to say that I was very disappointed with my last visit to Oso, especially cos I frequent that place and recommend friends to it!! Being a regular customer, all I requested for, was for a particular table on my next visit , which was a month away! Sooooo disappointed!!! Cos they gave some excuse that they cannot promise me any table as they could have other bookings with more people in the future!!! Seriously?? I am a regular customer, and you turn such a minor request down!! I was extremely disappointed! I have been to other restaurants of the same calibre or less, AND THEY HAVE FULFILLED MY REQUEST.I have to say that the manager was very rude and lacked customer service!"
Disappointing,"Very poor service. We waited a long time for drinks before being served apperatives.
Then wine was warm and half way through main course before making a fuss that we were poured wine with our main course.
Not what we expected for the price and reputation."
Don’t order the crab pasta,"I visited OSO Ristorante at Oasia Hotel on 2 April 2022 with my family to celebrate my daughter’s birthday. We had the burrata and the calamari as starters. Both of these were very good. Most of the dishes we ordered for our main course were also good, including the veal cutlet, pork belly and the ravioli.
However, what was extremely disappointing was the crab with angel hair pasta dish. The crab did not taste fresh but my sister-in-law decided not to make a fuss and ate it. My sister had also ordered the dish but she only managed to eat half of it as she did not like the taste of it. Unfortunately, true to our worst fears, the crab pasta dish led to a night of diarrhoea for both my sister and sister-in-law.
The other disappointing dish was the pasta with sea urchin. There wasn’t much of the sea urchin in the dish and it was hard to tell that that was supposed to be the main ingredient in the dish.
A little more effort with the salad that accompanied the veal would have been appreciated, considering the price of the dish.
The service by the staff was good and I appreciate the fact that the birthday cake that I had brought was apportioned very well for all of us. It would have been better if the restaurant had provided a complimentary slice, as had been stated when I had enquired if that was done.
Finally, it would also have been good if I had been sent a text confirmation of my reservation, as I had been told would happen when I called to make the reservation. Not having any confirmation was quite disconcerting and I had to call the restaurant to make sure of the reservation, since I did not wish to disappoint my guests. In the end, an even more embarrassing thing happened as 2 of my guests had such an unpleasant experience."
Birthday lunch,We had the 3-course $38++ set lunch and it was an amazing meal. The service was top notch and food so delicious. I was walking with crutches and the waiters were extremely attentive. To changing my tables to arranging my crutches to assisting me by holding the doors to the restrooms totally on their own initiative. The food was truly delicious and service incomparable. They even remembered my hubby’s birthday cake which was complimentary. The ambience was luxurious with chandeliers and Hollywood doyens gracing the walls and soothing jazz music all contributing to an elegant relaxed restaurant setting.
Wonderful customer service,"Doing my January detox I wasn’t going to be the easiest of customers. Dairy free and gluten-free was absolutely no problem. Not only did they accommodate me, they seemed to enjoy showing me what they could do. And it was amazing for sure.
I brought with me my own gluten-free beer and everything I asked for was happily delivered to my table. So often restaurants make me feel uncomfortable when I ask for something not on the menu. We are recommending Oso to everyone. Chef Diego, we’ll be back soon for sure."
Worth A Visit,"Loved the decor, which is a bit of NYC loft, eclectic and Chinois. Service staff were attentive and filled up drinks readily.

Foodwise, it was mostly hits. The cioppino was good while the calamari were cooked perfectly, without being too rubbery. The bread also went well with the olive oil.

Just a tad surprised there were no pizzas, especially as the chef is from the Lombardy region. We opted for the prawn orichette and the waiter suggested the crabmeat angelhair. The crabmeat pasta was tasty, almost like a dry laksa or mee siam, while the orichette was okay and the prawns were fresh. The pasta was a tad hard. However, the ladies who had the cioppino felt the taste of the soup and the two pastas were quite similar.

The salted caramel gelato and the mango sorbet were hood and a nice end to the meal."
Good Italian,"Good, solid Italian cuisine with relatively high price tag. Service good be a bit more attentive and knowledgeable. Decent wine list, unfortunately no good Grappa"
Great food and amazing service,"Recently tried the restaurant week menu and was impressed with the delicious food and even more so with the attentive and impeccable service, especially from K. Thanks to the Oso team we enjoyed a lovely annoversary dinner!"
Great Italian,We had a great evening at Oso: service was attentive and thoughtful (they split our pastas for us) and had good recommendations. The bread and dishes were great but only the fish was just OK. Definitely a place to return to for tasty pasta!
Authentic Italian restaurant!,Whole experience from start to finish is great. The place is beautiful. Food is very tasty and well prepared. Highly recommend!
Fell short of expectation,"Took advantage of restaurant week to try out the restaurant. Expectation was heighten with the great reviews and service of the restaurant, but was disappointed. Ambience was nice, service was prompt and great. The waiters are attentive and and took great efforts to explain the dishes, and serve the condiments.

Full marks for the menu because every single item looks like a must try from the description. The combination of the food was pretty unusual, did add to the taste and texture of the experience but pity that the fish and the steak (ordered medium rare, ended up medium well) was overcooked though. Pretty intrigued by the duck which was served in a cube. Presentation was definitely scoring high on that dish, personally, would have preferred the duck meat to be more mixed.

For me the best dish was the dessert and coffee.. enjoyed the truffle pasta as well."
Excellent choice,Oso is classy and an excellent choice for restaurant week. Very easy to get to as it is beside the Tanjong Pagar mrt station. The restaurant is located on the 27th floor beside the swimming pool. We loved the 5 course dinner as each item tease our palate. The flavors really surprised us especially the burrata and the truffle infused gelato. We will certainly return for more of the delicious angel hair crabmeat arrabiata and the warm onion focaccia bread. A very delightful experience thanks to their welcoming staff and delectable treats. Highly recommended for your next special date.
Yes! A new place for us to frequent!,"Always heard of Oso and finally we decided to give it a try. What a nice surprise! Reception was fast and courteous. We had a nice corner table but I wish our table can be bigger and a place to put my small bag? it was rather awkward as I've to put my phone and clutch bag on my seat otherwise the table is not capable to host more.

We had starter Tuna Carpaccio and Burrata. My god! They're so good! Both of us have fish as main. I had the whole sea bream while partner has Black Cod. They were beautifully presented and they also give me a nice big bowl of chili padi! LOVE!

We had an excellent bottle of Chardonnay at SGD 128.

Toilet is clean and even had tag cards that said if restroom needs attention pls take that card and give it to any of their staff. What a great initiative! 5 star for that.

The only thing I hope they can do better is their Gluten Free bread. Is rather sad. Chef's Table and No Menu make SUPERB Gluten free bread (hope they can get some ideas from them soon :))"
Excellent,Excellent menu and service. Food was delicious. Cheese selection and service best I have experienced. Wine list very good
Our new favorite Italian restaurant...,"We've been to Oso Ristorante before their move to Oasia Hotel and found it very pleasant and convenient if you're around the Tanjong Pagar CBD.

The restaurant is indeed Italian with its regional focus -- Puglia, Sicily, etc. Food is still of same consistent high standard. My husband's Filetto was well balanced; the truffle puree did not overwhelm the flavors, my Orecchiette pasta with prawn bisque was spectacular.

The wine list is very thoughtful and service is of a high standard, and uniformly friendly and thoughtful.

We prefer the banquette tables with poolside lights coming through the windows.
Overall this restaurant is a great ambience for small parties and intimate dining, and will be back with friends when the current restriction of 2 person is lifted in July."
"Food was great, but was lacking","Food was great, but was lacking in service. From we arrived were told to finish up within 1 hr 45 min. Was reminded several times. We asked for a new bottle of wine but were told there was not enough time to drink it !! Will not return!"
Business lunch,"The srt comes with 48++ price tag. Ambience is nice, penne pasta and lamb shank both were good , same goes for Formaggio. Overall pleasant experience"
Quality of food has gone downhill,"Quality of food has gone downhill since they moved from Bukit Pasoh. Pasta was particularly weak across the board - bad texture, rabbit pasta was bland. Tomahawk steak was good but unremarkable. Really sad to see it lose its way like this."
One of the best Italian in Singapore!,"Amazing ambience, delicious food, superb service are the three reasons why I will return! Pictures tell a thousand words. Please see for yourself! I have uploaded."
Disappointing cuisine,"Service was friendly and attentive. The food was disappointing. The Smoked cauliflower tasted very bland. The Angel hair pasta was too soggy. And the Black Angus tenderloin was truly disappointing, very tough and almost impossible to chew."
"simple, basic menu, but cooked really well","Located slightly off CBD on the 27th floor of a hotel, the interior of this eatery is quite impressive. Huge portraits of legendary actresses and singers adorned the walls, creating an OTT dinning atmosphere.

After the ohs and wows of the interior, the menu can be a bit of a let down. You would expect something equally exciting, no? Unfortunately, the whole menu is very simple, even predictable.

Thank goodness, simple predictable dishes yes - but they were well executed. From beef and tuna carpaccio, to deep fried calamari and tomahawk. Well seasoned, well cooked. Especially the risotto and pasta - al dente! So so satisfying!!!

Ok, we were not impressed with the “traditional” tiramisu - for the lack of coffee liqueur. But the service crews from the managers to wait staffs all made up for it. They were attentive, personable, helpful - it’s literally like 15mins into the dinner we are friends. So impressive!"
Very good “Limon-Hello” set lunch!,“Limon-hello” set lunch was such good quality and value. With an additional glass of limoncello spitz at sgd12++. Cauliflower puree with crab meat and caviar as starter was such a treat. The beef bolognaise pasta was in smaller portion. Sea- bass was cooked in light sauce. Lovely atmosphere and attentive staff service. They took the initiative to provide gluten free bread.
"Amazing, personal, fabulous service and out of this world food!","I would like to say just how wonderful this restaurant is. Why? It is truly one of the few that manages to balance and blend a personal service with such amazing food in a fabulous environment.

I booked an exceptionally special wedding anniversary meal at what was short notice with the wonderful Watson. Not only did he support me through email but in person too. I loved the options presented to me and that these could cater for all budgets, especially in this current world. The pre- event service was wonderful and my expectations from having my dreams shattered with the C-19 travel restrictions meaning our trip and renewal was off, were now built and possibly exceeded due to such wonderful suggestions, support and anticipation of the fabulous culinary wonder that awaited us.
When it came to the event, a special meal created from the OSO superb menu options and a small amount of tailor-made magic, including guests with food allergies, vegetarians and those in need of very particular wine requirements; all taken in their stride and were flawless!
The evening had everything and more that I cannot find a combination of words to describe. The wine selection, beautiful descriptions (perfect for our guests) and staggeringly amazing food that stopped conversation for a moment due to beauty and exquisite flavours; all made the special occasion perfect. I, frankly, was glad the C-19 had made our plans change.
Whether you are a single person, couple, you have date night ambitions or a very, very special occasion in mind; OSO is the restaurant for you. Somehow it achieves excellent ambience, service that is intuitive yet not over-the-top and food that you can not only taste the full flavours of, but the love in it.
We have already rebooked for a date night and another special occasion."
5 Nov 2020,"Booked this place for a birthday dinner with my sister & friends. Loved its decor. Ordered calamari, caprese, angel hair crabmeat pasta, & had quite a few awesome desserts! The Tiramisu is a must-have. As for the sherbet, I liked the Yuzu better.. service was great. Very friendly & approachable staff! Fabulous place to chill for the night with ur girlfriends or as a couple. Suggest to book early. It’s full even on a weekday!"
Beautifully Italian restaurant,"Beautifully Italian restaurant

I celebrated my birthday with a couple of friends. We were the first customers to walk and the last customer to walk out.

We appreciate good Italian food and good wine.

Food was good, service was great and wine was amazing.

The staff, Mario went above and beyond to serve us. He was well equipped with his food and wine knowledge.

For starters, we had Burata which was so soft and tasty. Cold cuts were amazing. As for main, we had lamb cutlets which was good, crab linguine was just ok, confit duck was ok. Dessert, we had a cheese platter which went very well with the red wine.

Overall we have amazing experience."
Incredible,"From the moment I spoke to the reservations team to the last sip of Limoncello, our entire experience at your restaurant was wonderful, the service infallible and friendly, the food exquisite, the ambiance relaxed yet classy.
Totally loved it as did my Italian friends.
It was especially great for me as I’m coeliac and dairy intolerant and there was no issue in ordering, the meals devine."
Wedding Anniversary Dinner to remember,"Having discovered OSO with a work colleague I had planned to bring my wife when we went into lockdown. We had a great OSO meal delivered for her birthday and finally got to enjoy the full experience tonight. Everything was perfect, from the welcome and impeccable service to the wonderfully varied Singapore Birthday tasting menu. Topped off with a special anniversary dessert to finish. Just the relaxed evening we wanted with some fabulous flavours of Italy."
Amazing dining experience.,"What an amazing dining experience we had. Thank you to Stephane and his team to make our dinner so special. It was my wife birthday and I gotta say everything was amazing. Chef coming out of his way to introduce himself to us, as well as the food which was honestly speaking very nicely executed. Thanks again for this great dinner we will be back."
Huge Disappointment,"Myself and my girlfriends were there for my birthday dinner 2 days ago and what a shame it was a huge disappointment. They hosted us poorly.
My bestfriend asked for a non alcoholic beverage menu and the waiter Daniello said he would bring it over. We reminded him again for the drink menu and he said it is coming. After a good 30 mins wait he brought over a drink and placed it infront of my bestfriend with no explanation . We said we did not order this drink and he said it is the only mocktail available and didn’t even bother to explain what was the ingredients used in the drink until asked and he just lamely explained that it consist of some juices and sugar. We declined the drink. During our dinner we had to get the attention of the waiters numerous times to heed to our request.
On one occasion I highlighted to one of the waiter that we would like another bottle of the same drink and she told Daniello as such and he lamely uttered ‘ yeah yeah ‘ which I would assume he would bring us the bottle in due time. However I saw him moving from one table to another to attend to the needs of others and simply ignored my request. We had to ask another waiter again for the bottle. This is really not service at all coming from a reputable restaurant.
To add to the unpleasant experience another waiter Julian ended our night with utmost disrespect. He whisked away our glasses without even asking if he could do so and when I asked him why he did so he simply responded that he already informed us earlier that they would be clearing our glasses at the aforesaid time. As far as I’m
concerned, no one came to inform me of this. Both their behaviours are very unbecoming and rude.
I am greatly surprised of the standard of service provided at such a restaurant. To add to that the food quality has dropped from when the restaurant operated at Bukit Pasoh. This is unacceptable for any guest especially accompanying a celebration. We are greatly displeased with the performance of this restaurant."
Never EVER disappoints!! 5 Stars,"Absolutely one of my favourites in Singapore - for business and for private dining . The food is exceptional and so well prepared , but have to mention also the ambience and the service . The team takes care of you all the way and with a super personal touch Highest recommendation."
Charming and pleasant,"We came for dinner on a Saturday evening. Service is good, the chef is humourous and personable. The ambience is friendly and cosy, yet spacious. The food was rather disappointing - the lobster tail was too salty, the foie-gras could be much better prepared, the Gnocchi was not memorable. Only the tenderloin was good, well balanced and tender. Good cheese selection. Still, a pleasant evening in a popular dining place."
The most amazing Italian restaurant in Singapore,"The most delicious food paired with the kindest hosts, this restaurant is truly one of a kind and the family always loves eating here. The menu is so diverse and absolutely everything tastes phenomenal. The ambience is also incredible, truly one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The selection of cheeses is a highlight!"
Worth the experience,"The server was very friendly, they have a nice ambience and undeniable great foods! Will definitely come back :)"
Gorgeous place,"Dinner at OSO was amazing, great selection of wine, had house pour Chabli and truly delicious Italian food, very healthy as I had crab meat salad and grilled sea bass. Also perfect size of portions, definitely will be back ❤️"
❤️,"I was there so many times and every time food was perfect, my favourite restaurant in Singapore!!❤️❤️"
Faultless as always,"Dined with a group of friends at Oso for the St Valentine's menu. As always everything was faultless. The restaurant was full with a great atmosphere and the menu well thought out, luxurious and offered great value for money. Having lived here for 12 years Oso remains the most consistent and polished all round dining experience in Singapore."
"Great ambience..........highly personal chef/ownerr, Diego",The restauratnt conveys a very strong visual positive ambience. Food is innovative and delicious. Service is exemplary. Highly recommend this italian restaurant.

Great restaurant with an amazing atmosphere,"The place was quite busy during lunch time, but some tables were available The food was great, and the service was excellent Definitely will be back for lunch or dinner before leaving Singapore"
Peaceful Atmosphere in the Heart of Singapore,"A wonderful restaurant poised on the top of the Oasia Hotel. This restaurant (or rather, Ristorante) is a lovely little Italian retreat in the midst of Asia. Come here for authentically delicious dishes prepared by truly caring chefs. I had the pleasure of having the Chef's Customized menu, which the chef personally brought out dish by dish. I recommended anyone who is interested in the atmosphere of a dining establishment to try out Oso Ristorante. You will be fed and cared for by the most excellent staff."
Will be back,"Very good food, warm welcome, and excellent service! The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice and the area is beautiful with plants and pool outside."
Miss Vivian,"The place is really nice, and the food is amazing! All the staff are kind and the service is really fast!"
reliable italian cusine in CBD area,"Oso is now in the Osia Hotel in Tanjong Pagar. It has always had a good reputation for its italian cuisine. Tender beef and good chicken . Needless to say , good pasta and risotto . I am sure their desert is good too, although I did not have it. The poolside ambiance is nice for diners."
Outstanding!,"Authentic Italian food. Great atmosphere, good selection of wine. The menu offers a wide variety of delicious and mouth-watering starters. Ravioli was delicious and risotto exquisite. I highly recommend going to Oso restaurant."
One of the best choices in SIngapore Tanjong Pagar area,"One of the best choices in Singapore. Very unique atmosphere, very nice food tastes, very good wine cava. The staff is very friendly and the service is excellent. A must dine restaurant."
Fantastic atmosphere,Great night with fantastic food and relaxed ambiance. 82% dark chocolate tart with milk icecream was incredible!
Lovely rooftop restaurant,Oso is run by Italians who have been in Singapore for quite some time. Authentic Italian food presented with sincerity and panache. A lovely place whether for a business lunch or dinner with friends. The pasta dishes are great and do leave space for desserts.
Dinner at oso,Beautiful restaurant nice polite staff amezing food would be amezing for a date night or family dinner nice atmosphere amezing view
New location presents a beautiful view of the central business district,"Food quality has at least maintained, and I might even add, improved, from the previous location. Service is good. For a business lunch, this location offers convenience, great food and service."
Romantic Dining,"It was nice and quiet, situated on the highest floor of Oasia Hotel.
Very romantic lightings.

Server was very helpful in recommending dishes.

I was very happy with the salad and the octopus.

My husband ordered a pasta and felt like it was a little too hard. Taste was good.

It was overall a very good dining experience."
Must visiting,"Very cozy place, nice restaurant with great sense of style and great food. Singapore decoration, I recommend visiting, and definitely have a dessert!♥️"
Perfect lunch,Such a nice place with great service and atmosphere. Wonderful food. For sure I will be back to this place!
"Lovely food, great service","Great Italian food and wine selection, service was excellent. Slightly pricey for pasta but worth it for a treat!"
Perfect lunch,"Thanks for the best service and amazing food. My recommendation is prawns with vegetables, chocolate with mint and of course tomato’s ceviche (not sure about the name). Would love to come back soon!"
Good fine dining,"The food especially the starter bread are really good. I like the ambient, the light, very nice selection of music. I am surprised that they even have live saxophone performance.
We went on Sunday 6 Oct, arrived on time for our reservation.
The restaurant was not very busy that time, perhaps the manpower is not enough, we were not noticed our arrival, we waited for a while to get seated. It took a while to take our order and to get a bill too. It would be nice to improve the Service."
Amazing experience,"Great place, so well located! The food was amazing and the service as well! DefinitelyI will come back"
Great Ambience,"Very good fine dining restaurant with a great ambience on 27th floor and beside the pool.
Like the place for Business Meetings. Price bit on higher side . We had a set lunch salad + main course + a desert ( quantity very small though) and 4 coffee for four people cost us 230 SGD or so .
Though quantity is as very small but taste was good ."
Delicous food,"It was a very good restaurant, wonderful staff, delicous food, comfortable atmosphere. I will definitely come back!"
Favorite place in Singapore!,Ready to come here every day! Everything is very tasty! Romantic and at the same time business atmosphere! The design of the dishes is incredible! Thanks so much for everything!
I felt in love with chocolate cake 😍,"Recommend this restaurant for 100%%%
and also recommend you to try 3-course set menu.
I’m such a big fan of dessert, the Chef just made my dreams come true with the chocolate cake.
All the staff was so communicable with me, and they were trying to talk with every client, it’s so cute, how i think
Love and recommend this place!"
Recommend,"Been here twice already, amazing food, good service, delicious wines, as nice atmosphere if you are in Singapore a must to visit"
Frequent customer!,I would definitely recommend the 3-course set menu. Delicious food every time. Very friendly service and nice atmosphere.
Really love this place!,"I’ve visited this place plenty of times and I can tell that it’s an amazing restaurant. There are not only delicious kitchen but nice atmosphere and very friendly staff. I can recommend to try for desserts-dark chocolate mousse, pistachio frozen parfait, for the main course- oven baked eggplant with crab meat. Highly recommend to visit OSO ristorante in Singapore:)"
Little Italy,A beautiful Italian place in Singapore. The staff is very friendly and kind. The chef surprised us with the mild taste of fish with an orange touch! That was unforgettable. Definitely recommend
Best,"The dishes were beautifully presented, appetizing and very cozy, thank you so much! Will come again and again!"
Definitely coming back,"This place with great atmosphere and kindly staff highly recommend for solo lunch or can be also nice as date-spot. Food is perfect, enjoyed my time here."
"Cosy environment, quick service",We had 3 course lunch here complementary from DBS Asia Treasures. The food is quite tasty and the service is quick. Restaurant decor is cosy and food is nicely presented.
Great Dinner,"A restaurant with sophisticated decor and good italian food. Their prawn bisque,cod fish, angel hair crab meat pasta and beef are excellent. Desserts are great too especially tiramisu and panna cotta. A great place for either a romantic dinner or gathering for girlfriends."
Birthday dinner,"It was a rather disappointing experience after hearing so much about the restaurant. The service was definitely poor from the in-set with no attention given to us after we were seated. It took more than half an hour before our orders were taken. Definitely not expected of a restaurant of this standing.

Maybe they have gotten too confident of themselves. The food itself was average and could have been better. There was no interaction from the service staff on recommendations of the food."
Great evening .. nice atmosphere and good food,"I see the reviews and some of the haters however, I like the place. I like the vibe, food and wine.

Recommend the burrata and tomahawk both of which were very good.

Restaurant allows corkage at $40 per bottle was reasonable.

Price in end completely reasonable for SIngapore and would definitely go again.

Pre dinner Gin in Cin Cin recommended."
Birthday party at OSO.,Just fabulous. . . pulled out all of the stops! Wonderful all round. . . Service. Food. Wine. Birthday cake! Thanks OSO.
Superb ambience & food,"One of my long term faves but had not visited since their relocation. Normally I'm very cautious about hotel located restaurants.
This is located top of the new Oasia hotel and I must admit was taken aback by the quality and vibe of the fit out..totally fantastic, hotel restaurants can be cold this feels inclusive and cozy even though spacious.
On moving the food and service has lost none of its quality.... Superb..

Well done."
Disappointed with chef,"I actually was looking forward to dining here since the last time I went, they were at Tanjong Pagar, and I wanted to choose them for my wedding in the private room. That said I was emailing to and from with the restaurant on chef recommendation on substitute ingredients without sugar, carb and gluten as I was allergic to them. However it was super frustrating when I tried ordering. The chef was too busy to meet us to recommend something despite them all knowing my requirements days prior. The manager kept insisting the food they serve me is gluten free but it is actually made from wheat, which is a carb. Then he pushed me quinoa pasta which I am forbidded because of the carb load. It is really difficult to eat out. In the end I ordered a small tenderloin fillet because that's the only thing I can take. Paid 400 for the meal, exit and turned around somewhere else to packet takeaway home to fill up"
Birthday dinner,Made a reservation via chope and left a special request for a mini surprise cake for my boyfriend as we were celebrating his birthday at Oso Ristorante. I received a reply shortly after from the restaurant saying that they have received my special request which I was very impressed! Ambience was great! Foie Gras and lobster pasta was really delicious however the risotto with sea urchin was hard and the seafood was not fresh at all. Overall great experience :)
Excellent experience,"Stunning interior in a New York soho style. Exceptional menu with a delicious desert offering. The choice of prime beef, fish and and pork jowl with macallan sauce) is difficult to choose from. To end it all a personal cheese vault for every taste. A must try when in Singapore."
Old favourite,"We have been consistently pleased with our meals here whenever in town. Great ambience , friendly efficient service & great Italian food. Recommend the Iberico ham , lobster fettuccine but in fact have never had a bad meal here ,will keep coming back whenever we are in Singapore."
Excellent lunch,Had a business lunch here and found it to be both a very pleasant place to be as well as great food. We all had a steak and they were cooked to perfection! Service was nice and fast during lunch.
"Very nice ambience, blah food",It has a great setting on the 27th floor of hotel and surrounded by hotel pool. Unfortunately was very not impressed with the food.
Bad food,"We ordered 4 courses. Soup was terrible, pasta was average, beef was average, the dessert tart was raw. Food is not as expectation. And this was consistent amongst the 5 of us."
Outstanding Authentic Italian,"Oso is absolutely outstanding. The restaurant is superb, the service is excellent and the food divine."
Ambience was good but Food was average,"Had the Zander Ng set menu. First two dishes started off well, but the Lobster on the 3rd dish was over seasoned and over cooked slightly. The 4th dish of Beef Tenderloin was the big let down. I think they sous vide it for too long or the meat itself wasn't that good, texture of the beef was grainy and slightly mushy. Wasn't impressed by the dessert too, the Marsala Sabayon was warm which made the dessert feels quite heavy. Didn't feel it was worth the $100++..."
Classy Italian restaurant with good food,"Came here with my family for a weekend dinner. The food is reasonably priced for the portion and quality. Chef takes great pains to make sure that the food is tasty and well arranged. We had the steak, Spainish Ham and Angel Hair pasta, there were also plentiful bread given to go with the mains. We also ordered glasses of wine, it was really good. The ambiance is great, very centrally located and carpark is ample. Will definitely come here again!"
A little slice of Italian heaven,"An amazing place to be at for a dinner with family or friends, excellent service given by the staff."
Experianced review,"I felt compelled to leave this review after reading the entries here about OSO in singapore. I first visited this restaurant by recommendation nine years ago at their old location. Being a foodie I was more than ready to be critical. Test one...question the waitress to see if she knows her stuff. She did.
Test two the food....The beef carpaccio starter was to die for. The main course steak was even better. Perfectly cooked succulent medium center with that well cooked perfectly seasoned outer giving that strong beef flavour. It was a wow.
Nothing was beating that until the lava cake with vanilla ice cream OMG I could have eaten until I exploded.
Test three and one test that most restaurants in Singapore fail at dismally.... the service. One of the two owners running front of house introduced himself and paid genuine attention to us. I was impressed. I described the red I like without name (not being a wine expert) and got a Borolo. Exactly what I was looking for.
Over the years OSO has been my absolute number one Italian in Asia. The one I take my clients to impress them. The service is exactly what most say here ... IMPECABLE. Want to impress a girl? Impress your new client? This is the place to go. OSO is restaurant that as my wife and I travel around the world eating our favourite food (Italian) we often say, “well it’s not OSO is it”!?
Something else that impresses me is Diago, co-owner and head Chef...he appears at front of house regularly during service making sore the food was perfect for his clientele. I have a young boy who loves spaghett bolognese...not on the menu. Not only did OSO make my boy his favourite dish off menu but Diago came from the kitchen to make sure he knew how he liked it and it was satisfactory. That attention to care even for a child, my child choked me with a smile so big it made my night.
It’s not just about the food and the service... It’s the atmosphere. There are so many regulars that treat OSO as their go to restaurant there’s this relaxed, warm, fun feel. It’s alive and has its own beat. Almost unique in this sense. It’s no way just a restaurant it’s an event that leaves you feeling like you’ve been on an outing not just had some food.
Oh and it’s just about only place in town that makes a perfect Irsh coffee.
One last thing that I feel should be praised...the evolution. There’s always something new. The latest is a collection of the finest wiskies I have ever seen in a restaurant.
If you’re looking for a place where you are made to special every time and your palette thinks you’ve died and gone heaven this IS the place to go.
Of course you get what you pay for...it’s not he cheapest Italian in a Singapore. It’s by far not the most expensive. BUT it is without a shadow of a doubt THE BEST in a Singapore and the best for us. American Express agree and made them Italian Resraurant of the year one year. You don’t need to say any more than that. Well done OSO and when we’ve finished setting up our new business in KL we’ll be back in a flash."
Dying a slow death,"Oso used to be our go-to Italian restaurant in Singapore. The food and service used to be impeccable and the beautiful surrounds always made it a memorable occasion. However, I can't say the same after our experience last night. A party of 4, we were seated by 7pm. Menus were already placed at the table, however we were searching for service, searching for attention, searching for the love you expect in a restaurant like this. We ordered a bottle of wine, and a couple of whiskies. Wine was nice (but I mean they didn't make that), and the whiskies they failed to bring 'on the rocks' as per our order. We decided to opt for the 5 course degustation, and this was the beginning of a slow death for Oso. To start we had salmon pate - okay, just okay. No flavours, nothing I could really comment on. The waiter couldn't even tell us clearly what it was. Then came a pasta. An angel hair truffle pasta. All lumped together, and without much substance. The flavour of truffle was the only saving grace. The fish course next was SO FISHY. Felt like the fish had been sitting in their freezer for over 2 weeks, and together with a steamed piece of broccoli and 2 tomatoes, that was it. No sauce, nothing that popped. Felt like dead food. The meat course - lamb chops, again felt lacklustre. Nothing to dress it up and zero flavour, thought, effort...It was literally a pair of grilled lambchops, lucky the chops were from NZ! And lastly, a pathetic chocolate cake smothered in chocolate sauce. It was measly, and felt like a dessert you'd get on an aeroplane. An absolutely disappointing meal for a restaurant I used to think very highly of. Service didn't exist and the chef gave the produce no love, no flavour, nothing. To top it all off, they charged us twice. My friend received two text messages, saying payments had been deducted. When he went to question the wait staff, they said oops yeah, but they could have had the courtesy to come to us and let us know rather than us having to approach them. When you spend over $150 per head, you expect a sauce. Lucky the company I was with saved the evening!"
Service is key!,"I decided to surprise my husband by taking him to Oso for his birthday celebration dinner. It is close to where we live so a nice stroll there and we were there! We were seated at a table for 2 which I have to say was incredibly small - by the time the bread was on the table and our wine glasses and our entree of Burrata came - we were juggling things around the table to try and make them fit. Interestingly enough the table next to us for 2 people was twice the size of our table so we were a little miffed!
Ok so you know when you go to a restaurant and a waiter comes to your table and introduces themselves to you and says ""I'l be your waiter for this evening""? Well I really miss that! We had no clue as to who was our waiter and in fact we just tried to grab whomever we could. This was also exhibited in the fact that our empty plates sat in front of us until we finally got someone's attention. Now there were some pluses. I think the atmosphere is lovely and there was a saxophonist playing some jazz music in the background. The wine we had was lovely, although pricey but typically expected in Singapore. Our food was tasty, Burrata to start, then my husband had the Sea Bass and I had the Lamb followed by Gelato for hubby and Tiramisu for me. I am a BIG Tiramisu fan and this one was delicious!
So in summary, food was good and atmosphere was nice but the size of the table and the key criteria being service was a let down."
Magnifico lunch,"Found this place on top of the hotel during one of my stays. My impression was already then excellent, had now the opportunity to also go there with my wife during a stopover in Singapore to enjoy a long relaxing lunch.

We had starter, soup and pasta dishes to share with a pork belly and rib eye as main. All increasingly tasty paired with wine by the glass by the excellent accommodating staff.

After a couple of hours in heaven did we leave with lovely memories for this stopover

GO THERE!"
Over the Zenith! Gone from excellent to poor.,"We have been going regularly to Oso and that in all three locations it operated in the past. What a gem of a restaurant this was. Alas, no longer. Now housed in the hotel Oasia it features an attractive interior with warm lighting. Unfortunately it is located on the floor where the swimming pool is located which results in people in swimsuits running around outside the restaurant. In the end what makes a good restaurant is service and the quality of food. The former has remained good, but the choice and quality of food has sharply declined. There is only a choice of four dishes for each - entrees, salads, main course. Too limited for an Italian Restaurant. The bred looked and tasted like some type of biscuit rather than oven baked, crusty Italian bred. The vegetable, broccoli in my case came out of the water and had no taste. The pasta was equally tasteless. There is no more love, care and professionalism in the kitchen. At this rate the restaurant will not survive."
Unusual setting but great food,"We were on a short transit through Singapore and some friends suggested dinner here. It is on the top floor of the Oasia hotel, next to the swimming pool, which lent a certain ambience.
The service was excellent and our various menu selections wre all very good
I would certainly return if future travel includes a stay in Singapore"
SO- Only For Those Who Don’t Know Any Better,"We visited OSO to celebrate several new milestones in our lives, including a birthday. Calling ahead to make the reservation, we made doubly sure to indicate that we were celebrating a birthday, and asked the restaurant to make an arrangement for a surprise celebration.

Unfortunately, this was to be a night of surprises, none of them of our choosing.

The Service was poor and inattentive. The Service Member at the main door was busy on his mobile phone, and moved so quickly to our table that we actually lost him for awhile, Even as we were being seated, we felt rushed, and less than welcome, with the service staff asking why we were taking so long.

The Food lacked sophistication and care. For the prices, most of the dishes were unforgiveably forgettable. There was the bare minimum of attention to flavor, and the plating reminded me IKEA or a school cafeteria. The most unforgettable dish was dessert, a breakfast oatmeal serviced with diluted condensed milk.

Even the Wines failed to mirror the standards of the food, offering new lows from which the evening would never recover from. Save your expectations from being unrealised and just stick to the warm water.

Hoping against hope, that there would be one last act of redemption in the form of some birthday treat, we were to be absolutely let down by the lack of even a scoop of ice cream or a simple slice of cake.

As we were getting ready to leave the restaurant, we saw what must have been the most poignant clue of what we should have expected: at the prime place of importance at their entrance is a spotless and gleaming “The Very First All-Chrome Meat Slicer In The World - OSO Singapore”

When a restaurant’s claim to fame is its Kitchen Equipment, and not its Kitchen nor its Service, you cannot but wonder what else they have got wrong."
Absolutely Terrible and Most Disappointing,"We used to love Oso! Their service was always outstanding and we also have booked a private room here a while ago to celebrate a special occasion. But I didn’t have the chance to try it after it moved to the Oasia Hotel and was missing their food.

I took a really close Friend and client who was in town for a day and guaranteed him phenomenal food and service at Oso.

My decision soon turned out to be the worst ever!

My server couldn’t recommend whether or not to go for the set or a la carte as vegetarians. Losing patience as it was 14:00 hours and we were hungry, we decided to go for the a la carte.

We ordered a burrata, a spinach salad, risotto and an aglio olio. The burrata was decent and quite a decent size. But the rest of the good was the worst I’ve had. Every single dish had a weird smell in it. As soon as I mentioned this the first time to the server when the salad came in, he wasn’t bothered at all!

I hoped it was a one off dish. But the risotto was stinking and the pasta too! I couldn’t bear the smell of the risotto and didn’t touch it. I even asked another server to charge us completely but at least look into it. But he wasn’t bothered at all either. The lousiest and most arrogant service, topped with the worst food I’ve had!

If you’re a vegetarian, I would advice you to not enter this place. They are downright disrespectful"
Fine Italian Dining,"Sunday evening dinner in a lovely rooftop restaurant, greeted by swimming pools and views of the city. Restaurant ambience was warm and cosy, (reminded me of Italy), with a unique cheese cellar room within view and a long elegant bar. We had a few of the special (in season) white truffle dishes, followed by a 1.5kg Rib Eye steak (shared by 4 people) and sea bass, and a lovely cheese platter to finish the meal. All the food and wine were excellent; Chef Diego was a friendly, engaging presence throughout the meal. However, there seemed to be only a few waiters, and service seemed reactive and ""rushed"" (although it was adequately efficient). Cost per person was not excessive, considering the quality of food and wine.Overall - a most enjoyable evening !"
Jayco Trip,"Excellent food and service the lobster fettuccine and crab angle hair pasta dishes where excellent! We had meat tray which was very tasty all the meats were freshly cut and cheese plate came with tomatoes too very pleasing. The fish soup and mushroom were large portions and excellent. Also the desserts white chocolate orange cake and the dark chocolate tart was very fresh and tasty. Our other friends had chocolate ice cream which was fresh and hand made.
I would come here again!!!"
Great food Great night Great everything,"Excellent quality of wonderfully authentic Italian food and amazing wine selection. Staff were phenomenal, friendly and helpful. If you want great food, great location and great atmosphere then come and enjoy it. Sit back and relax and talk and enjoy."
Very mediocre meal,"Visited here as a family member had bought us a gift experience. The food was very basic, despite her paying quite a bit for the meal. It was obvious that the restaurant profitted a great deal. We had quinoa for starters, very thin spaghetti noodles cooked in butter with a sprinkling of black truffle for the pasta dish. Mains consisted of a small piece of pork belly, which to be fair was cooked beautifully, ( my hubby did remind me this is one of the cheapest pieces of meat after chicken that a reatuarant could serve) with a few undercooked boiled potatoes, some peppers and a sprig of rosemary. There was hardly any sauce/jus and the meal just seemed incomplete and did not seem well thought out. Dessert was a minute flan covered in a strawberry sauce. In fact, I have never had such a tasteless, poor dessert at an Italian restaurant before. None of the food impressed us and as they failed to even offer one dish which aimed to wow the customer with its taste, we would not return, there are too many other top class Italian restuarants in Singapore, Braci being one example."
What a disappointment !,"This place (I don't call it restaurant) was highly recommended by a friend and we booked a table on short notice as we had to celebrate something. We were happy about this - especially on a weekend. Happiness was gone very fast when the first food arrived after more than hour for some basic starter (other tables were served already despite being there after us). The quality was really poor, starting from the dry Blinis for the Caviar, the so called potato soup (disgusting) or a basic (parsley) carpaccio was of terrible taste. We didn't complain, but it was obvious that we were not happy with the food. My wife didn't touch the soup anymore after tasting and nobody even asked if something is wrong with it. When we left the restaurant the soup was still on our table. The main course was even worse. We ordered Tenderloin Beef for the kids - medium well as usual, but the meat arrived already in a lake of blood on the plate. We asked them to correct this and it was not at all welcomed by the waiter. My Cod was ok isch. Nobody served us anymore and I finally asked for the bill (many times) which was given to us without asking how the food was etc. We still had our plates on the table, no dessert offered and in the end we were extremely disappointed about the food, the service and the attitude. It is one of those places where you spend so much money and get nothing in return. Stay away from this place !"
BDay celebration,"We last visited OSO @their old venue and this is our 1st trip to the new restaurant.
Ambience is beautiful and staff hospitality were excellent.
Food quality / standard is always above par. The only glitch is the loud noise from 1 lady diner @neighboring table which became unbearable after 1hour.
Was totally UNCOUTH of her dining @a fine dine restaurant..."
Fantastic service and great food,"We had a terrific evening at OSO, a proper grown up restaurant at the top of the Oasia hotel. A warm greeting from the front of house manager, a great wine selection from our waiter, delicious fresh pasta with lobster, tasty Milanese and a great cheese board. Thoroughly recommended"
