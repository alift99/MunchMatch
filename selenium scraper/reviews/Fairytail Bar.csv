Yuck,"We must have been there on an off night for the chef. The food here did not meet the expectation or the previous visitor ratings. The food itself was bland and undercooked. The side vegetables were cold as ice. Could not even finish my meal. The place was boiling, seemed the AC unit was not functional. Just an overall very bad experience both with the food and the ambiance."

Good ambience,Fairytale Bar doesn‚Äôt disappoint with the spectacular view and drinks concoction. Diners have a choice between indoor and outdoor dining as well. Servers are attentive and friendly while still providing diners with some privacy.
Bday celebration for partner,Food was nice & served on time.. First time coming to this plce for a special occasion.. price is affordable with perks & table setup for the occasion was perfect.. recommended to those who wished to celebrate any special occasion here.. all the staffs were very friendly and accomodating & customer service was tip top.. thumbs up.. will come to this plce again for other occasion
"great views and staff, no alcohol, terrible french food","Good rooftop bar for night view, if you do not seat near the kitchen exhausts. No alcohol served and very average Italian and French 'inspired' food. Avoid the duck confit (not confit and very dry) and the foie gras (inedible and served without toasts but dried out garlic bread rather) at all cost. Staff helpful and polite throughout."
Good food with city view,"Come here for good food, service and view! Brownie (points) if its your birthday month üòâ but seriously, ambience is great for a chill celebration or casual dinner."
First and Last time,"First of all. There is super little parking there! Came on a friday night. Basement had a lot available but it was indicated as a private carpark. Tried the carpark across the street and it was full. Thats it. No where else to park. At this point hubby dropped me off first whilst he try to find parking. He round for 20 mins and ended up just parking at the private basement anyway and the waitress said if we‚Äôre not there for too long it should be fine..

We were seated indoors despite having made a reservation with a special occasion indicated (Anniversary). However no effort done by them to help commemorate the event. Like why have an indication on the website if ure not gonna do anything abt it,right??? (Like free drink or cake at the very least).

On to the food. Had the ribeye. Asked for medium. It was burnt on the outside and unevenly cooked on the inside. Some parts medium, medium rare and well done. The marinade did not taste good as well. A good steak will taste good even without additional sauces to supplement it. To top it off they served it with FRIES dude so wrong. Steak should be mashed potatoes or at least give an option for it. Annnnd the salad can cry. It. Was. Not. Fresh. Like some of the green seem wilted (slaps forehead)

Hubby had the lamb. It was dry and so hard to cut off. And omg mashed Really disappointing. Sides with baby potatoes(hard) and mashed potatoes(dry!!!!). The fact that they dan screw up mashed potatoes is really something. Never before have i come across badly done mashed potatoes in any establishment. Guess theres a first time for everything.

Daughter had spaghetti aglio olio. The spaghetti was cooked abit on the hard side. Tooo much bite to it. It should be al dente. However, taste is good as aglio olio should be.

Drinks tasted good though. Apple juice and some drink that came in a really kiddy looking bottle (rolls eyes). They really need to change that. Dont like that it came in a reusable bottle everyone who orders that has used. I mean cmon!!!!! Yucks.

So yeah super disappointing night. First and last time coming here. Mb the ambience cldve been better if we were 2 pll knky and seated outside. But thats it. Food still needs to be greatly improved anyway. Night still would not be saved."
Celebrate anniversary,Great atmosphere here with nice view. They have indoor & outdoor dining. Food is so gooodddddd. Staff with service excellent. Very impressed.
Excellent Service,"My first time at Fairytale, was attended by Mr Iman. Great service, food and ambiance. Book early for an outdoor rooftop romantic setting. Tried the Gambari spaghetti, you won't regret it! Overall the place is awesome."
Great Place to Chill,A good place chill and dine with great food to accompany. Interesting drink menu and food to boot. Highly recommended!!!
SUPERB service,"Love how the servers are very engaging and friendly. Frequently check on us and the food. Love the mocktail i ordered which was crafted by Zatil.

Iman was super friendly and lovely. If you get him as your serve please be nice he is lovely.

Hisham was the first person we see when we arrived, we guided us to the seat and offered us options on where to seat.

The food is .
Beyond my expectations. I tried the chef's special which lamb steak & lamb shoulder. The meat was tender and well done. The mash potato flavouring is just wow. And the portion.. if you're not a big eater please share or dont eat anything before coming.

Thankyou guys! Our first experience here is awesome!"
"Nice View, Friendly Staff",Good service. Friendly staff. Especially Iman. He was very warm and welcoming. Had the Pandan cocktail with the owl cup. interestong taste.
1st time here,"Food is great, service staff is friendly. Good atmosphere for dining out watching the sunset with your love ones."
Excellent customer service,"Food is delicious, prefect view . Customer service is good ! Staff were super friendly . Definitely will come back again with my boyfriend"
Roof-top Halal Restaurant,"Nice place to chill out after a long day of work. Roof top Halal places aren't that many in Singapore so it is absolutely a Perfect idea! There was a tiny shot welcome drink - nice gesture

However, I wouldn't say the same for the food, chicken wings were not cooked well inside and they were yummy with the sauce in the outer layer, yes. There was cheese on particularly everything we ordered even as a garnish to the chicken wings, which was a terrible idea. We informed for the cheese/sauce on the truffle fries to be on the side, but it was not fulfilled unfortunately

The ordering system felt more like online shopping, where you have to add to cart and pay upon submitting the order. Obviously, I was not a fan of it, as it will was difficult to change the order/remove something from the menu.
I do like pistachios, however it was way too much of pistachios in 3 desserts, hope that can be changed.
Get creative with your ending guys and be consistent with the straw (metal are the best). We need to do our part for our planet.

I am glad, they were open to suggestions and did mention the above during our visit."
Okay food but pricey,"Came here for my partner‚Äôs belated birthday dinner. Walked in at 5.30pm and chose the outdoor seating which was nice and even nicer when the sun starts to set and the lights were switched on.

Personally the food we ordered (Gambari Aglio Olio, Duck Carbonara and Truffle Fries) was just okay and the price was quite steep, especially the drinks. Will try out something else or the High Tea Menu if I come again.

Service from staff was excellent. There was Irsyad (if I remembered correctly) and another gentleman. They‚Äôve been great and checked up on us.

Overall, although the food is not up to par with the price, it‚Äôs a nice ambience to probably celebrate a special occasion. More so, there‚Äôs not much Halal restaurants with a view like this."
Birthday Visit,Customer service is 101/100 Food is of great quality Came here for a Birthday of my Fiancee and was served well
Beauty and the Beast,"Extremely friendly staff with a great welcoming atmosphere. The food, drinks and dessert are beautifully presented and taste wonderful."
F&B,Nice and cosy place to dine in. Love the open view. The food are great. Love the bubblegum ice cream and dessert. So yummy. Highly recommended.
Love the food and atmosphere,"Came here with my friends ,all my friends and myself love the atmosphere and the food! Although its covid and we can‚Äôt sit together but it‚Äôs fine."
1st Anniversary,"Friendly and cheerful service. Love the ambient. Choices of food, dessert & drinks is superb. Highly recommended üëå"
An underrated hidden gastrobar,"Pros: Nice ambience, great food and excellent customer service. The servers, Ash , Shah and Matt kept checking on us to see if they could serve us further.

Cons: Not really a con but It‚Äôs a little quite, would suggest for them to have a little music played in the background. Location was a little off as well but we drove so no problem as there is a public car park opposite the hotel.

Above all, would come back!!"
Great Experience!,"The service is amazing, loved the vibe and the food is shiok. Would come again and 100% recommend! The staffs are really friendly too!"
A Fairytail come true!,"As The Wanderlost Lounge recommended by my daughters was closed, I chose this place for dinner on the occasion of my birthday, for the first time, as it was in the same chain. Menu had items from Italian and French cuisines and, more interestingly, a variety of mocktails with catchy bird names. Perched atop D‚ÄôHotel, it proved a cosy cool place for our dinner. The mocktail was an experience itself - I got to add an ingredient to make the refreshing concoction. Our special meal requests were carefully handled and selection of alternatives demonstrated thoughtfulness, resulting in the whole presentation being a feast for the eyes. While we thought it to be already a nice gesture to get a brownie with ice-cream for my birthday celebration, we were moved when Ash launched into a set of warm wishes for me and, with our approval, went on to sing a beautiful birthday song for me. And I also got a handmade birthday card from the Fairytail team with our photo. An unforgettable milestone birthday celebration for me. Well done!
Thank you Ash, Matt and Murni for creating a beautiful memory."
Great Experience:),Splendid ambience and view. Great customer service and food was amazing too. Would definitely be back to try their lepak menu!

Birthday and Anniversary celebration,"I love the service at this place. Everyone was so attentive, polite and courteous. Such a lovely quant place to hang out and chill with your family and friends. Food was delightful too .. I would highly recommend my Muslim and non Muslim friends to give this place a go! Job well done"
Should be a memorable night became a horrible night. Thank you!,"Had made reservation on the 28th August and indicate celebrating my partner birthday. Upon arriving was abit dissapointed that we were given indoor seat and the excuse was outdoor seating was make by reservation and i the want who make the reservation in advance and hearing that type of excuse its really unacceptable.

So in 5 mins time they approach and say they will be moving us to outdoor. Its a plus point as the staff is being pro active.

So we were given outdoor seat really directly infront of the exit door. For this i really have to feedback for safety reason as exit door should not have any obsticle to be blocking the entrance. As that is a fire exit route.

The drinks and dessert will be recommended as that is a plus point. For the food is really dissapointing. The food is really salty we order for starter is the crab cake it was damnnnnn i dont know how much salt was added but what to do we force ourself to eat it and dunk it with chilli sauce due to what we paid for it not gonna waste it. Ok so we tot the main dish will be syiok but it added to our dissapointment. My partner ate the gambari aglio olio and she commented to me the pasta did not cook well as it is uneven. For my self i had lamb shank i asked for medium rare indeed its for 2 of the lamb is cooked the last lamb it was burn on the outside and it was damn raw on the inside. The Ratatouille and mash potato was damn salty including the lamb shank so to this extend when i found out the lamb was raw i had to give feedback immediately to the staff as i had enough of the dissapointment moment as it really ruin my day and i pity my partner as it should be a romantic and memorable birthday dinner!

The only plus point is your ground staff is really proactive as they gave ice cream as apology of course la i wasted money but what to do just swallow la. The disadvantage here is you have to pay first through online before they can get your order so you wont get discount or refund forget about asking bout it also.

What a night a disaster night. Im sorry but we leave with dissapointment. I guess the overall is just for insta photo and just the outlook looks nice. Damnnnn. The first and the last as it was a special moment being ruin. Not trying to be rude commenting but this is a honest review. Thanks really thanks alot la."
