Stingy laksa,"I should have stick to their bak kut teh instead. However, thinking i try something different, i ordered their laksa. Really stingy, only half a egg and a few taopok. They don't even bean sprouts or fish cake. geez."
Nice Restaurant For A Decent Meal,Don’t be misled with the name of the restaurant as it serves lots of local dishes besides bak kut teh.Their signature dishes are bak kut teh with mee sua and bak kut teh yong tau foo.The meats are tender and yummy. However some of us found the soup too peppery and spicy. The Laksa was very authentic and delicious. Food and drink prices are very reasonable and food portions relatively big. Good value for the money spent
You won’t go over the moon even if you’re spoon-fed by Mr. Koon,Too many items on the menu come at a price: the bak kut teh just isn’t very good. The so-called chicken rice which costs $1 per bowl has no flavour of chicken. No free water. Wonder if many customers come here to play e-dart.
Great tasting Bak Kut Teh,"I don't know much about how bak kut teh should taste like, but we compare this to Legendary Bak Kut Teh and Koon is the winner in our oppinion. Tender and tasty ribs. And the other dishes were to really great. Both in presentation and service.
Happy hour Tiger beer was extra bonus.
I would have returned to this place to try their premium bak kut teh as well if we had more time, as their standard was more than just good!"
Can do !,"Clean and air conditioned . Service is quick and friendly. Food is delicious , piping hot and value for money . Quite a variety on menu besides pork rib soup !"
Unexpected place to serve BKT,"The food is moderately okay. The soup is a little too oily. The saving grace is the generous and tender meat served. It’s a bistro, so expect music and sounds from the dart machine."
Nice but not brilliant.,"The service was ok if you can ignore the sniffing. The lunch was not spectacular and despite and old newspaper review, we expected better. Clearly a family run business which appears to have seen better imes. Maybe it is a generational change. We visited after a walk through the reserve."
Good review,Excellent service. They are ready to serve us. Food was nice and affordable. A nice place to visit again
Good food,"Good food, come here frequently. Fast and efficient service. The waiter and waitresses here are friendly"
One of the must come places in Singapore,"This is a real east meet west venue. Beer is @ Sin$15 for two glasses during happy hours, and you can have chicken feet or chicken wings to wash it down. The famous Bah Kut Teh ( traditional herbal pork rib soup) plus other local food cooked at a high standard are at your disposal.
The service is immaculate, and all the service staff speak good English.
Ambience is unique, and the background music is soft and well chosen.
Highly recommended for a easy evening out with good food, good beer and value for money."
Good food,"Food was great, I would rate the bak kut teh as the best here. I came with friends and tried out few different dishes. But the Bak Kut Teh was the most outstanding one out of all. The pork knuckle is another dish that I recommend. The meat is tender and soft and well seasoned. Overall great experience at Koon Bak Kut Teh"
Good supper place,"Drinks came promptly. White seafood noodle with salted egg yolk came piping hot and tasted satisfying. 2 large prAwns, many clams. Will be back to try the bak kut the which many were having"
Yummy Bak kut teh,"Yummy food! Good soup base not too peppery. Generous free flow of soup. We had salted vegetable, beancurd skin n braised pork. All good!"
Good BKT during rainy season,Delicious BKT and side dishes with friendly & efficient service! Recommend the bean curd skin and braised meat. Soup is tasty and peppery not the herbal kind. Pricing quite reasonable but parking can be challenging. Will be back again
Food was nice,The food here was nice. Sibei good. Nearby my house too. The food here was quite cheap too. Totally worth it.
Hehexd,"Food was pretty good. We had the standard bak kut teh which was fragrant and tender. The pork trotters we had was quite delightful. However, comparing the amount and the price, i feel that part could be improved as it wasnt really enough for us to be full"

Good service,Second visit and they serve Good food. The pork is very tender. Comfortable place for lunch. I like it
Local delicacies,"Ordered white seafood bee hoon n Kong Bak (Braised Chinese Pork). Bee Hoon was ok but as the braised pork was cut into small pieces for cooking, it dries up the meat but the fat is melting in your mouth though. So I would give it a mixed 4 star. Surprisingly ice lemon tea was prepared and made in the shop!"
Tasty white bee hoon,"White bee hoon in tasty broth. Bak ku teh is nice especially on a cold night. Service is good too. They also serve normal double boiled soup for those, especially kids who can't take spice or pepper."
