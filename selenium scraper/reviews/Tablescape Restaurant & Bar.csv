Tablescape,"Super good service, friendly staff and good food. Would come again. Awesome restaurant, great experience"
Dining,The staff are all courteous and Mr Rico handed and made us come cappuccino. The room was very so beautiful and relaxing.
Impressive service,"We went to Tablescape for breakfast and greeted by Mei warmly despite of the busy crowd. She ushered us to our seat with a smile on her face.
We were then served by Rico which pays attention to detail as our daughter is very picky on food. He attends to our needs as we also have a young boy that keeps playing around.
The chefs are very accommodating to our request and thanks to Lai Yong, Kok Wah & Jaden for attending to the dietary that we have. We really appreciate them as chef Lai Yong even walk out to check if all is good.
The team is really an asset to the place and their service is really impressive. We will certainly come back and recommend the hotel to our family and friends.
Thank you so much for the warmth hospitality!"

"Compliment to Rico, Mei and Chef Lai Yong and the whole team","I am pleased with the service of Rico and Mei because they are very friendly and accomodating. They have attended to us in a professional manner. They are very efficient and effective on their job responsibilities. I am so happy with the service of the whole team.

Breakfast at Tablescapes,Mei and Rico of Tablescapes Restaurant and Bar in Grand Park City Hall provided the best service ever! Will definitely recommend to this place to my friends.
A great dining experience and more on Chinese New Year’s Eve.,"This is my second time back to Tablescape, on Chinese New Year’s Eve! Once again, the staff did not disappoint with great service and fantastic food.

The soup was my favourite while the asparagus with scallop sprinkled with almonds left me wanting more. The truffle duck was another highlight but the dinner was elevated from great to superb when we had the Lo Hei with salmon and caviar! My kids enjoyed the mango passion fruit juice and the adults took the gin and strawberry cocktails to wind down the dinner.

The team took such good care of us that I took their names down - Mei, David, Rico, Nisha, Farah were so attentive and went the extra mile to serve us coffee on the house with hot froth milk to pour on as desired. One of my girls did not like the dessert I ordered and the staff served her ice cream to make her day!

As we were seated in a secluded corner, the ambience was right on spot and we enjoyed lots of photo taking. Our first CNY dinner in a hotel after Covid and Tablescape helped made this evening memorable."
Chinese New Year Eve Dinner,"My family have a reservation for CNY Eve reunion dinner there.

The table setting for 19 of us is very nice, we were very well served by Mei, David, Rico, Nisha and Farah.
Staff are all very attentive and adds in the joy when we did our Lo Hei. We also had some juices, mocktails and cocktails from the bar during dinner, very refreshing drinks and delicious meal.
Thank you for such memorable reunion dinner there as we usually have steamboat at home…"
Having a wholesome dinner at Tablescape Restaurant,"Serviced staffs, Farah and Nisha were very warm and efficient. I feel very welcomed at the restaurant. I love the nasi goreng. It’s delicious and the serving is very generous!"
Fantastic,Stayed here for the first time. Hotel was clean and helped us a numerous time. Want to thank a wonderful lady named Wendy that looked after us so well during our stay she was very kind.
Tablescape charged double!,I had a nice dinner in Tablescape on new year eve. The foods were amazing and we were nicely taken care by the server. The only problem was i feel like hotel was trying to scam people. I was billed $208++ per person for new year dinner while on internet clearly stated $108++ per person. Please be honest and mention the correct price on the internet. I was totally upset by the management marketing style by cheating customer :(
Not good anymore,"We liked the place before Covid, but is a true disappointment now. Some courses on the food were good, other not so good. Wine list has probably a dozen of selections, of which (3!) are available. We were the only diners in the evening."
Tablescape lunch,"Was here for lunch, served by nisha excellent service, friendly and cheerful, can’t wait to meet nisha and the tablescape team again! :)"
Lobby Bar for F1,"The bar and staff was top notch very kind and friendly. Nisha Tablescapesg team crushed it, she came recommended and did an outstanding job!"
F1 Race @ Grand Park City Hall,Great food and service at the rooftop! Nisha brought us under cover in lobby for wet weather! Highly recommend the tablescape team.
Afternoon Tea,"Great service, patient and polite. Will visit again really soon! Recommended to everyone. @tablescapesg @nisha @mei"
Afternoon high tea for 2,Staffs are very helpful and hospitable when attending to us. Great attitude! High tea treats are filling so it’s best to come with an empty stomach to better savour them 😋 @tablescapesg_ @nisha @mei
Afternoon High Tea,The staffs are attentive and friendly. The food is also freshly prepared and served. It’s an overall good experience. _@tablescapesg @nisha @Mei
"Awesome farewell, welcome and birthday event",Totally awed by the Tablescape team for the impeccable service! Esp Nisha who attended to us so attentively!
Not recommend,We was the only customer dining at the time but the staff was not attentive enough and they take quite long to serve the food and it taste average.
Average selection,Staff - friendly and professional Ambience - love the renovated decor Food - nothing to exciting Drinks - standard offering
Good food plus trustworthy staff,"It was our first time to try their set lunch and we were not disappointed. I’d like to take this opportunity to commend Kubeindran and Rico for finding my bracelet, which I dropped at the restaurant. Thank you very much!"
National Day Celebration at Grandpark City Hotel,"We were watching fireworks and enjoying the bbq, the food was amazing and it was a memorable moment. The service by Nisha was really good <3 The DIY cocktails were a nice touch too and the games section was quite fun!"
Dinner night :D,"Nisha, mei, David has provided a very pleasant experience here at tablescape bar and restaurant. Their service has been wonderful."
Afternoon tea,Food is great! Service is impeccable! Ambience is awesome! Overall a very nice and cosy experience! Definitely worth visiting again! :) thank you Tablescape team! :)
The place did not exist,The whole building was undergoing renovation. There was no sign of a proper entrance to the building or the restaurant.
Afternoon Tea,Good variety of small bites accompanied with assorted tea and coffee selections. Especially love the sweet sections :) Great ambience and friendly staff as well. Thank you!
Hi Tea at Tablescape,The hi tea selection is good with savoury n sweet delights. Service is excellent. We enjoyed ourselves very much!
Tea Bonding Session,Was with my wife and it is something that we can relate to everytime when we think of tea time now. Thanks for the experience. Cheers!!
Excellent location for Tea,There’s privacy in the area as there isn’t much people for business talks over tea. Price is also reasonable at $78 serves 2. Staffs are also attentive to us
Birthday celebration,"Good customer service, their high tea value for money. Worth trying and will recommend friends to visit."
Friends,Tasty high tea set with friends. Very convenient venue from town. Good service from Steve and the staffs there
High tea,"High tea was not bad, just that scones were not heated up. But value for money. Service was prompt with refilling of tea as well"
Lunch @ Tablescape,"Only plus point at Tablescape is good service. Apart from that, everything else is mediocre - average ambience and average food at above average prices. Not sure if it's because the restaurant is operating at lower than usual capacity - but hope the review helps with improving things!"
Great lunch time dining experience,Had the set lunch which was excellent value. Food was delicious and well executed. Our smoked duck starter was refreshingly light on the palate. The mains we chose (pork roulade) was very generous. Loved the champagne gel dessert. Service was friendly and attentive and a big shout out to Rico for making our dining experience a most enjoyable one!
Date with friend,"The environment is very nice . Is my prefer place to enjoy my hi tea. Their food is delicious, exspically chocolate puff is my favourite .it is good place to hi tea with friend or business."
Lunar New Year Afternoon Tea Home Delivery,"It was the best high tea that we have had so far in Singapore. It was sublime. It had the right balance of sweet and savoury items. The truffle egg mayo tortilla with chicken floss and ham, beetroot cup, beetroot salad and creme cheese were amazing. The mandarin orange mousse tart was out of the world. Greatly enjoyed ourselves."
Halloween Afternoon High Tea Set Delivery,Saw good reviews online and decided to order for my mum's birthday. Prompt delivery b4 3pm and yummyilious food. Family enjoyed it very much!
Fine Dinning but not enough.,"Decoration was simple and plain, food was alright, no complains, complimentary bread was good, Staff was polite, My only comment is the food seems too fine and little thus seems a little overpriced."
"Top notch service, attention to detail by Chef and most comfy baby chairs!","Discovered this underrated gem of a place at city hall.. Tucked away in the 3rd floor of the Grand Park City Hall hotel, this underrated gem of a place deserves more mention. Despite running the show with just 2 wait staff that day, they managed to make arrangements for my elderly father on wheelchair, and the most comfortable baby seat ever at an F&B! We were there to celebrate my mother's birthday and she was pleasantly surprised by the softness of the grilled chicken... my father was elated by how tender and rich the beef cheek tasted.. and i am bowled over by the black truffle fettucine. The chef later on brought out a special dessert plating to surprise my mum. They are also okay with helping you keep a cafe in the fridge..
And did i mention dining at this restaurant gives you complimentary 3hr carpark coupon even!!!
Definitely a place suitable for dates and special occasions,"
Cozy ambience and welcome food,"I love that it is a quiet and intimate place for gatherings, away from the hustle of the busy city. Celebrated my birthday in this place for dinner. Chef Ethan came to our table and asked about the dining experience, a nice gesture indeed! amazing food and welcoming team, thank you for the memorable experience! will surely come back!"
Food presentation looks good.,Food presentation looks good. That's all that is good. But portions has shrunk over the months. Bread has changed from the usual. The beef cheek was bland. The also changed what can be used for entertainer.
Excellent service,"Used Entertainer 1 for 1. Ordered Chicken and Beef main. The food was decent but the service was excellent. Waitress, Elisa, could explain all the ingredients of the food and was readily available when we required her help. Was even given a free cake for my girlfriend birthday. Elisa sang birthday song and took pictures for us. Would definitely return for the service."
Afternoon Tea with babies,I love the quiet place of this restaurant for afternoon tea as it is not crowded at all. Suitable for mummies with young babies from 1 month old onwards. The item for the afternoon tea is very delicious too and pescetarian option is available too.
Lunch with friends,"We walk in on a sat lunch and luckily not crowded. We are seated by restaurant manager and Rico took our order. I had lunch with 2 friends and we ordered the squid ink pasta, seabass, angus beef cheek and champagne jelly. We are served 2servings of bread. In each serving there are 4pcs of bread. It was warm, crisp soft and nice. I would strongly recommend the angus beef cheek it is super soft and melt in your mouth kind. Champagne jelly is special, light and yummy for the not so sweet tooth lover. Champagne taste is mild i would love it to be stronger. Overall experience is good. Price alittle ex but worth the dollar. Strongly recommended."
Quality food and good service,The restaurant has excellent service and a nice atmosphere. The iberico pork dish is great! They even provided a small complimentary starter dish.
Wouldn’t recommend,"Bad service, staff communicated wrong information despite emailing and a follow up call to confirm. Very disappointed."
Breakfast & HighTea Experience,"Had 3 days of amazing experience at the Club lounge for our breakfast & Hightea Session. Love how Ms Tiffany(the one who attended to us the entire time), the chef and the team members as they were very polite and attentive.

The food was good but the experience and service were amazing! They made our last few days of the year a great one! Once again, thank you to Ms Tiffany and the team for the experience and the food served! ✨"
Had two extremes of experience,"Had two extremes of experience at the Club lounge. After checking in, we had a wonderful high tea, food was good but the experience and service were great. This brought us back to wanting to do breakfast at the lounge again, wishing to have a great start of a new day. The server was cold in serving, perhaps she had a bad day. Not a nice way to start our day sadly. Despite asking for the breakfast to be slowed down, each item came nearly fast & furious."
Poof quality Christmas lunch menu,"Really poor quality food at around $80++ per person, quantity over quality, from appetizer to dessert. Chicken, fish and lamb all were very poor quality with no taste. Hardly ate anything and will never return again."
Overall experience,"Can better manage the overall F&B operations and logistic. The food took quite some time to come, >45mins."
Wait Staff Need to be Educated about Dietary Needs,"I just had a bit of a horrifying experience. The food was well-cooked and well-presented, and it was tasty. The menu-writer had taken pains to highlight which foods were gluten-free. But what is incomprehensible to me is -- after explaining very clearly to the waiter that I had to eat gluten-free -- another waiter then plonked down in front of me the amuse bouche (which I hadn't ordered) -- it was a sliver of foie gras on a suspicious-looking biscuit. So I asked if the biscuit was gluten-free, and the waiter insisted that it was. He was VERY insistent. Only after repeated questioning did he go back to the kitchen to check. And only after a stretch of time did he return (more than enough time for a customer to swallow a very inviting amuse bouche), and unapologetically (and rather curtly) informed me that I should not be eating the biscuit after all, because it was a shortbread and NOT at all gluten-free. I told him if I'd eaten it, it would have caused me all manner of problems -- and he did not seem in the least bit apologetic at having misled me in the first place. I am most appalled that he could have got something so basic so wrong. Not going back again -- the rest of the wait staff seemed OK, but this one guy was cavalier and unconcerned, which makes the intentions behind the whole menu with all its gluten-free and vegetarian symbols ring a bit hollow. So unpleasant; ruined a fine evening for me."
Tasty lunch at Tablescape,"I came here for lunch with a friend in December 2019. We didn't have a reservation and wanted to use the Entertainer app. Apparently the rules were that a reservation is needed if the Entertainer app is to be used (although nowhere on the app is this idiosyncratic rule made clear). After some negotiation we were allowed in (since anyway the restaurant wasn't busy as it was a week day lunchtime). Everything else went smoothly and the bread and main courses were very good. I would just recommend that, if the restaurant chooses to participate in a particular app, that it considers making rules such as this clear on the apps rather than informing the diners upon arrival. That would lead to a better all round experience for everyone."
Dinner at Tablescape,The service was really good and the food was yummy too!Especially loved the brioche bread and the egg dish!!
Dine & Wine,"1 of the places that I have been visiting when I need to recharge. Cosy atmosphere, contemporary style, friendly staffs that always put a smile whenever they greet you. The restaurant manager, Derrek, and his team are helpful and delicate to their jobs. Services are top notch and willing to explain if you have doubts in ordering foods or drinks. 2 thumbs up for Tablescape and their staffs!"
quality food choices,Our package had and include meal. There was a good range to choose from and the food itself was of a good standard.
Overall very nice experience,Went for my gf birthday celebration. We enjoy the food and service. Will come back again. Worth trying!
a cozy affair,"excellent service, spoilt for choice. chef came out to greet. dessert came out in a lovely pushcart to our table. bread and butter was served warm and fresh. warm and friendly service crew."
Hospitable Service and a Delightful Experience.,"Complimentary bread trolley was a great surprise as we enjoyed the bread so much, especially the potato bread! Food was good but service was even more remarkable. Manager and service team are very friendly and attentive which we really appreciate. Thank you for the good dining experience!"
Wonderful experience,My family enjoyed every aspect of what Tablescape had to offer - from the delicious food to their very welcoming/polite staff. They helped us celebrate my sister’s birthday with a complimentary chocolate cake. Thank you :)
Amazing food and service!,"We decided to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary at Tablescape and we had the most amazing experience at the restaurant and enjoying everything that Chef Armando created. Everything that he puts on the table was delightful to our eyes and our palates. Well done Chef and kudos to Tablescape staff who make our celebration even more memorable and beautiful!

Ps- Must try the iberico pork and probably won’t stop eating the bread...."
One of the better diners to be at,"It was a faultless service experience from Abel, Hafiq, and Jesmond, led by restaurant manager Derek who was SUPER professional, polite, and extremely welcoming. We noticed Derek’s excellent service displayed at every single table he approached - regardless couples or families, locals or tourists. I am impressed much (from a fellow hotelier).

Food - Wagyu was perfectly grilled to medium rare as requested. Lamb rack was best I ever had. Meat was tender and definitely delish, despite my request to have it well done. Mashed potato was smooth, creamy, and so tasty. Salmon had fantastically crisp skin but meat was teenie weenie bit fishy. Iberico pork chop was a little dry and bland. Bread basket was amazing - crispy warm bread that was soft on the inside.

Overall experience: 5 stars."
Absolutely delicious!,"My friends and I celebrated my birthday at Tablescape tonight. We ordered 4 mains and they were all delicious. My absolute favourite has to be the Pork Chop. So tender and flavourful! The lamb rack was a very close second, juicy and well seasoned.

Even the bread and halibut served before the mains were splendid. Besides the food, the wonderful staff made sure we were always well taken care of, always checking with us and topping up the water. A free cake was even given as a surprise.

My friends and I had a great night and I had quite the birthday dinner!"
Awesome!,Been to Tablescape Restaurant a few times. Their food and service are consistently good. Love their ribeye and lamb rack! Thank you Derrek and team for the attentive service and Chef Ethan for our wonderful meal. Highly recommended!
Hidden Gem in the Heart of the City,"Have been to Tablescape 6 times over the past 3 years, and the restaurant has consistently served excellent food with good customer service. Would highly recommend the Australian Wagyu Rump Steak, which was done to perfection and was soft and juicy. Tablescape also serves complimentary bread freshly baked from the oven, one of the best I have tasted. The team led by Derrek provided top notch customer service, and were friendly and attentive to our needs. Thanks to Haziq and Abel for serving for our table tonight."
Good for special occasions,"High-end restaurant at the Hotel at Grand park with a limited selection crafted by the Chef. Food was good but not too satisfying in terms of portion. Came here for a birthday celebration and service was excellent with the dessert table offered for a selection of extra sweets even though we had ala carte. The creme brûlée was the most memorable dish, perfectly caramelised!"
Fabulous food.,"We had two dinner meals at Tablescape Restaurant during our stay at the Grand Park Hotel City Hall. The food is freshly cooked and delicious. The restaurant has a nice quiet ambience and the staff are exceptional. Derek, who is Mr Personality Plus, made us feel special. He provided absolutely exceptional customer service to us and was so friendly and nice. We also met the chef Ethan and appreciate his skills in providing such great food. Highly recommended as a great place for a meal."
Wowed,"Was expecting a typical Valentine's day dinner. However I was pleasantly surprised by the offerings at Tablescape.
Compliments to Mr Derrek and his team members for their impeccable service and food served.
Bread was served warm and tasty. My gf thoroughly enjoyed her foie gras and the cod fish was just pan fried to perfection. Of course it ended on a sweet note with the dessert chef dishing out the Tiramisu.
Will definitely re visit again"
Found this little gem,Found this little gem of a restaurant whilst having a Sling in Raffles. Let Derek and his team provide you with excellent service and great food. The bread and other littles special things are great. The pork was the best I have had
5 stars hotel and restuarant with 5 star service,"We went to Singapore for an important business trip and stay at Grand Park City Hall. We didn't have much time for lunch since we need to leave for work so I booked Tablescape Restuarant and informed the restaurant staff in advance to manage to make the food and table ready for the Executive in such limited time. The staff have done it in such professional way; food, service, table arragementand everything. The food is also impressive. Thanks to all the staff. We had a great time."
Nice & Comfortable with Great Service,"It was my girlfriend birthday yesterday and we had an enjoyable moment here in tablescape.

The food here was good, and it got even more amazing with the super cozy, quiet environment.

One of best experiences here is with Haziq. I would like to thank Haziq for his hospitality & care. I were in F&B before and I know how precious to have a server like him that cares for people.

Therefore, I would highly recommend this restaurant to couples or people who love quiet dining place."
Hidden Gem at City Hall,"We are always spoilt for choice when it comes to eateries in the vicinity of City Hall around Stamford Road and North Bridge Road in Singapore. My wife and I chanced upon a gem on level 3 of the Grand Park City Hall named Tablescape. It is a small restaurant that serves modern European cuisine.

For starters, we had the pumpkin soup and the duck. The delicious soup was served with finesse and poured at our table while the duck was succulent and moist.

The delectable mains were a squid-ink pasta and a lovely fish which was cooked to perfection. We ended our meal with a Raspberry dessert. The most unforgettable was definitely the selection of bread that comes with a choice of salted or unsalted butter, perfectly quenelle.

We would like to convey our appreciation to Dimas and Derrek, for making our afternoon dining experience a memorable one. Typical of many small restaurants in Europe, Chef Armando Aristarco added the special touch of making his rounds to talk to the diners about his food and to ensure we are happy with our meals.

We look forward to going back to saviour the other selections on the menu."
Excellent service provided by Derrek,"Celebrated my friend’s bachelorette at tablescape. Would like to thank you Derrek for the great service he’d offered during our time there. Food was great, ambience was excellent and service by Derrek was amazing."
Top class food,The decor of this in-hotel restaurant is a bit bland but our lunch was extremely good. They have a Josper oven which means that they cook particularly delicious meat. And it's worth waiting the extra time for the souffle dessert.
"Great food, ambience and service","It was my third visit bringing a fried to celebrate her birthday, after having good experience from my first two visits. The bread was yummy as usual, warm and soft with different types and flavours. Being a bread person, my friend loved it so much that she asked for second round of bread. My friend ordered pork chop and found it tender and juicy. She enjoyed it very much as she found it hard to find pork chop that is cooked well. The restaurant served a slice of cake for her birthday. Our waitstaff Ray provided great services, catering to our seat preference and our requests promptly. Overall we enjoyed a very pleasant evening at the restaurant."
Few ingredient but give me feel WOW!,"1st try in this restaurant, i feel very satisfied and feel amaze by the menu that create by Chef Armando .

This was the menu that i never expected that i can experience. Just using a few ingredient in the item but can get a WOW experience for the guest.

Never try having a cardamom in the sauce for the dessert. It is very unique and it is yummy!!!

The service also very nice and friendly.

Well done Tablescape Sg!!! This restaurant should become one of the Michelin Star Restaurants!!

Definitely will come back again and will recommend to all my frens and family!"
"Delicious food, amazing service and personal touch","Went tonight for dinner with my husband. I'd told them when booking online that I'm dairy free. Venue was beautiful, and we were greeted warmly. The waiter knew of my requirements without prompting and went through my options on the menu. Shortly after, the chef came out to advise how he could adapt the degustation menu to accommodate me. I was blown away by this and so chose that. The food was delicious, beautifully cooked/prepared and presented. The staff were top notch and the food matched. I would highly recommend this restaurant!"
Absolutely incredible experience,My partner and I dined here on new year's eve and enjoyed the wonderful new year's eve menu. Each dish was very special and had a great blend of flavor! I was blown away by the quality and taste of the food and it was honestly one of the best meals I've had. My favourite dish was the squid ink pasta with squid tatare and pumpkin cream. This unique combination really impressed me. The food served at Tablescape is definitely of great quality and is worth every dollar. :)
Perfect New Year’s Eve Dinner,Had the New Year’s Eve Seafood menu few days back with my partner and all I can say is the description lived up to its name! It was truly an amazing experience that skillfully brought out the flavours of the sea in this 5 course menu. The squid ink pasta was beautifully paired with the sweet pumpkin cream. Cod fish was sublime with the perfect sauce and crispy purple potato chips provided the perfect textural balance. Overall it was an amazing experience and i wouldnt expect anything less from Chef Armando seeing as this was the 3rd time I have tasted his creations. Truly talented and humble chef!
We got here following TripAdvisor,"We got here following TripAdvisor and it does not disappointing us . Very good service , and the food was amazing.I really recommended it."
Totally recommend this place,"Totally recommend this place if you wanna eat European style fine dining. My wife and I had the degustation menu, 5 dishes at only 88 SGD. The first two courses deserved a Michelin Star, the following didn’t disappoint us. Nice premises and very prompt and correct but easy service."
Amazing!,"Have an excellent and amazing dinner. Thank you chef Armando, Amzar and the team for preparing such a wonderful dinner and last thank you Derrek and his team for the excellent service and great hospitality."
Cosy place for fantastic post-dinner drinks with friends~,"After a long humid walk down Orchard Road to see the Christmas lights, we were happy to be greeted by a quiet welcoming atmosphere at Tablescape. The seating was cosy and Derrek gave us a fantastic recommendation for our drinks. The wasabi-flavoured chips had a kick which complemented the sweet and tangy cocktail we had. The service was attentive and unobtrusive which was a great way to end our Christmas holiday~ will definitely visit again to try the food and drinks! Compliments to Derrek for his impeccable service!"
Amazing service and alcohol,"Great atmosphere and service here. Me and friends came during Xmas. Was serve by Derrek , his service is so great and serve use special make drinks totally taste awesome. Thankyou so much for making our Christmas so we’ll spend."
"Good service, atmosphere and arrangement",Was celebrating boyfriend’s birthday at Tablescape! Had a very good dinner with boyfriend and all the dishes are great! My favourite is their bread and beef starter! Definitely will come back again and already recommended to my friends! Specially thanks to Derrek for your service and thoughtfulness! My boyfriend and I had a great night!
Awesome service!,"Thank you give us the excellent service,all the food very good,and the staff very attentive,especially mention the chef Fufu,Allen,Roy,Hziq,Derek Thank you all of them,I will come back again♥️♥️"
"Great food, top notch service","The ambience was really pleasing, the staff made us feel very comfortable. We ordered the iberico pork chop and Australian wagyu rump steak which was really good and tender. And the portion was huge ! Celebrated my fiancé’s birthday and was also given a complimentary birthday cake which was really sweet of the restaurant. Thank you:)"
Amazing lunch,We had a wonderful experience in Tablescape. Always a delight. Chef Armando is a very talented chef and all the dishes were amazing. Will definitely come back and will also recommend to my friends.
Wonderful dining experience,"We had an amazing time at Tablescape today with the best pork chop we have ever tasted! Apart from the delectable dishes, the staff was really pleasant as well. Bar manager Derrek was warm and jovial throughout our visit and he made sure the food served was up to standard.

Although there was an issue with one of the dishes that we ordered, Derrek handled it well by giving his sincere apologies and replacing the dish promptly (and even offered us a complimentary starter!). Special mention to sous chef Ethan who came over and explained the situation patiently.

Kudos to the excellent staff team and I would recommend all to visit this hidden gem in Singapore!"
Most hospitable restaurant experience with great food and service.,"My friend specially helped me to book the restaurant to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Bar manager Derek extended a warm welcome even before we arrived and greeted with a big warm smile. He recommended a few very good dishes for us and of the right portion for ua. The food was great! Derek regularly came back to check if we needed any assistance. To end the nice afternoon, a special birthday cake was served to my daughter, with the birthday song from the team of staff.
Thanks, Tablescape for the exceptional experience. We will be back!"
Lunch at tabelscape,"Amazing food, chef Armandi dishes are always an experience. Kooking style is light but full of flavour.The 62° egg with truffle is a must try."
"Great ambience, delicious food, tip-top service!","Great ambience, delicious food, tip-top service! We had a lot of privacy thanks to the renovated layout. And also enjoyed two complimentary dishes on top of our 5-course dinner because we celebrated our anniversary there!"
Over-rated,Overall service was good though was a bit disappointed with the pasta which was very bland and tasteless. Seem a bit very price and over rated
Great food and excellent service,"The food is first class and the service is excellent though the atmosphere and decor is a little bit too formal for Singapore. The desserts are unbelievable and when its time for dessert, the waiter wheels a laden trolley to your table for you to choose from, but whatever you do don't reach for the dessert to help yourself as all the desserts on the trolley are facsimiles! None the less the real ones look just as appetizing."
Best Iberico Pork!,"A relatively quiet and hidden gem within Grand Park Cityhall hotel, but serves great food. Their Iberico Pork is a must try! Extremely tender, juicy, and flavourful."
Impeccable service and great food!,"Chose to dine at Tablescape to celebrate my mother's 60th birthday, and it was an amazing and smooth experience from start to finish! From picking up the phone and confirming my reservation within a quick minute, to helping me with hiding my mother's birthday cake, the service alone made the whole experience a great one. Special thanks to Wen Zhen and Derrek who helped me with coordinating the cake surprise and going along with my ""i'm heading to the washroom"" pretense (Derrek saw me get up and make eye contact and promptly went, ""looking for the ladies maam?"" amazing!)

Absolutely loved the fresh and warm bread! So simple yet so delightful, perfect to start the meal with. My family ordered the organic chicken, iberico pork, wagyu rump steak and risotto. The chicken's portion is slightly small but the rest were alright, the steak had a slightly beefy smell but was still delicious and cooked perfectly medium as requested! The risotto was delightful, and went well with the foie gras and the slightly salty duck breast. We loved the black salt that accompanied the pork and beef as well.

Thank you again to Wen Zhen, Derrek, and Sous Chef Ethan for the delightful meal and service tonight! My family thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Oh, did I mention that the prices are affordable too?"
