Awesome Food..love it,"Had our Chinese New year lunch with 33 family members. Simply loved the good. The beef ribs were so well bbq, well seasoned, soft and tender, family loved it. Next the Pho..the soup was thick, taste just nice, noodle cooked to perfection with generous amount of slice tender beef. My guest that don't take beef, the slice chicken beef was good too. Next the prawn fresh spring rolls is a must to have with their own made sauce, fresh prawns and cook to perfection. Thank you chef Jeff and team for the excellent food. Family of 33 enjoyed it so much. All said "" we will be back again """
Loved it,"My husband and I had a lovely dinner at Red Sparrow. We started with the 6 mixed rolls, then had the charred squid, wagyu and prawn pancake. Everything was delicious and I particularly enjoyed the pancake. Impeccabile service."
Authentic Vietnamese food,"I’m not a total fan of Vietnamese food, but I’m pretty sold by the food offered here. I like the portion offered on the entrees. They were pretty huge including pho. The spring roll platter was a good choice if you couldn’t decide which spring roll to choose from. Plenty of condiments accompanying each dish. Price is slightly higher than other Vietnamese restaurants in the mall, but this was located in Dempsey Hill after all. Recommended for anyone who craves Vietnamese food."
"Good food, bad service","The food we ate was very good, and it came very quickly.
But staff seemed very, very unhappy.
They didn’t smile, or ask how the food was when it came.
After we had finished our main, at least 3 staff members walked past our table repeatedly for about 15 mins and cleared nothing, (and the restaurant was by no means full) or asked if we wanted a dessert menu.
In the end we had to ask, they took the dessert order, still without clearing the table. The dessert again came very quickly, but they put it down on a table still covered with the food plates from the main course.
We had to actually ask them to clear it.
Not one member of the staff smiled, it felt like something was very wrong.
When we left, no one said goodbye or thank you - even though we looked around for someone to say it to ourselves. Not even a glance as we got up and left.
This was a disappointment - as we had looked forward to trying this restaurant after it had reopened from refurbishment."
Worth the $$,Simply yummy is the word ! Solid Vietnamese food though price is on high side. Bought family here and I must say it is very close to the standard in the Vietnamese restaurant in the country! I shall be back !
Ok good,"Waitresses are quite random, never remind me I cannot finish so I kept ordering, in the end habe to take food away and left a few there. Food itself is quite tasty. But a lot food out of service"
Dinner with friends,"Wanted Vietnamese food with friends, food was good, definitely satisfactory, not cheap but it tasted good and we were happy.

Similar to all the other reviews on Google and here about the service, I'll probably give them 1 star maximum 2.
Sometimes it was almost impossible ordering food because after you order 1 thing they walk away and you have to say ""heeey wait.. we also want to order.... Something else"" .

and they all look so sad or upset , I think if you're just after the food it's a good place, if you want a good experience I wouldn't recommend, same with other many reviews about their services online"
Not worth the time,"Service was poor - whenever we order a dish, its not available. We had to wait 15 mins into the ordering before they came to tell us it was not available. No clearing of soiled dishes, topping up of water - not attentive at all. The quality and taste of the food were disappointing"
Best VN,One of the best VN food you can get in SG. Bun Cha was amazing. Fresh hand roll as well as Bo la lot was really good too. Everything was fresh and great
Good dinner experience,We had a Saturday dinner. This is not first time we are visiting. We again appreciated it. Try different meals as the card is wide.
Poor service,"The food was ok, not great but the service was horrible. Asked for some Chili peppers for my soup, and they never bothered. One of servers smelled really bad, everyone noticed. That was a huge turn-off."
Not authentic Vietnamese food,"Was so disappointed by the food. Ordered a prawn fresh roll, beef pho, bun Cha and pork roll, Vietnamese coffee and fresh coconut and paid $107. The highlight was probably the baby Fresh coconut. There was the prawn which was not cleaned out properly, sandwich bun was moist and soft (meant to be fresh). Overall a pricey experience and I would not be visiting again."
Food was good but not exceptional,"The standard of food is like going to Ding Tai Fung for Dim Sum, you get exactly what you thought you would, but nothing much more"
Review,"Food was better than average. Service is half hearted, cutlery seems well used and most of the serving plates are either chipped or crack. Kinda disappointing. Really hope that the standards can be improved."
Exquisite Flavours with Fabulous Textures,"Every dish was a delight to the taste buds. Not only incredibly tasty but the presentation was a treat.
The delicacy and crunchiness of the batter on the beer battered squid was unbelievable.
The dessert was a mixture of foods that I wouldn't dream of putting on one plate.......but what a beautiful surprise as it all worked together so well..........just fabulous."
Really delicious food,"Yummy , fresh food and friendly service . We enjoyed our food and would come again My husband and I had a variety of dishes and they were all very tasty ."
Best Vietnamese restaurant in Singapore,Food was superb. Great location. Definitely coming back again whenever the Vietnamese craving kicks in.
Good Vietnamese food and ambience,"Nice place to try some good Vietnamese food. Portions are comparable to the prices.

If you can't decide on a Springroll they have an option for a variety plate.

Like the ambience as it does give a feel an ol charm of Vietnamese eatery.

Tucked away in Dempsey so its quiet for a weekday. Can be busy on weekends.

Recommended if you don't mind the price."
Experience at Red Sparrow,A nice and cozy ambiance with good food. A good recommendation for family and friends to get together.
Delicious Food,The food was beautifully presented and every dish had a multitude of flavours and textures. We don't normally eat desserts but we did here and it wad delicious.
Best Vietnamese food in SG,"Holy smokes this is a hella good restaurant.
Better make a reservation.

I had a noodle dish, called - it was phenomenal. The lemongrass tofu was so crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and the combo of flavours was, for me, perfect.
The Man had Bun bo nam bo - just fantastic also. I tried a piece of the beef from his dish and it was nomnom delicious. We felt like they were totally worth the price.

We also had cocktails. I had the Ho Chi Minh, and he had the Hue to go. Both were creative very good and they don’t skimp on the alcohol. The drink prices were very reasonable by SG standards.

Service was fast and friendly.

I can’t believe I’ve lived here for > 8 yrs and never been here, but I will definitely return."
"Overall ok, nice place to chill","Food quality is quite good, quite authentic, and at reasonable prices. Unfortunately several items were not available, though it was early afternoon only. Service is good too. The Vietnamese coffee are good!! Nice place to chill"
Very authentic Vietnamese food!,"Very authentic Vietnamese food. Despite services are less attentive as I have to called many times for my water . They don’t even clear the table even when they serve the food where no space available. The fried rolls was good for sharing, the bbq prawn papaya salad was awesome .. the sauce is tangy and flavorful! The traditional pho was great, the garlic fried soft shell crab for sure to pair well with beer. However, the beer is way too expensive for a 333 Saigon beer at $13 a can. I gave it a miss.. the dry beef pho was fantastic and the sauce was perfect blend and refreshing. Love the Bahn-mi with bbq chicken where the bread is freshly bake. The stew chicken with lots of herbs served with freshly bake baguette. Nice decor but the street food in Vietnamese is rather expensive served in this restaurant. Food is great and enjoyable!"
Authentic Vietnamese Food,"Quite authentic and good standard Vietnamese cuisine. Done towards casual HCMC style. A pretty extensive menu with almost every HCMC dishes you can think of.

Service was acceptable with occasional incoherent. Will be better if servers show more friendliness. It is okay if you are not in a hurry or pick on precisions.

Unassuming ambient with a definite HCMC vibe.

above average pricing.

I will come back for casual and authentic Vietnams eat."
Not a bad place for Vietnamese in Dempsey,"I got the pho and the beef rolls for dinner. While the beef rolls were delicious, the pho was just alright (like everywhere else in Singapore)! The restaurant was large so lots of space and the atmosphere was relaxed while still maintaining Vietnam vibes. Service was a bit slow as had to keep asking them to refill our waters. All in all was ok place eat at, nothing too special."
Vietnamese,Comprehensive menu with many original Vietnamese dishes you won't find anywhere else in Singapore. Some dishes are really authentic (the roles are delicious) but some have unfortunately been (noodles) adapted to the local taste. At this price level the restaurant should be able to stick to the original recipes.
Excellent food and service!,Very comfortable and cosy environment. Family has already visited twice and their food and service standards have been consistently excellent! We particularly like the bun cha and Vietnamese rolls (prawn). Setting is great for bigger groups too!
Lunch,The food was So delicious and also a staff are well trained because they give service very well. I really enjoyed pho and the pho was so huge portion.
Poorly trained staff + missing orders,"To the business managers of this restaurant: please look into your training and management systems! With so many staff running around, it’s bewildering how just in one dinner we had so many missing orders which we had to chase down multiple times. No staff once came to ask if everything was Ok, nor did we even get the basics of a glass of water,"
Vietnamese food,"Had lunch and tried the beef pho, braised pork, stir fried daylily flower, fresh roll with sausage, steamed rice, hot tea. Total bill around $93. Price a bit high. Taste average. The staff service was good, perhaps when we were there, the restaurant still empty. Only 1 table of 5pax. The staff were attentive. Can't beat the food when we had in Saigon tho. But overall was good experience."
Authentic fresh Vietnamese food,Had a really tasty lunch. We used to live in Vietnam for few years. It is hard to find fresh authentic tasting Vietnamese food outside of Vietnam. Red Sparrow is one of those rare places.
No hygiene with kitchen staff not wearing masks during this COVID time,None of the kitchen staff was wearing masks and were casual enough to just say sorry when pointed out. Nobody should eat here during COVID times. Have also escalated this to the authorities.
Authentic Vietnamese food,"The food at Red Sparrow was pretty good but more pricey. Using The ENTERTAINER app, I had a 1-for-1 offer for main course.

Being my 1st time there, i tried their beef pho (Pho Bo Tai) and I wasn't disappointed. The soup was tasty and not too diluted or too herbal. You don't get thirsty afterwards

There were ample beef slices and the pho wasn't overcooked. You could ask for extra lime if you like the soup with abit of kick.

I also tried their Mien Cua, which was glass vermicili with soft-shelled crab, crab meat and cabbage, spring onion.

This was the winner for me, as it was very original and filled with wok hei (or claypot hei). It was piping hot and extremely tasty.

I would advise you to share that, as the satiety and flavouring will make you too full to try any other stuff.

Very authentic Vietnamese food, so i shall return to sample other dishes.

Dinner,"Needed a Vietnamese fix, so I visited this restaurant, I’ve been looking at for awhile on Facebook. Finally visited today and it was divine, my favourite was the coffee donuts."
Classic vietnamese cuisine! Worth a visit!,You get all your classic vietnamese cuisine done really well here. We had a bowl of pho that has a generous serving of beef that is very fresh. Totally not skimping on the quality and quantity! Worth a visit!
"Very light, flavourful & delightful.","Very light, flavourful & delightful.

We ordered Beef Pho, a combination of rolls (highly recommended the fried vermicelli rolls) and fried banana dessert to share.

I would recommend everything and it is the kind of night where you want to have something light and wholesome. The dessert is not too sweet and it rounded the meal very nicely."
Excellent service & Amazing food,"Been there twice this month and both times never fail to amaze us. Friendly staff and nice casual ambience. I’m not the biggest fan of Vietnamese cuisine but this place has changed my mind. The fresh spring rolls, pancake, beef pho, garlic calamari, mango salad.... all so good. Ordered a bit of everything to share and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Can’t wait to go back there to try other things on the menu."
Poor services & average food,"When we were seated, no one come forward to tell us to scan for menu, no offer of water. Just plain ignored. Overall attitude and service of all the staff there isn’t good at all. Food is very average and not worth the price. Will not recommend or visit again."
Waited more than 40mins for food and food was burnt...,"Sunday night dinner became a disappointing experience.

We ordered a beef noodle and a bbq pork dish.

We waited more than 40mins for the food to arrive. The beef noodle arrived first. The taste is ok but the BBQ pork came all burnt. It was about 90% burnt and we returned it."
"Overpriced, small servings and nonchalant service","Came here with a family of five. Restaurant was a bit grimy, as were the toilets. Ambiance was that of a family restaurant.

Dishes were generally tasty, but portions were small for the price. A $35 cubed beef dish looked like it used less than 150g of beef. We came at 7.45 in the evening, but hey had run out of 5 dishes that we wanted.

The grilled okra was the only dish that was good value for money. The grilled chicken was $25 and was nothing to write home about.

Our main dishes arrived without the accompanying rice,band we had to wait for another 8 minutes for the rice, and even then only one portion out of the 3 we ordered came first. The rest came 5 minutes later.

Service was nonchalant, no offer of water. We had to ask for water refills and also for our plates to be cleared at the end of the meal. The waiter also got one order wrong.

My family was still hungry after our meal. Sadly, we'll never be back. It's definitely an expat trap."
Red Sparrow!,"Get yourself in here! Great food, attentive staff & ambience! Highly recommend! We will be back! Thank you!"
Had a amazing dinner at Red Sparrow,"We were on a vacations in singapore during my vacation we had a dinner at red sparrow. Food was amazing, excellent service with airy environment. i'll rate it Excellent.. once again thanks Red Sparrow"
Good Tasty Pho,Good Pho and fresh roll( Ca Chuon). Pho has tasty soup and portions is served in a medium sized bowl. Beverages with fresh orange juice and lime soda were great accompaniments. Price is on the high end but the quality of food and taste made it up. Service was friendly and good.
Lunch at Red Sparrow,"Great Food , especially the papaya salad comes with big grilled prawns . Cosy and relaxed ambience . Worth to try ."
Food is marvelous. Service,Food is marvelous. Service is superb. Great atmosphere. A nice authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Will visit again.
Just visited this place for lunch,"Just visited this place for the first time, we really enjoyed the beef pho which came with generous portion of meat servings! Will certainly come again for the Pho and perhaps try another dish!"
Authentic Viet Food with extensive menu,Back for a second time and the mien cua is as good as ever! Really hits the spot. Great service by John once again. :)
Yummy!,"Enjoyed the food and service here, especially the Duck Salad and Grilled Pork. Authentic taste and decent portions! Will be back :)"
Vietnamese fare reminded me of Hanoi!,Was craving hot soupy pho on a cold rainy day and tried Red Sparrow via Burpple. Beef pho had tender slices rich in flavour. The banh xeo was generous in filling and extremely crispy. Would come back here again for authentic Vietnamese food!
Authentic Vietnamese Food,We just had some amazing summer rolls and pho at Red Sparrow.Would definitely recommend it. Warm ambience and great food with sumptuous quantities🙂
Excellent Vietnamese food,Pancake is a must eat. So are the noodle dishes. The ambience and service is great! Friendly to families.
nice food but interior to be improved,"The food was very good! The chicken and especially the Ribs were worth to try. Unfortunately the interior furnishings were a little dated, with crates of bottles propped up in a corner."
Excellent service and authentic Vietnamese food!,"Ordered bun cha, cha ca, banh xeo, and soft shell crab. The bun cha and banh xeo were better than some we’ve had in Vietnam! The portions were generous and tasted great! Our fav was the bun cha, will definitely be back again!

It was my dad’s birthday and they gave us a complimentary dessert complete with a candle, and a happy birthday song!"
Vietnamese food at Dempsey,"One of my favourite spots for Vietnamese food in Singapore. A good selection of Vietnamese dishes, not just the usual pho. Bien Cua (soft shell crab with tang hoon), Thit Long Nuong (Chargrilled Berkshire pork) and Che Chuoi (Battered banana with black glutinous rice) were really good. Quite worth it using Burpple Beyond!"
Amazing Vietnamese food!,"We ordered the Bung Lon Nuong (chargrilled Berkshire pork belly) and Bun Bo Nam Bo (wok-fried lemongrass beef and spicy fermented pork sausage) and they were really tasty. The pork belly had a good char to it, whereas the lemongrass beef was tender and fragrant.

Good ambiance and service!"
Authentic Vietnamese food,"We had Pho noodles, Bun Cha, two types of fried spring rolls, and desserts. All dishes were authentic and good.
We wanted to try Banh me but it was not available, which was a little bummer. Overall, we highly recommend this place for those who look for authentic Vietnamese food."
Pretty good service and food,Pretty good service and real authentic Vietnamese food! Very cozy setup with fast service. Highly recommend singaporeans to come here for a Taste of vietnam!
Food tasted excellent although prices were a little steep,"I had the red snapper (Cha ca) at $30, Bun cha (pork with noodles) at $23 and scallops at $28. All of them tasted excellent but the price is a little steep, though understandable since its at Dempsey."
Dinner,"The food was amazing, especially the beef short ribs and the St. Louis pork ribs. Will definitely come back again!"
Food is excellent,The food is so good and the ambience is authentic. I will be back for more banh xeo! The spring rolls also very crispy and tasty.
Delicious Vietnamese Food,"Tried the Bun Bo Nam Bo ( Wok Fried Lemongrass beef ) the beef is really well marinated and fits incredibly well with the other ingredients.

Also ordered the beef pho ( all toppings ). There is a lot of ingredients , the tendon and brisket reached my expectations and it is really worth the price.

The ambience is great and cozy for dinner. And the service is 10/10."
Leaving angry and hungry after spending 70 dollars,"Started badly I had a reservation but there was some difficulty In seating us even with the reservation. The staff here are clueless, one was so lazy he spilt a jug of water all over the floor behind my chair and just walked off, all the staff just walked over and some even slipped but no one thought to dry the water.

The food was not good, I had the beef pho, the beef was inedible super chewy and bad quality. My husbands meal was no better really lacking flavour and aromomatics. In our starter there was some kind of ceramic chip in my summer roll which I ended up spitting out, how it got there I have no idea

Save your money this is a more expensive viet restaurant and you don’t get anything more for the price. The quality is really cheap and food isn’t tasty enough to justify the extra cost over other viet places. I’m super hungry as I feel like I left most my food due to terrible quality. Don’t bother"
Cheap meat and terrible lazy service,Cheap meat and terrible lazy service. Save your money and go elsewhere. Our worst Singapore restaurant experience in more than 6 years in the country.
Buncha for the win,The pho was really good but the buncha really blew us away. It tasted quite authentic and we couldn’t stop eating it!!
Great Viet Food!,Everything we ordered was great - their grilled meats are exceptional!!! I personally think the pho is rather bland so try the vermicelli instead. Would definitely come back for their vermicelli and their beef short ribs 🥰
Best Vietnamese restaurant in Singapore (Hands down),"My partner and I had the pho and the Vietnamese pancake. They weren’t skimpy on the ingredients at all. The pho had seemingly an endless amount of meat and the soup, was light but savoury — allowing us to last to the end of the meal. Needless to say, it was pho-king good ☺️

The Vietnamese pancake THOUGHHH was the star. Their homemade fish sauce that was made to complement the pancake really blew us away. I don’t know what they put inside the sauce, but I would have it with any food and dishes in the world.

Ambiance was 10/10, food was 10/10, service was 10/10. Definitely would come again!"
Good Vietnamese food,Food was good value for money. Very filling portions even though the prices were on the higher side. The ribs in particular were extremely tender
Authentic Vietnamese Restaurant,A very good place to get your Vietnamese food fix with very nice ambience. Really enjoyed our time here & would come back!
Good Vietnamese Food,"Great food, very big portions. Worth a try! John, our waiter, was attentive and we enjoyed the ambience."
Great food and service 👍,I visited the restaurant over the weekend and loved the food here. The vegetarian pho broth was especially yummy. The portion sizes are also good value for money. The service is great as well. Would definitely visit again.
"Great Vietnamese Food , tried it because of the 1 for 1 Burple promo","We had Pho ga (Chicken) , Banh Xeo (Viet Pancake). The Pho was really great, broth was really rich probably boiled over hours, emptied the bowl of soup. Tbh Banh Xeo was crispy and nicely burnt but personally it was abit gelard towards the end, but it’s good for sharing.
Che Chuoi(Black Glutinous Rice with coconut & fried banana) was nice savoury coconut taste , the glutinous rice was really amazing with a tinge of pandan & coconut taste. Overall it was a really good combination topped with vanilla ice cream. Highly recommended!"
Terrible service,The waiter didn’t even take down our order and the food portion was small. The service took a long time. Taste is only so-so. Ambience isn’t good too.
Authentic Vietnamese food with a cosy ambience and good service,"Great and authentic Vietnamese food, Pho was flavorful with generous portion of ingredients. Loved the Cha Gio (fried rolls) a lot and the coffee donuts - absolutely addictive! Highly recommended and will definitely be back!"
Pho broth and ingredient is,Pho broth and ingredient is excellent.. prawn rice roll n salad is fresh and is refreshing .. service is great
Amazing food and brilliant service!,We had the grilled squid with house special sauce and it was amazing! We were served by John and he was really friendly and polite :)
Great food and ambience!,"We ordered the vegetarian pho, snapper fresh roll, grilled squid and vegetarian pancake. The food was great, especially the squid and house special sauce! The decor was also very pleasing, and so was the overall experience. Shoutout to John our waiter for his attentiveness!"
Awesome food,"Visited red sparrow due to the discount apps, and was pleasantly surprised. Every dish was anything but fabulous and tasty. Price range is slightly slightly high, but hey it’s Dempsey hill and quality food.
Ordered the pho, fried rice, bbq pork belly, chargrilled chicken and Vietnam pancakes, loved all of them!"
Nice Place,Nice ambiance. Food was good and delicious. Price was a little on the high side. Can improve on the service as lunch was packed but a little short handed.
Authentic Vietnamese Food SG,"Food and service was excellent ! The restaurant was very nicely decorated, which gave a really nice ambience"
Authentic Vietnamese restaurant,Lovely Vietnamese restaurant with colorful lanterns and Vietnamese style decor. Service was efficient and friendly with Tjay . We all had Pho (vegetarian and chicken) which was deliciously fresh and authentic and came with fresh Thai basil. We also had a selection of Vietnamese style rice paper rolls and the snapper filled roll was particularly yummy. We will definitely return soon.
Great food and service!,"Was served by a friendly waiter, Tjay, who attended to our needs as and when we required assistance. Will definitely return again for the amazing food!"
A Great Night Out,"The Red Sparrow was a great experience. The food was delicious, the service excellent and the price very good. The interior could probably use a little bit of revamp given the competition in Dempsey Hill but it in no way detracts from the quality of the food."
Great food and service,"Had lunch here with my husband on a lazy rainy afternoon. Ordered chicken pho, prawn spring rolls and snapper spring rolls. All three dishes were amazing comfort food along with friendly service- warmed our stomachs and hearts. Will come here again for sure!"
Nice Vietnamese restaurant,Nice Vietnamese restaurant with pleasant waiters and waitress. The food was ver nice. We had papaya salad with grill prawn. I’m not a pork eater and they are able to accommodate to my request. Fresh wrap was tasty. I had seafood noodles soup. I manage to finish my bowl of generous noodles.
Happy to be “lost” in Vietnam wonderland 🇻🇳😊,"Everything we ordered was spot on! Delicious, tasty and potions were generous. Started with papaya salad and fresh prawn rolls. For mains, we had the beef phô and seafood noodle. Everyone enjoyed their food. Friendly Service staff and good knowledge of their products. Will definitely be back soon!!! Brava!"
Good Food & Service!,"Portions are generous and tasty! Beef Pho, Seafood Noodle, Fresh Prawn Rolls and Papaya Salad - Recommended! :)"
They put MSG in their food !!!!,It heur. Food tasted so good! Then I wondered if they had put MSG in it. I asked and yes they had! Only after I asked did they say that they put MSG in their food and then they started to get antsy because I told them that they had put MSG in the soup I fed my baby and that it’s a neurotoxin :(
Great Taste,Kindly seek the service personnel for advice if it's your first time here as their recommendations are highly credible. As we enjoyed the food that is being suggested.
"Quaint, Cozy, and Delicious",My husband and I stopped by Red Sparrow while on our evening stroll looking for food. We craved a nice bowl of hot noodle soup so we went for Pho! It was delicious and hit the spot. The crew are so friendly as well.
Good First experience!,Food was good and staff were friendly. Nice experience and good find for vietnamese food. Will come back again!
Pho good and yummy,We enjoyed the Pho Dac Biet. Yummy! Authentic and family friendly. Also ordered the rice rolls combo. Will return again. Good reward program too.
Not your typical local Vietnamese restaurant,Not your typical local Vietnamese restaurant with just pho and bahn mi - interesting dishes with robust flavours.
Chargrill chicken is exceptional,"Love the pho, cha gio and goi cuon. My second time here and will definitely come back again. Highly recommend!"
Awesome Chargrilled Beef Short Rib,"if you are a beef rib lover, you really need to try the chargrilled beef ribs here because it is super juicy, tender and flavourful! so thankful and grateful to the team of service angels: Rex, Jen, Galvin, Hema, Tom, Nithian and Head Chef Jeff."
Authentic Vietnam cuisine,"The environment and food here is authentic to the Vietnam culture! Although the food is a little pricy, it is worth coming for the experience! Really friendly staff and good food! Would definitely come back to try!"
Excellent food variety and service,"Love the experience as the food is of high quality and the service was excellent. I recommend trying the dish ""Bo Nurong"" as the meat is filled with delightful flavour and it also melts in your mouth. 10/10 would recommend."
Lunch,I enjoyed the Vietnamese cuisine here. Especially the grilled dishes and the beef pho. Portions are also very generous.
Authentic taste of Vietnam,"Came here for a private dinner with my wife and ordered the char grilled St Louis pork ribs and the tenderloin beef cubes.
The ribs were nicely grilled with a smokey marinated flavour with crispy skin in some parks. The meat was tender enough to slide off the the bone. I especially enjoyed the pickled vegetables that were both juicy and sour!
The beef cubes were flavourful and tender and had a home cooked taste.
The iced black coffee was thick and robust, just the way we liked our coffee."
Good birthday dinner!!!,"Third time coming to Red Sparrow, this time for my birthday with family. Food was amazing as usual. On top of our usual order of Bun Cha, today we tried the soft shell crab and beef short ribs. The soft shell crab is served with amazing fried garlic and the beef short ribs was tender and had an interesting mildly spicy coating of sauce. Highly recommend!"
Excellent food !,Excellent food and attentive service. The rolls are huge and generous. The sugarcane juice with Calamansi packed a lunch. We’ve been here multiple times and it always satisfy.
