Great place but rip off cocktails,"Great outdoor place with good food choices. However the cocktails at least the Long Island Ice Tea get gradually weaker, don‚Äôt order."
"Frenetic, busy but superb","Met some friends here on a Saturday night. Tables are at a premium, but everything is great about this place."
Cheerful ambience and a good vibe,"One of my favourite places to hang out and chill around Haji Lane.

The ambiance is very cheerful and colorful.

The food is nice.

They have alot of drink promotion ongoing if you are looking for any - that's your place.

The service is ok.

Of course it's no more life music over there but I'm still coming over time to time to enjoy the night.

Cheers."
Lively place with good food and pocket friendly,"Lively place and friendly crowd, we loved to sit in the outdoor, beer tower was pocket friendly and flexibility to order from other Indian Resturant Recommended to try peanut masala, paneer tikka and salmon tikka"
Great TGIF Hangout,"The food was great, the drinks were amazing and the service was on pointe. A big shoutout to Andy, Waikit and Jenna for their impeccable service and providing for a great tgif for me and my friend. üíõü•≥."
Shout out to ADRIANA,"Thankyou to ADRIANA for the best service!!
No matter its busy due to rain , she still give what i need for my birthday and farewell celebration!!
Thankyou for the good service !!

We are all happy !! It was a fun night with fun server like you"
Good place to chill,Blu jaz is a good place to chill. Art is being very helpful and friendly. Strongly recommend this place!!!
BluJaz cafe,"I went to the cafe recently solo. Not knowing what to drink, ART asked what I liked and suggested Zombie! That drink is now in my favourite list ..
The staff is welcoming and the atmosphere is fun.. Blujaz is the place for casual chilling !!"
Great Service By Art (:,Came by to have post work drinks all by myself and its great to have such good service and yeah i was entertain by the staffs.
Art is an amazing staff!,"We had a really good time at Blu Jaz thanks to the friendly staff named Art. Appreciate his services and thoughtfulness, will definitely be back again!"
Amazing Ambience!,Staff and ambience was amazing. There's a staff by the name of Art who's super accomodating and friendly! Enjoyed my visit here :)
Great service great atmosphere,"Loved the ambience, drinks are affordable. Shoutout to the waiter Art for excellent service, and for being so friendly and hospitable"
Excellent Service Recovery,We greatly commend the manager Menard for empathising with us and going beyond that extra mile. We usually frequent this place and we would love to come back because of his great service recovery and ensuring that we were all happy:)
Little Bali in Singapore ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Great place to hangout with friends on weekend. Nice ambience with that Bali feeling. Would like to compliment Mr Alfian for his hard work and exceptional performance, very friendly and kind. Will definitely come back again! :)"
Bad service a real mood killer,"Cozy atmosphere and I can see why it‚Äôd be a great place to hang out especially when there‚Äôs live music, but experienced pretty bad service with a server rolling his eyes/not looking up to acknowledge until we addressed him several times.

Came here for drinks after dinner so can‚Äôt comment on the food apart from the potato wedges which were okay - not much flavour. Drinks were not too bad so that‚Äôs a plus point."
"Good food, worst staff","Happened in most places as well , staff manipulate customer when it's comes to seating places.false reservations tags applied in most tables,while there are no reservation.Food and drinks are best,but with the people who runs operation ruins this place."
Good times! lovely ambience! tasty food and friendly service!,"I used to come there for a live music but nowadays its no a chance to find that in SG duo to current situation. other than that it is still a great place to spend the day or eve at haji lane. Food and drinks are delicious and service is just right!

They have some outgoing promotions and happy hours till 20.00pm !

It is actually getting a big problem in SG to find a good service today so thank you guys for all your excellent job yesterday.

definitely will be back soon!

cheers!"
Great!,"We met up with a local here for dinner, I'm so glad he suggested it. We had walked past here earlier in the week but didn't give it much thought. It was fantastic. A varied menu, even an Indian menu which you might need to ask to see. Great atmosphere and friendly, efficient staff. You must try the aloo gobi dish!"
Amazing Surprise Party !!,"Absolutely fantastic experience.
Leave it to Anuj at Blu Jaz and be rest assured your party will go amazing. Infact, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to mention that people will remember your event for years to come.

Delicious Indian Food, Impeccable service.

Despite the entertainers cancelling last min, Anuj was extremely patient. Calm and very helpful in arranging alternatives. He will go out of his way, to ensure everything goes well.

A genuine honest guy, who is passionate about his job.

Will definitely recommend Blu Jaz as a venue to host private events !"
Absolutely Fabulous!,"After taking a walking tour through all the outdoor restaurants that come to life at dusk in the streets of Kampung Gelam, we were attracted by the graffiti and unusual lighting and decor of Blu Jaz. The sweetheart of a waitress, not only brought us pints of beer at half-price (it being 'happy hour'), but kept a sharp eye on our glasses and reminded us that we could do a repeat order since we were still within the time. So we did!

We ordered batter-fried calamari and cheese batons with our drinks, and for mains, fish & chips and quesadillas stuffed with spicy meat and cheese with a side of salad. All the food was scrumptious and the waitress continued to be attentive although the place was packed.

We couldn't manage dessert and left with happy hearts and tummies. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants the wonderful ambience of eating ""on the street"", with super food, cool jazz music, and excellent service!"
lively place in haji lane,"Great place to chill, sit outdoors and people watch in haji lane, and listen to music. Good for large groups as well. They have a surprisingly wide variety of decent food."
Great meal at great prices,Went here in our last evening in Singapore and our only disappointment was that we hadn‚Äôt found it earlier in our stay. Superb food v reasonably priced accompanied by happy hour drinks. Has got a lovely vibe throughout greatly assisted by the wonderful music
This place has a great atmosphere.,This place has a great atmosphere. A great place for a group of friends to gather over a few drinks. Menu decently priced... wide variety too. But food quality is average
Good spot,Had a good evening after being invited by some friends to visit Blu Jazz and level 2 for a Kizomba night. Quite entertaining. Located in an area with some food spots and music.
AMAZING Surprise birthday party!,"Had a fabulous private event at Blu Jaz (Feb 1st). Food was outstanding, service was simply superb, ambience and decoration was beautiful. Anuj went out of his way to ensure everything was perfect, and even allowed us to stay until very much later than their usual hours so we could keep the party going.
Thank you so very much, Anuj and Jitender, for a memorable evening!"
Restful after Walking Kampong Glam,"This is off the main road, but worth the visit. We sat outside and enjoyed a long cooling Tiger beer, whilst waiting for our food. We chose Indian food which both selections provided a fine example of this cuisine"
10th Anniversary Party,"One of the best restaurants to host private party .We hosted our party on 2nd floor restaurant . We had awesome party and kiddos to Anuj for the excellent arrangement . He took away all our tensions and did all arrangements by himself . His suggestions for the party were very valuable . Throughout the party he was managing everything . We didn‚Äôt have to look after food or drinks as he was managing it all very well . All my guests were very happy with the quality of food , the drinks and mixers and loved the venue .I am very thankful to Anuj and team for such a wonderful hosts .

Thanks again for everything Anuj . God bless and may you rise and shine more in the new year ... best wishes"
Great hospitality,Anuj (events manager) takes great care of his clients! He pays attention to details - even if it was a long email with queries & several requests (planning a corporate event). His responses are timely and he is dependable. The costs of holding a corporate event at Blu Jaz is affordable. The private function areas are self sufficient with attached toilet. Great for fuss free events! Thank you Blu Jaz!
VP Amcor,"I am concerned that the service has deteriorated from last year and the great service staff are gone and replaced with staff who are not customer focused. The staff including Keng Keng, Joy Monte, Jay Lou Guinto, Olivia and others have left leaving this establishment with a poor service team that will bring the business down- unfortunate!"
All about the music and live performances,"So, Blu Jaz isn't going to win awards for food (it's passable and when you're having a few drinks it'll keep the hunger at bay) and it's not going to serve you much by way of exotic drinks.

But Haji Lane is one of my favored spots in Singapore because of the live music, the atmosphere on a weekend and in that regard Blu Jaz is one of my go to haunts.

They do some pretty good happy hour deals (and it's more than an hour), the staff can be quite friendly (though service becomes more challenging at busy times, and it does get busy).

So if you want to sit of a weekend evening, listen to some local live acts strumming and singing away and have a wander around the area with its street art and varied shops - then it gets a thumbs up from me."
Don‚Äôt be fooled,"What a great vibe this bar has when you walk in. However, it is a shame that their live music permit has been revoked. To add insult to injury be aware that the drinks are diluted so better to drink elsewhere"
Great chillin place at a reasonable price,Located at the entrance to Kampong Glam this is a great spot for a casual dinner. Enjoyed the Happy ‚ÄúHour‚Äù from 3-8pm with $10 pints of Tiger. The Sambal Fried Rice ($10.90) was a spicy good feed though the ‚Äúprawns‚Äù were more like shrimp - the Australian kind not American.... They have a lot of love music here and an active on line presence so if you want love music check it out on line first.
Nice food and drink option just off Haji Street,"Just off the vibrant revelation that was Haji Street, Bali Jazz has great indoor and outdoor seating and offers great drinks offers and a decent food menu.

We ordered chicken curry - spicy and delicious, served with popadum - and falafel, fresh and moist and generally very good. Also served very quickly after we ordered.

The beer was cheap and the artistic vibe and wall
murals added to the experience.

All in all, very good..."
Not a jazz bar,"Had a decent evening here, food was O.K., drinks were $15 each, but it‚Äôs not a jazz bar. They have a stage but they were not playing jazz. Jazz fans go elsewhere"
"Great place, great food","Love this place, cannot fault the food, drinks or service the Pita bread in particular is excellent best of all the food is reasonably priced. So glad it‚Äôs not far from our accommodation, we‚Äôve already been there 3 times on this visit."
good service and good meal.,Our company having our D&D with blu jaz cafe last friday and we had alot of fun. The place is good and the food is nice worth of money. All thanks to Anuj for helping us out for that wonderful night. Will recommend this place to my friend.
Absolutely Outstanding,"Stumbled upon this place when walking around and absolutely loved it! Ended up back here every night while we were in Singapore even after we shifted hotels and moved further away. The ambience is great. The service is outstanding! Especially Alf! Even went and brought me cigarettes from the 7/11 so I could stay drinking ! Will go back on my next trip
To Singapore !"
The NO that ruined the experience,"Went with a friend for happy hour. I believe the waiters should inform all customers that happy hour is about to end, but no one did. I asked the waiter if I can order another round on happy hour, but he said no. Customers are not always right, but you have to acknowledge whenever they‚Äôre right."
Better in the evening,"We were in Haji lane, Bali and Arab street for a walk and decided to stop here for lunch. It's probably more vibes-y in the evening as the staff didn't look particularly engaging and the food was very average. Nothing special."
Service is so bad,"We were there for a family member‚Äôs birthday dinner. They were really slow at their service and we had to tell them to serve utensils after the food was served. The waiter who took our order seemed so blur and we had to ask twice before water was finally served to our table. Asked them if we could bring a birthday cake from outside and they said okay. When the time came, we asked for the cake to be served with candles lit. They delivered it without taking it from the box or lighting up the candle thereby ruining the surprise. I mean which restaurant brings out the cake in a box and just give us a lighter. Not sure why we are paying for service charge when the service was so poor. Waiters were so moody too. Blu Jazz is no longer how it used to be. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the place to anyone."
A little tad on its service,"Happy Hours with colleagues and business associates on a busy Friday evening. Turned out they were under-staff and long wait for our orders to arrive. Not only so, they had over-charged us for one-for-one drinks which didn‚Äôt come but was checked off in their register. Probably not the best idea to come on Fridays. Just saying."
Awesome party!,"I threw a party for my friends who were leaving town last weekend.

Anuj the event manager made the planning a Breeze with quick responses and great recommendations. On the day, he came to Ensure everything went smoothly and assisted with my every requests.

Gurpreet behind the bar ensured the entire event ran seamlessly. He proactively provided help from the set up to the cleanup. Best part was he kept an eye on the tab for me and everyone else and I knew I could trust him to keep things in check.

I recommend Blujaz for a private party anytime. I did not have to stress about anything, thoroughly enjoyed hosting the party.. everyone who came were impressed with the organisation of the food, drinks and service. I cannot thank the team enough."
Simply Outstanding,"I cannot speak more highly of the staff, service, ambiance, music and food. Ensure you head in for a great feed (love the chimichangas) and relaxing evening.

But what makes this bar so good is the amazing staff, without having to even ask Alf surprised us by organised a cake and song for my fathers 70th.

If you want an awesone experience then this is the place for you.

Alf, thanks for making our trip so much more memorable.

Can't wait to return."
So good we had to go a couple of times,Great place to soak up the Singapore vibe. Frequented by locals and tourists they have a varied menu and great service. They have a happy hour which gives added value
Cool PLace,Will come back again. Great Ambience and food. The vibrant colours and atmosphere was unique. Enjoyed ourselves
Place with Great Ambience and Good Food,"Organized a private event last Thursday. The setting, deco and food was great. Anuj from Blue Jazz helped to guide us through the process of ordering and also made recommendations to further improve the event. Really good service!"
Yeahh,So good experience toneat in haji lane !! It was my favourite place in Singapore!! Really love this restaurant!!
Poor service,I came to blujaz last Saturday and order couple of drink. I was expecting good drinks and service from this place as it was the busiest restaurant we found at middle of the haji street but we were totally disappointed with the cocktail which we ordered. we also talk to the server guy( stevert)about the drink but he was not even able to communicate properly. end up we ordered some beer and left. I suggest to everyone better order beer instead of ordering cocktail and wasting your money on it. we had two bad experience from this place in our first visit. first drink and service. i believe they going to improve it soon.
Private event,"Planned my husband's birthday party at Blu jazz! It was amazing! The setting, deco, hospitality by the staff was good. My family and friends enjoyed the party. Food was delicious. Any private event party? You should just take this place! It is till 2.30am!!!!"
Private Birthday,If you want a venue for a party with stress free planning look no further than Blu Jaz second floor. Very impressed with my dealings with Anuj and his team who couldnt have been more helpful and efficient throughout. The guests were raving about the food and atmosphere. I felt the package was excellent value! I also appreciated the decoration of the space tailored to my theme. Job well done!
Friendly and vibrant bar,"What a great place, locals moved along to make space for us outside at this busy bar. Friendly and helpful staff and customers. Relaxed, chilled and amazed by the stunning art work. Happy hour prices were a bonus.Thanks for a great night."
Friday afternoon watching the world go by,Really great place to relax. Mix of locals and tourists. Reasonably priced drinks and good food. Staff really attentive and helpful. It's a must visit while in Singapore. Always my first stop after leaving the office for the weekend.
Private event at blu jazz cafe,"Yesterday I hosted a private event at blu jazz cafe. The evening was a huge success. The atmosphere was wonderful ,The food and drinks were excellent and the place extremely organized exactly like we asked.
Today I received wonderful reviews from all my friends who were at the party. Everyone had a great time.
Thank you Anuj for your excellent service and assistance.
I highly recommend this place to celebrate events.
Aya"
Fantastic Venue for a private party - Great service,"I hosted my 50th Birthday Bash at Blu Jaz on the 3rd floor for about 58 pax. The venue is magical and created a great atmosphere. We were able to decorate the place to suit my theme, the staff were super accommodating. You can log into your spotify account and play your party playlist, the sound is very good. We all went for the free flow package and the portions were generous, again staff were wonderful. I also ordered several platters of finger food which everyone enjoyed. It was the best party I have ever had thanks to Anuj and his team for their outstanding service, accommodating us, reasonable prices, going with pace of my guests and letting us dance till late."
Good vibe & great food,"After checking out all the options around Haji lane we settled on Blu Jaz.
The bars and outside tables were all busy ( always a good sign), manage to get a table with no wait for a very friendly waiter.
Good menu with good choice, drinks list good too and prices compared to the Clarke Quay area are very reasonable.
Food was great, the Singapore chicken curry and the Prawn sambal were stand out.
Definitely recommend, good food, good prices and lively busy spot."
Drinks & Food was Ok.,Came for some drinks & finger food. Was just about to sit on one of the high chairs and the chair has a metal piece jotting out & tore my Favourite pants!!! Told a crew and all he did was apologised until i told him twice and he called the gm after that. Sadly spoilt my whole night even though 1st round of drinks & finger food was on the house but still it does not cover the fact that my pants was torn because of a chair that was not being checked beforehand. Could be clearly be avoided. Just so sadden by this. But overall food & drinks was fine. Just spoilt thr whole experience of it. Went home with a torn pants. ‚òπ
"Lovely event venue, terrific staff!","We hosted our company's Christmas party at Bluz Jaz last week, and it was nothing but fantastic!

We managed to book the entire second floor (comes with both indoor & outdoor areas) for our event, so we had plenty of space for our entire group. The rental came with AV equipment all provided and staff were very obliging to help us when we had any issues.

Food was good, and the event staff were highly accommodating throughout the night. Special thanks to Anuj and Pawan for making the night very enjoyable for all.

A highly recommended location for your private parties."
Good and cheap drinks in the middle of the heard of Singapore!,Life music in the building. Sit outside and enjoy the nice evenings. In comparison to Clarke Quay and Boat Quay prices- this place can offer you drinks and dinner for a very good price! A lot of young and all generation people can be seen there!
Nice jazz bar,"Located in a creative young generation street called, Hajilane. They play live jazz here with reasonably price of beverage. A glass of Chardonnay cost me 12S$"
Pricy but nice,"Great service, good selection of drinks and a nice live music. Definitely worth visiting for the athmosphere!"
Amazing place to hold your events / parties,"Held a wedding party here. Amazing service from Anuj, always very helpful when we were planning our event. Even went out of his way to decorate the space for us. Affordable for a large group (just meet minimum spending of 1.5k, which is so easy), and best of all it's a no frills place. Highly recommend this place for company/alumni/postwedding/birthday/anykindof parties"
live jazz performers,"Blu Jaz to be the perfect place enjoy live jazz performers and great dinner with friends and colleagues.
There is indoor and outdoor seating. The food and the overall ambience of the place is also nice. 
Staff there joke to joke and try to cheers you u. 

**It just gets too crowded on late weekends and the waiting time is long too.**"
Nice Vibes,"Nice chilled vibes just off haji lane. Music on some nights from the early evening. Providing it's not raining, makes the perfect little spot to sit outside and have a beer"
Great Venue for Company's Event,"We had a successful dinner and dance held at BluJaz. Anuj provide outstanding service prior to event and all the way till event end. He was always there for us, to make sure that our event run smooth and successful. Beth as floor incharge was very good and fast response in accomodating all our enquiry during the event. Will definitely recommend this place for great food and outstanding service"
Great place,"Awesome place to visit after the formula 1 GP. Many bands and plenty of food and drink to choose from. Very relaxed atmosphere and not nearly as expensive as Clarke quay. The staff around the restaurants are very at tentative and courteous. With in walking distance of gate 1 at the GP.
JOE
MELBOURNE."
God food,"I-m from romania and i eat very good. I take fish with chicen wings, bef and fried chips. Price is ok to low comparable whit singapore."
Not bad,"I went there 2 times. 1 time for dinner at the night,1time for myself at the lunch time. I recommend this place at the night to go better than at noon."
BLU JAZZ .HaJi Lane,A little overpriced but nice place .. outdoor seating ..Friendly staff .. had a good evening with friends
Nice place in this area,My first time is Thai night party at 3rd floor of the bar. This place is so packed and the alcohol price is quite high (plus GST and service charge). The second time is just to chill on Sunday night as most of the bars are closed on Sunday. The jazz live band is quite good and my Sangria is acceptable.
Lively bar,A cool place to just have a drink and chill to some nice jazz. There are different levels catering to different needs. Food and drink selection aplenty.
Always fun but fix your aircon,"My friends and I frequent blu jazz for various evenings and came in Saturday evening - the Cuban night. It's always fun at blu jazz, food is okay and drinks are reasonable but dancing on the dance floor is now far far far too hot. The air conditioners are outdated and don't work properly when it's full and there are no fans inside. You know it's a massive problem when in Singapore you go outside to cool down!"
"Great people, great ambience.","We decided to hold our wedding in a very bohemian version, and found Blujaz to be the perfect holding place.

It was the perfect choice as we had one of our happiest nights with family and friends.

My special thanks to Anuj, the Events Manager who worked closely with me and my wife to get the wedding party going. Without him, the wedding wouldn't happened.

And also to Pawan, the Floor In-charge for making our night wonderful with his presence at the bar ensuring everything went smoothly for my guests.

Wonderful place to be, I'll be back there for their Chimichangas soon."
The Comedy Night review,It was excellent. Just what is needed after a busy day. Just couldn't stop laughing. loved all the acts
"Good atmosphere, other than that just ok.","Just stopped off for a drink following a long day out. Very busy, but even so the service very slow and drinks were comparatively expensive for the area. Having said that the atmosphere is good and I can understand why it's popular."
Great food,"We stopped in to Blu Jazz for lunch. We had their dips and bread, along with some beers. Great atmosphere and good service."
"Love the food, setting and the jazz music","Came across this wonderful restaurant, pub and music venue while staying nearby. We went back twice, it was so good."
Well located,Located just near Haji Lane was a good place to pause for a cool drink or two. Pricing is reasonable although service was slow
"Top quality bar, top quality vibes and top quality service!","I booked the second floor of blu jaz for a party and everything was amazing! Have been a long time fan of Blu Jaz and its sister outlets, and booking the venue for a party did not disappoint. The second floor was beautiful, with a mishmash of quirky decor pieces and furniture which gave a fun, cosy and bohemian feel. Anuj, the event manager, was very efficient in answering my queries and giving me advice on everything from food, drinks and even to decorations and table arrangements. The floor in-charge for the day of the party, Pawan, and his colleague were excellent and ensured that my friends, family and I had a perfect party! The food was, as usual, amazing, and the venue was perfect for hosting a large crowd. Would highly recommend Blu Jaz for hosting private events. It is a unique venue one-of-a-kind in Singapore and would definitely impress friends!"
Top Jazz Venue,"I‚Äôm not an avid jazz fan, but I do love good live music of ant type. Friends go here regularly, and had a suspicion that some big names might show. Sure enough, Wayne Tucker, the New Yorker trumpet virtuoso arrived and played an hour long set.

The venue is smallish, with space for about 50 inside, and seating for another 30 outside. Good service."
Blu jaz vibe,Blu jaz is always popular with a lively atmosphere. They have a very good selection of both food and drinks. Happy hour is late afternoon to early evening. The grilled salmon and chicken satay sticks are very good. Well worth a visit.
Ok for happy hour,"I understand people tend to go here for the buy one get one free happy hour drinks and it's handy for nearby offices.

Service is slow, inattentive and very disinterested. Food is poor...we had satay chicken, wings and fish gougons ..all overdone and fried to a crisp. Salmon also overdone though I requested it done medium rare. Poor selection of veg..squash and eggplant?! A tiny scoop of potato. Not enough pita with dips. Here with work colleagues. Would not recommend for food.

Screens for the World Cup cannot be seen when it's raining."
Good value,We ended up at Blu Jaz by default as it was near our accommodation and we were late getting out for dinner. Good service and great variety of meals. Prices a welcome relief from the expensive restaurants closer to the river. The only negative was being right by a busy road but overall was a good value and enjoyable meal.
Great place for events,"Hosted a private event at Blu Jaz Cafe Level 3. Anuj, the events & marketing manager was very prompt answering all my queries and gave me a tour of all the suitable event spaces. This helped me decide which event space to use. On the event day, the staff were attentive and helpful. The event went smoothly and the guests had a good time. The buffet was a nice mix of Mexican,Mediterranean, local & Western dishes. Anuj had the place nicely decorated with balloons. Will recommend your venues to my contacts."
Great place to chill,"Great atmosphere, gives a entirely different feel of being in Singapore... there for a friend‚Äôs birthday celebration. There‚Äôs happy hour price for the beer, Tiger Heineken before 8pm.. we ordered sambal fried rice, yummy... chicken chop never goes wrong.

birthday girl and I ordered marinara (tomato seafood pasta) but it‚Äôs way too salty, and just that few pieces of seafood? Fish and chips were decent.

Great place if you just want to sit back relax and enjoy, chilling with friends with a bowl of Tapioca corn chips with salsa dressing (you can ask for more as they only gave so little), what a good way to end the night... cheers"
Not happy!!!,"I'm a local resident who took my husband to this bar for the first time. We were very disappointed! We ordered the chicken skewers,which we have eaten all over the world. The skewers which were 10 for 10 dollars were barely one bite each in size,the satay sauce was oily and not suitable. Skewers should be at least four time this size for the same price. The cucumber which came with it, only had four tiny pieces for ten skewers, ridiculous! The garden salad we ordered, for 9 dollars, which was just a few pieces of lettuce leaves and 1 cherry tomato cut in half, again ridiculous! Then, to top it all off, we thought as we were on holidays we would have a cocktail. We ordered the long island ice tea which we have also had enjoyed in many places around the world. The long island ice tea at $16 SGD,was the worst ever in history of cocktails! It was watery and made very badly. When we told the staff and the owner, they simply didn't care and they didn't do anything about it. Take our advice, do not waste your money here, choose another more deserving bar or restaurant in this area. They surely have no idea about global hospitality and they missrepresent Singapore tourism. Do not go there. Even a hawker centre/ food court would have replaced the food/ drink if it wasn't made correctly. Stay clear of this one."
"expat, white","If you're a lonely expat worker, far from home, then this is your community centre where you will find other lonely expats. But if you're local, you can really bad service and perhaps no attention at all. Forget about this place. Let it rot."
Good food / good price,"Good ambiance, good food, fair price. Try pasta ail oil with sea food. Perfext level of spice thai sauce."
Great atmosphere,"Called into this great spot for a light dinner and drink, located in a Bali st, this place was pumping. The service was great and staff were very friendly. We had the platter of dips and bread very nice and reasonable . Would recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing place for a drink and snack or 3."
"If you love Jazz,street ambience and buffalo wings..!","Super busy on weekend,I was lucky to find a table. Order 2 bottle of French red wine ,repeat buffalo wings order..good crowd ...great music..

Only downside...1 toilet for about 30-40 peoples... a bit too much.. would be better to have 2 at least separate male and female.."
A great night out,"Wonderful atmosphere and an interesting area to enjoy a meal in. A refreshing change after eating in hawker malls and food centres. Food, drinks and service were all of a good standard"
Surprisingly ok,"When my friend suggested dinner at a music venue, I was a bit hesitant. Really? But it actually turned out ok. Food was hearty, tasty and very reasonably priced. Nice place for a casual dinner. We were seated outside, which looked more conducive for dinner as the inside looked a bit dim."
Good food with great atmosphere,Blu Jaz was just up the road from us and packed every time we went past it so thought we‚Äôd give it a go. We sat inside but outside on the sidewalk was a bit more happening. We ate too early for the live music. The prices were really good. Not massive meals but they still filled us up. My husband loved the Cabonara and the Salmon was great too. Great atmosphere inside and the service was good and really quick. We will be back.
Party Function,"A cool place to hold a cozy farewell party. Good food, friendly management and nice ambience! Love it!"
Wonderful ambience!,"Bali lane is one of the my favourite places in Singapore especially on a Friday evening!
This place sits right in the middle of the lane and ambience is just amazing.
With jazz music and your favourite mediterranean food to go with, nothing much can go wrong."
Wonderful atmosphere,"What‚Äôs not to like? Perfect setting amidst the hustle of the Haji Lane area; excellent, efficient service, live music, and reasonably priced."
Company dinner,"Excellent service, Good customer service. Not forgetting their manager Mr Anuj who tends to all my queries. Relax and Chill atmosphere. Highly recommended"
Relaxed beer and jazz,"Don't know about the food, but people looked happy. I like the place for the great relaxed atmosphere, good beer, good service and live jazz. If this is your thing, you will love this place.."
Casual drink after dinner,This venue is a great place to enjoy after dinner drinks outside while listening to live music. The staff are very helpful. They had 2 for one drinks until 8pm. It‚Äôs located in a colonial style building which adds to the atmosphere. The bar is in a lively area near the sultan mosque. I would thoroughly recommend tourists visit this area for dinner and drinks. I came here in the day on a previous occasion and it lacked the atmosphere.
Amazeballs!,"The best place for everything. With friends, colleagues, dates, you name it. They serve great food, great drinks & great smiles. You have never lived if you have never chilled in Blujazz."
Sunday Jamming Session and a Cold Tiger Beer... Just perfect.,"I am a lover of Jazz and so when in Singapore a visit to the ""Blu Jaz Cafe Bar"" in Bali Lane (Kampong Glam) was high on my must do list. I managed to get to the late night Sunday Jamming Session and it was great... The musicains were on top form and the Tiger Beer was nice and cold. The decor and ambiance is as groovy as the Jazz... Highly recommend this to any Jazz fan."
