We‚Äôll be Back,"Celebrated Chinese New Year 2023 with my significant other at the Dolce Vita, Mandarin Oriental Singapore. DV is one of our fav dining spots.

Went for their buffet brunch with a free flow of champagne, wines, spirits, beers, cocktails, the works. It was a table-service buffet, where the staff bring all the dishes to your table. If you prefer a particular dish, they keep refilling it. Same thing goes with the free-flow. My partner asked for a red wine which was not part of the free flow and guess what, they opened a bottle for us at no extra cost.

The food and drinks are guaranteed to satisfy the most discerning palate. Authentic Italian fare and we both loved so many dishes, we lost count. Mind you, we‚Äôre not big eaters but did their chef proud, I think. LOL.

We‚Äôd the most enjoyable and leisurely meal.

And the service was excellent! Restaurant managers Mehmet, Giruba, and their team were ever so attentive to our smallest requests. My partner said even the lad at the washroom was ever so polite and helpful.

For us, more than the food and drinks, we go for ambience and service. Dolce Vita lived up to its name‚Äîwon five stars in both aspects‚Äîand the food was heavenly, too.

Okay, it cost between S$400-S$500 for a couple, but worth every cent. This is saying a lot, because when it comes to service, my partner is a demanding person, but he is also prepared to pay for excellent service. He wants to go back.

We‚Äôll go back!"
Lovely anniversary dinner!,"We had a lovely dinner at Dolce Vita on our wedding anniversary. We were warmly welcomed and the food was delicious. We were attended by Ganesan, who was all smiles and full of energy. He was very attentive which made the experience even more special. He even went out of the way to help us with something else that was unrelated to the dining experience and ‚Äúsaved our day‚Äù. We are truly impressed. Thank you for making the evening so special!"
"Dolce Vita Great Place, Great Food and Great Service","Dolce Vita has romantic ambience, excellent service staff and exquisite food. A wonderful experience."
The perfect lunch ‚ù§Ô∏è,"We have had the most romantic and decadent lunch. 4 courses and the most delicious of wines!

A huge thank you to Sumo and Ganes for their hospitality and for spoiling us endlessly with little add ons, menu tips and for also our special chocolate and wine delights which we will look forward to enjoying in our room later! ‚ù§Ô∏è

FYI - I‚Äôm writing this poolside post lunch with an exquisite bottle of dessert wine and our lovely servers are still making sure we are having an amazing experience post service. So impressed.

I highly recommend Dolce Vita to all lovers of good food, wine and exceptional service. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Christmas Day Brunch,"Dolce Vita never disappoints, the food and service is first class, a fabulous Christmas Day experience, highly recommend."
Dolce Vita Singapore,"On December 4, 2022, my family and I had dinner at the Dolce Vita in Singapore. We have only warm and sincere emotions from visiting this restaurant. I want to note the special merit of the sensitive staff, and especially Mehmet, who, with his professionalism, made our evening at Dolce Vita even more unforgettable."
A night out with my bestie ü•∞,Had a lovely evening at Dolce Vita at the Mandarin Oriental. We were looked after by this bubbly smart young man Ganesan. He was full of life and bustling with energy smiling all the way. Courteous and efficient was his service and love the recommendations. A must visit and ask for Ganesan.
Anniversary dinner,"We had wonderful anniversary celebration in dolce vita, and it was the best choice we made, they made our day special and everything about them was marvelous, the food, the location, the ambiance and specially the service."
Birthday brunch,"These guys are super friendly nothing was too much trouble, the food was great, the glass was always full and every service staff had a smile on their face, well done guys X we will be back for sure."
Nice Italian Dinner,"We came here for an early birthday celebration and it was great.
Beautiful restaurant, they gave us a table facing MBS which was lovely.
Food was delicious, the squid ink pasta was delightful & bursting with flavour.
Service was impeccable. We had Ganesan who was friendly and attentive. Very thoughtful , surprising us with a small but delicious birthday cake, offering to take photos for us, etc.
Overall a very pleasant dining experience and we look forward to be back!"
That Lone Star named Osso Buco,"I booked a celebration dinner with 2 friends. Our group had fairly high expectations as we read generally good reviews about the food on social media

There were only 3 of us but we ordered enough food and wine to feed 5! Although this was our first visit, we had confidence in Dolce Vita!

Our Antipasti was Burrata Caprese. The burrata was fresh and creamy, characteristic of produce from Puglia but the heirloom tomatoes pesto accompaniment did not elevate the dish

We had Margherita pizza and Truffle fries as Antipasto Da Dividere. The pizza had no WOW factor that one would expect from a fine Italian resturant. It looked meh and tasted like just an ordinary poolside pizza at best!

Main courses were Spaghetti Chitarra, Bottoni, Black Angus Tenderloin and Osso Buco

Spaghetti Chitarra was tossed in a generous layer of basil pine nut pesto. As the texture of the pesto was not smooth (it was borderline pasty), it made the pasta dish very ""heavy"" on the palate and stomach

The ratio of prawns to pasta was balanced for the ravioli bottoni, however, the prawn bisque needed some acidity to give it freshness and Cognac to elevate it to the next level

My angus tenderloin was a complete disappointment! The meat was prepared to my liking (medium rare) but it was not tender. In fact it was dry like old cow and had no beef taste! It was very painful to waste a piece of supposedly good meat but I had to void the order as it was simply unpalatable and it cannot justify the hefty price tag of $68 for approx 150g! The beef jus was the highlight instead! My replacement lamb had a good sear and the crust was delicious! Overall, the lamb was tender but under seasoned. The lamb jus lacked flavour and could not complete the dish

The lone star of the night was Osso Buco. Fall off the bone, tender, tasty - even the most difficult, picky and unadventurous eater in my group gave it thumbs up. Our regret was we should have ordered Osso Buco for our main courses instead of trying 4 different pasta/main courses which missed the mark!

We felt a stark contrast in service level between Dolce Vita's somewhat sluggish service vs Melt Cafe's efficient breakfast service during our recent stay

Although I had requested for a table with good view, lighting and air conditioning, the air conditioning above our table kept ""dying"" throughout dinner service from 7-10pm. We had to endure the stuffiness owing to the still air whenever the air conditioning stopped. Also, I am baffled with the purpose of the reservation portal having a tab for customers to indicate special occasions (if any). I indicated ""celebration"" in my booking but none of our servers checked if we were celebrating anything. It certainly does not feel that my reservation requests were taken into consideration at all

Our bill was $438

Overall, we did not feel satisfied with our food with exception of the lone star Osso Buco nor the overall ambience. At similar price points, Bistecca Tuscan steakhouse and Mozza Osteria are unbeatable!"
"Overpriced, Understaffed, Non-Customer Friendly","The Food was Good, service was Horrific! For a hotel with such a stellar reputation I find it hard to believe the service would be so bad but it was. The restaurant was understaffed. Our champagne order was twice forgotten, the food came late and I had to stop people to give us the necessary utensils when plates were changed. The taste of the food was passable not worth the money we paid. It showed bad taste on my part and I was embarrassed in front of my client!!! If you want to eat and discuss business do not go here!"
Birthday dinner,"Had a wonderful birthday dinner here, with amazing service from Ganesan. The food was spectacular but the service is what made it very special because we had not mentioned in the reservation that it was a birthday dinner.

We loved everything and will be back again soon!"
Very good food,We tried a variety of the food and the flavours and taste are amazing.Chef Niccolo was the chef that day.my personal favourite is the beef capaccio
Good food and good service,"First visit, ordered the set menu. The risotto, special riserva selection acquerello rice, roasted mushroom was above average although a bit too salty for me. Added SGD10 for the pan seared swordfish in brown butter which was good, my first time eating swordfish.
The tiramisu was good too, I also liked their bread basket.
Nice ambience and friendly service, a good place to have a relaxing meal.
When I was on my way out the lady staff opened the door for me, what a nice gesture."
Not good at all,"Had business lunch with associates . The place is nice , service good , but food is not of quality . In fact , quite substandard . We tried all the signatures , including Risotto (lack flavor and undercooked ) and Tiramisu ( actually more of a small chocolate tart ) . The whole Dino g experience felt like food from a Low end canteen .
Not coming back and I do feel there are plenty of other choices in the vicinity that is half the cost"
Awesome Service!,Fantastic service by GANESAN. He was attentive and always pleasant in his dealings with my table. Fabulous wine selection as well.
Excellent evening,Dolce Vita is excellent - food and service. Uzair and Ganes give outstanding service. I had 2 dinners Hee during my stay and both were faultless
Italian food,"amazing food ! staff with good service .
good view can see marina bay hotel but tree blocked.
dinner in front of swimming pool"
Rosy and Dolce Vita,I arrived at Dolce Vita without a reservation. We had super important clients and Rosy the waitress gave us the best seat in the house. Fantastic views of Marina Bay and superb service. Rosy is Korean and knows how to serve clients. I would come to Dolce Vita just for her. This wasn't a fluke but she sincerely tried to assist us and resylted ini flying colors. I would tecommend Rosy and Dolce Vita any day.
Busy dinner but the service was still great!,"Came with friends for drinks and dinner at Bay@5 last Saturday night. Pretty busy and packed that night but service was still great - our waitress Jaselyn introduced herself and took care of us very well, even coming back to our table after food was served to make sure we were happy. Will come back again for the service."
"Great food, great service, pricey!","Ordered from the prix fixe menu - had a sald to start, following by the organic eggs and tiramisu for desserts. All the dishes were expertly prepared - healthy and flavorful. Definitely recommended."
Excellent food and service,"On their menu, there was only one soup item, but I didn't particularly want tovhave that. So I asked whether they could make some other soup that's not on the menu. They could, and I was served one of the best tomato soups I have ever had!

My main course, Dover sole was also excellent."
Lovely meal,"Starter was great, cauliflower panna cotta complemented the crab well. Poached pear was divine, one of the nicest desserts I've had and one of the most creative!"
Thank you for your kind services,"I went with my friends we sent nice day. Thank you Ck, Rosy we got very nice services from you guys. We want to visit again. We celebreated our friends birthday very well. The place was nice aswell evedything was perfect. Thank you so much"
Excellent four course lunch,"We enjoyed a wonderful lunch!

The food was excellent, with beautiful combinations of flavours. Some of the dishes were truly surprising (in a good way)! The portions were a good size for a four-course meal, but even then we were extremely full by the end.

The service staff were attentive without being overbearing. CK greeted us warmly, and helped clarify some of the issues with our reservation. He was also extremely accommodating of our needs and requests. He went out of his way to ensure that the food we ordered was per our requirements. Other service staff were also friendly and prompt. Fantastic stuff!

The only issue we faced was with making the reservation in the first place. But the MO hotel staff helped us, and the staff in the restaurant easily sorted out the remaining issues.

Overall, fantastic food, excellent service, and great value. I‚Äôll come again, and I‚Äôll also recommend this lunch to my friends and family. Thank you Dolce Vita!"
Italian food at its best,high class food of an excellent Chef. Because of the situation right beside the swimming pool i personally would prefer a little more relaxed atmosphere more like a trattoria.The sevice is fantastic like everywhere in this hotel
Thank you for the yummy food and great service!!,We celebrated a friend‚Äôs bday at Dolce Vita. Nice location with great view of the Marina Bay. Thank you so much CK for being so attentive and DV team for the bday cake for my friend! The food is beautifully plated and every single dish is so yummy!
Wonderful brunch at Dolce Vita with great food and service,"We loved the brunch that we had last week at Dolce Vita, with tasty and fulfilling food, free flow drinks and a top notch service by Jaselyn, aka Jess :) . The other staffs was good as well but not as courteous as Jaselyn. She gave us a really great service with a wonderful smile and many kind gestures. A splendid restaurant with an excellent service!"
Great food and experience,Great food and ambiance. Celebrated husband's birthday and it was a memorable experience. Chefs and service staff are all very friendly. Chefs even come out to explain the new menu.
Fantastic Brunch with amazing service!,We had Sunday Brunch and it was absolutely amazing. The food was delicious and the highlight of course was the exceptional and wonderful service by Jaselyn. She was a delight and provided us with a 5 star service! We will definitely come here again :)
I spent my great Bday here:),"I love the food I had for birthday, it was really beautiful n tasty! and there is very nice view! I wanna visit here again!"
Worth A Visit,"Had an enjoyable lunch here today. It is located poolside, with seating indoors and by the pool.

Service was friendly and excellent. Foodwise, it was mostly hits. We started with the hamachi of amberjack fish, with avocado puree and crispy rice tuile. The dish was nicely balanced. The celeriac soup was nice, if a tad salty.

I had the risotto with artichoke coulis, while the missus had the lasagnetta with eggplant. Both dishes were tasty, but the coffee and cacao keropok elevated the latter dish. I am not a huge fan of vegetarian dishes but can imagine how some friends would also love these.

Dessert was salted caramel chocolate tart with vanilla ice cream, which I utterly demolished. My wife found it a little too sweet.

Do note they are only open from Thursdays to Sundays."
"Nice view, good food and excellent service.",Food are good and excellent service from all and especially Joshua. Thank you Joshua for your excellent service and friendliness. It‚Äôs been a lovely anniversary dinner experience for my husband and I. Keep up the great work!
An unforgettable experience,"Wow! Another unforgettable experience. Once again the service was top notch and food was exceptional. We had an amazing experience from the Amuse Bouche, Appetisers mains and desserts. Nestled in the Mandarin Oriental hotel, this gem serves Michelin quality food with service and atmosphere to match, with a nice view of Marina Bay Sands. This is the second time I have been here and I‚Äôm looking forward to dining again. The new Head Chef and His team have taken the menu to a whole new level - I‚Äôm excited to see what‚Äôs next at our next meal at Dolce Vita."
Pre v day dinner,Food was excellent. Ck and joshua made the food even more tasty with their wonderful service. Would definitely come back
Wonderful Service Staff,"My husband and I visited Dolce Vita for dinner on 11 Feb 2022. It was a dinner for our 7th anniversary and the staff allocated us to sit at a quiet corner which we appreciated very much. CK and Joshua served us throughout our meal, making sure everything is fine and our requests are met. Both of us really enjoyed the starters and handmade pasta dishes (cant remember the dish name anymore), we will come back again to try other dishes and the wine selection after I give birth :)"
Black Truffle Experience,"Came here to try out the black truffle set menu and were not disappointed. It was one of first quality dinners we had since coming back in December last year.

We took the 4 course menu:
- Crispy Cheese Appetizer
- Spaghetti w/ Pumpkin Cream
- Braised Beef Cheek
- Banana Pecan Nut dessert

All the food items were amazing and nicely portioned as we do not consume much.

What was equally amazing was the service headed by WenWei. CK, Joshua, and Hucksen were attentive and always checked on us especially since we had dietary needs which were nicely accommodated by the chef with the help of the team.

Really good experience, food, and ambiance."
Everything is good except...,"Nice vibe, nice food, nice people especially Hucksen. He is very friendly and knowledgeable. Everything is good except the food portion. For heavy eaters might not be ideal. I went down to eat teppa ya afterwards haha"
Unforgettable birthday,"I celebrated my birthday with my family, everything was perfect, delicious food and a great atmosphere. A special praise to Hucksen, very attentive and professional."
Amazing lunch time!,"Quiet setting, with very attentive waiters (CK&Joshua)! Constantly checking in on us, and we never had to request for them to fill our drinks, as they will take the initiative to do so . Food is not bad, value for money during lunch!."
Very affordable and delicious food!,"Was at mandarin oriental for a staycation and decided to have some Italian for lunch! Dolce Vita offered a very affordable 2-3 course lunch menu, with very delicious pastas and desserts! The chocolate raspberry tart was definitely a standout for the meal :) the waiters were also super on point with their service, and our servers, CK and Joshua, were extremely friendly and helpful throughout our entire meal :)"
Great food Great Service!,"Wonderful experience over a lunar new year eve reunion dinner .Had the truffle course menu and was impressed especially by the truffle ice cream dessert. Also very nice touches from their Hors d'oeuvres to chocolate pieces before dessert. CK and Hucksen were wonderful with their service, with extra kudos to CK that made our dinner enjoyable."
"Fabulous food, impeccable service","Delicious food and impeccable service from Huxson and the restaurant team. Great selection of wines by the glass, very high quality ingredients presented beautifully. Every dish was superb."
Amazing experience,The buffalo mozzarella was great! Huckson was also really lovely and helpful. The food was all super really good too

Birthday dinner,"Was here to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend. Awesome and delicious food, service was excellent with CK and Joshua serving us.

Cheer to a new year!"
Cancelled Reservation without Explanation,"I had eaten at this restaurant on several occasions and found it excellent. That's why my family reserved 2 tables through Chope for 25 December 2021 to celebrate Christmas. We received email confirmations of the reservation.

I was therefore dismayed when we got a tersely worded email at noon on Christmas Day itself, from a sender called Sevenrooms cancelling both our reservations without any explanation or apology whatsoever. The restaurant did not bother to call, and luckily I saw the emails in time. My family was really upset because we were unable to find another comparable restaurant for dinner on Christmas Day at such short notice. We ended up eating at the hawker centre. It was a tremendous let-down."
Nice atmosphere with friendly and helpful server,Food very nice. My hubby reserve this place during Christmas day. The server are friendly and attentive to our needs. Thumb up for their food and service
Great Christmas Dinner,Love the atmosphere. Highly recommend the outdoor setting (dinner). It's cooling and you get to enjoy sound of the waterfall too. The staff are super friendly and professional. The appetizers (hamachi) and main course (seabass) was a delight. Recommended
Excellent Service from CK,"Excellent service, particularly our waiter CK. The food was exceptional and the view fantastic. We went for our anniversary and the extra bonuses - (free nibbles and chocolate) did not go unnoticed. The price was also very reasonable for the standard of the cuisine. A definite recommendation."
Anniversary meal,"It was our anniversary and we picked a table outside but as it was so humid, decided to change to an indoor seating 5 minutes into it. Excellent service provided by CK. We felt so comfortable and well taken care of. Delicious food and we even got some free chocolate as well. Would definitely come back again. Thank you CK!"
Subpar at best,"Not at all impressed with food and service! Long wait for the food and when it comes, not all that great comparing to other impressive options available in Singapore! Service was really bad, they act like they are busy even though there several of them running around aimlessly! Won‚Äôt be going back!"
Second visit. Still great.,"The poolside restaurant provides a great ambience. Together with great service and awesome dishes, it's one of my favourite chilll out places in SG. Shout out to CK and his wonderful colleagues for the wonderful evening."
Nice ambience Italian restaurant worth a try,"Great experience and nice ambience. Food is nice and worth dining again.
Being served by CK, very friendly and a great server. Keep it up."
Great romantic date night Italain place,"This was our 5th or 6th visit. Excellent ambience, our go to place for Italian food for date night. Very romantic, usually quiet, service is good, very personal. Food options are limited but everything on the menu is worth a try.

Great service on our recent visit by CK, will keep visiting!"
"An amazing dining experience, ambience & great hospitality, each & every time!","Kudos to the Dolce Vita team for the wonderful time we had once again, they are never disappointing!

The kitchen is currently helmed by chef de cuisine Niccolo Ferrazzani from Florence, who certainly made sure our palates were excited from the first dish through to the desserts. Check out the photos!

With over a decade of experience working with establishments including Michelin-starred restaurants & hotels around the world, it's no wonder - thank you chef Niccolo, this gorgeous lunch definitely made our day!

Special mention to the Head of Beverage, Inthran and restaurant manager Wen Wei for heading the team with the amazing hospitality & attention to details, we could say our dining experience was perfect & complete thanks to each of you! We will definitely spread the word & look forward to the next time already, possibly a dinner!"

Another great meal,"Another fantastic dinner at Dolce Vita, I have been coming here for more than six years (two year gap with Covid‚Ä¶) and always have a fantastic time.

The location is second to none in Singapore, by the amazing MO pool by Marina Bay, and the service, and cuisine is even better.

Cannot recommend the restaurant enough."

Enjoyed dinner in the indoor area by the pool and moved to the outdoor bar for drinks and dessert after. The view of Marina Bay is to die for!
Highly recommend the mushroom tortellini & leek and potato soup."
Dinner at Dolce Vita,Lovely restaurant with a warm ambience. The food and service is excellent! The waiters are very friendly and professional. They are very efficient and attentive. I would like to commend CK and Joshua on a job well done. Would definitely come back again.

Great place with great service,The service staff were friendly and helpful. The food was great too. Go for the desserts as they weren't too sweet and the taste was awesome. Just remember to alight at Mandarin Oriental hotel lobby if you are taking a taxi to it.
Nice ambience,"Food was good, warm and cozy atmosphere. CK and Joshua, our waiters, were attentive and friendly! Recommended for cozy gatherings with friends/family"
Great service and food,"Very cosy and classy ambience with stellar service to boot. We had a really enjoyable evening.
The only gripe would be the accessibility of the place. It was difficult to find, especially if arriving via taxi. Make sure to alight at the Mandarin Oriental lobby, not Park Royal."
Nice and warm experience,The food was great and the staff here were very warm and attentive too. We had a great night here thanks to the team. Just remember to put your taxi drop off point at mandarin oriental instead of the restaurant itself. We were dropped off at Park Royal instead.
Good food and excellent service!,"We had a great time! Food was great. CK & Pradeep, our servers, were excellent :) and the view of MBS and CBD was wonderful too"
Best service,"We had a birthday dinner at Dolce Vita (our first time here) and the food was amazing. I‚Äôm leaving this review to give a huge shoutout to the gentlemen who looked after us the entire evening - Mr. Hucksen and Mr. Pardeep. Mr. Hucksen also handled my reservation and kindly helped arrange a table with a gorgeous view for us to enjoy. Thank you so much for your professionalism, expertise, and kind, friendly attitude! You helped make our celebration special. :)"
Enjoyable dinner,"We had Joshua in charge of us for the dinner. He was patient and knowledgeable. Because it‚Äôs our first time visiting (4 of us) we are not sure how big is each serving. Joshua did a good job of recommending how we should go about ordering, and it turns out perfect. He also will check on us during the dining to make sure we have our drinks filled and the food served in time.

As for the food, it was very good. There are not a lot of selection in the menu, but rest assured, each dish was carefully curated by the chef. We had 2 starter, 2 pasta dishes, 1 beef and 1 fish. All were perfect. In fact we had a good time sharing, and enjoyed all the dishes and it‚Äôs flavour.

Overall the dining experience was good, and we look forward to visit again."
Excellent dinner for special event.,"Excellent food and wine , nice ambience and very good service.we got a nice table in line with our booking . Special mention for CK who take care of us."

Exceptional service,Had a fantastic authentic italian meal with a twist. The tortellini was out of this world! The best part of the evening was the excellent service provided by Joshua.
