Family lunch on a hot day,"Good selection of different food here. I had the spaghetti vongole, the kids pizza other had hamburgers. All serviced quickly with cheerful service.

Everybody enjoyed their meals in a nice setting.

Only problem came a day or 2 later when I discovered that I had paid for somebody else's (more expensive ) bill. That will teach me to pay more attention."
Exquisite,"A very pleasant, relaxing place ideal to go alone, with your partner or family. The food is extremely exquisite, it is really worth every dollar paid, highly recommended, the staff is extremely attentive and smiling at all times. super yes what return."
Service is rude,"Food is ok, but it‚Äôs strange to expect a good European food in Asia, you have to eat Asian food in Singapore. Waiter had to be asked to turn music less loud 3 times. Attitude was rude"
Who does this?,"I am (was) a regular customer for 12 years. Walked over for lunch day and the three tables set aside for outdoor dining were occupied. I asked if they could accommodate me at the other outdoor dining area. ‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt have the staff‚Äù. The indoor seating only had a few diners. ‚ÄúWell, we just don‚Äôt do that. What if everyone wanted to sit out there?‚Äù Hmmm, then Wine Connection would make more money? ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. So, I went to Prive."
Excellent service,Kudos to Manisha for the excellent service. Enjoyed coming back here due to the friendly service. She makes one feels at home here
Is this a 'rude service' concept restaurant?,"I don't think I have ever received service as bad as what we received here. The words that come out of the waiters mouths, will leave you speechless.

While the staff didn't physically stick their middle finger in our face, that is pretty much their attitude towards patrons. The food is eatable; it isn't bad nor is it great. The presentation however aligns more with the waiters attitude.

If you wanted reasonably priced wine and every other outlet on Robertson Quay was shut, I might recommend this place. However unless you plan on drinking enough wine to black out all memory of the evening, I'd give it a miss."
The audacity of the waiter,"We ordered our food, and told the staff that we will go out for 10minutes.
10minutes later we are back, and the food is already served and cold. We start eating it.
I ordered a medium-rare steak. I get a medium-well done one. We complain, and the waiter blamed us for the fact of going out for 10minutes, even-though we informed the staff. He argue with us and tried to demonstrate that a medium-rare steak would cook by itself while cooling down as the plate was warmish.
He accepted to re cook the steak. With all the audacity in the world he came back with the meat and asked me to check it in front of him. The arrogance of that waiter. Never seen that before. I hate 2/3 of the steak and left a part cool down for 30minutes. It never turns up becoming medium well done.

Such a terrible service and experience.
And they charge 10% for that‚Ä¶

No idea if the food was good or not as obviously such a service spoil the whole experience.

Never coming back again."
Fun concept - A good spot for Cheese and Wine,"I loved the concept.
FOund it on an online search looking for a unique food experience in Singapore.
Choose your cheeses and they make up a platter for you.
Choose matching wines or pick whatever you wish off their extensive menu.
Friendly staff, great service.
Watch them make up the platters in the open front kitchen space.
Nice if you are looking for a change from Asian foods."
Disappointing experience,"On 25th July, we visited this place. It was a such a bad experience from extremely poor service to bad tasting food, worst made drinks. Most importantly the attitude of the staff, our drinks was spilled in front of us but they wouldn't change it, expected us to drink half the quantity and pay full price. Extremely bad design of the app which meant wrong orders but Restuarant wouldn't care. They lost group of us, that week we were planning few more office get together but moved to another location and every party I go, I share my experience. Guess you know what They don't care. It's just a drop of an ocean."
Such a disappointment... it used to be one of my go to places,"My recent visit was nothing short of a major disappointment. No longer the waiting staff know their menu or wine. You simply order using a QR code and that personal service has gone out of the window. We ordered our food. A starter to share and two main courses. The starter came quickly but within minutes our main courses were sent across while we had just started to eat the starter. The main courses were left on our table getting cold. When asked why there was no explanation just that this is what we had ordered. The staff have no idea of how to serve or provide hospitality. I had to show a picture of the wine I had selected before they understood. Very poor for hospitality industry.
Such a disappointment when this place used to be so good. Will not be returning
Wine Connection: Sort yourselves out... the quality of food has also gone downhill"
Disappointing‚Ä¶.they don‚Äôt get the basics right,"Everything needs to be ordered off the app, there are no hard copy menus and no one taking your order to ask questions to which creates no personal customer service. I don‚Äôt understand why restaurants continue to do this still when they are part of the service industry‚Ä¶The wines by the glass don‚Äôt tell you which country they are from which is surely a basic part of the description. The starters and mains came out at the same time which meant dishes got cold and there was too much food on the table at once, except for one main which arrived 15mins after the others‚Ä¶.The rib eye steak was very fatty, couldn‚Äôt eat almost half of it. Disappointing, thankfully it is fairly reasonably priced!"
Shame - you just lost a client...,"I made a reservation online and turned up to the restaurant on time. It turns out that I made a reservation at the wrong restaurant (Unity Square mixed up with Unity Street...). I clearly did not have time to get to Unity Square and so I asked the person at the reception if we could have a table anyway (seeing that there were many free tables in the restaurant) - I was told straight away ""no"" and not offered any other option. Extremely rude and very poor customer service. You may have good and reasonably priced wine, but I will not be returning to Wine Connection anytime soon. We had a delicious Japanese meal just down the road instead! Such a shame."
As good as usual,"As good as usual.

It was a busy Friday and I got a chance to have a table in the evening.

Everything was fast and enjoyable.

The staff was friendly and attentive too.
I forgot the name of the Philippine lady who was taking care of us that night but she did her job well.

Only one thing to mention, you need to slow down on the Lemon juice for your Greek salad . It's like my lemon juice as I'm having every morning. Good for your well-being but...abit too sour for the starter.

Thank you and see you soon"
Might be good for locals. Not for tourists,Looks really lovely. Unfortunately not great for travelers. No WiFi that could function to access the menu so really only catering for locals who have internet.. Menu accessed via QR code so couldn‚Äôt access the menu and no hard copy options. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Terrible Service!,"Made a reservation here at 2:30pm in outdoor area. Arrived in the said timing, not busy (3tables taken at that moment) Assistant Manager named Bobby assisting us in indoor seating, my friend told him if we can seat outdoor, and he's pointing a table near walkway and I asked if we can seat on a table that is on the side, and he's telling that the table there is reserved and I asked him I also reserved a table though and I even request for an outdoor. Then thats the time that he allow us to seat on the preferred table. We order caesar with chicken but dissapointing to say there is a big napkin (tissue in the salad that they served to us) *photo attached for reference. We call the Lady server to inform about the salad but she's in personal call and just wave her hand to us like wait. We call Bobby to inform and he just take out the salad and our plate without apologizing and go, never came back to our table at all until we call him because he never replace our plate and cutleries, how to eat the rest of our order if no plate and cutleries? Tell me! I dont know how these guy become assistant manager, dont know how to do a service recovery, honestly shamed on you! Mcdonalds is better that your service! knowing that they are fastfood and wine connection is not. This is the worst experience we had in a restaurant of wine connection."
Wine connection PLQ,"The food is good value for money. I regularly visit this outlet for their set lunch and have a glass or two of red wine to accompany. I occasionally will buy a bottle to drink with the lunch. Service staff provide good service.

Today the visit was not as satisfying. I ordered set lunch with a glass of Merlot, plus an additional glass of Pinot noir. The salad came with the wine and I was about to enjoy the meal when the main dish came. I asked for it to be taken back and to be served after I finish the salad. Manager said it was their policy to serve at same time. He said that during my previous visits the kitchen was probably busy and that was why the main dish came after I finished the salad.

I stopped eating as it is not my style to have to gulp my food to support the outlet policy of rushing food through.

I canceled my lunch to go eat somewhere more supportive of casual dining."
Always enjoyable,"This is a friendly place , the staff is always helpful, very fat service , very good balance price / Quality"
"Nice, thin crust pizza","I've tried the pizza twice and on both occasions it was prety good. The crust has a semolina base making it quite crunchy. I've tried the margarita and the carpacio, and what I like is that the sauce is well seasoned. But unlike other pizzas this doesn't come with side of dry herbs like oregano or paprika.."
Bad experience,"I came a few months back and had a great time. This time i received veg, then 10mins later fish, after i had eaten came wine then after i had drink it came french fries
Lousy-the waitress seemed to think it was a great joke- well my plan was to order more wine but instead i walked out"
Favourite wine place in SG!,"When you‚Äôre looking for budget friendly wines with a decent selection, then wine connection would be yur best choice!

The staff are super friendly and accommodating. I go here frequently and I‚Äôve never been disappointed. They remember your orders, and suggest wines that fits your palette. Shiva picks my wine for me!

10/10 would recommend!"
GR8!,always good! been here too many times and def will visit again - prefer the outlet at Robertson Quay area.
"Good food, wines and great service!","Came here to celebrate our birthdays together and we had a wonderful time!

Enjoyed the red wine and the champagne. More selections and reasonably priced wines.

Pizza with overflowing toppings was delicious. Cheese platter was also good and there‚Äôs more variety to choose from.

Bigger place and cozy ambience. We liked the atmosphere, just that my friend is a little bit uncomfortable with that high chair outside.

Service was great. Big thumbs up to Shiva for his fast and efficient service! Attentive and very accommodating and always wears a smile.

Highly recommended to locals and travellers.

Will definitely come again!"
Recommended,"Great place! Affordable prices for dinner with families or friends. Great ambiance! And also very friendly waiters and waitresses. The one who attended to me, his name is Shiva. Great service provided by him. Kudos to the team!"
Excellent services,"Will like to give a thumbs up for Jia Hao, always good, efficient and remember what we preferred and ordered always . never once fail our expectations, even give us good recommendations from the menus

Is a great place for lunch around Robertson quay where we always patrol during lunch. Food are good and constant , highly recommended!"
Excellent Service,"Would like to commend Jiahao, Shiva and Shah for their excellent service. They are very attentive and always make the conscious effort to make sure that their customers needs are met. Good food and great collection of wine too! Will definitely be back for more!"
Not bad for the last meal of 2020,"This is a sure to go place. Not our first time and we were looking for an impromptu change to our prior engagement that cancelled. We tried our 'luck' by walking in at 730pm. Thankfully they were able to seat us. Service throughout the night was prompt and food was dishing out at a good pace. We were stuffed with 10 dishes, a bottle of prosecco, 2 glasses of rose and champagne. What a way to celebrate NYE!"
"Great team, good food and wines","Good food and very reasonably priced wines. Ambience was cosy. Busy on a Tuesday night but all servers were upbeat, attentive, polite and prompt in rendering service. Special mention to Gurjit - he was polite (always replying us with ‚ÄúYou are welcome‚Äù whenever we thank him) and very hospitable. You have got a great team at Wine Connection Robertson Quay! Looking forward to our next visit!"
Wonderful food and great service,"Was told reservations full and had to walk in which we did and was given a table quite quickly. It was a Thursday evening. Food was great, the cold meat platter goes delightfully with the wine. We had several starters, eggplant and grilled prawns was our favourites, for mains we had the meat platter which was awesome. The steak and lamb chops were grilled to perfection and very generous in their portions. The wine was very good, we had the Trivento Reserve and some cocktail. The pina colada I ordered was a little bit too sweet and too strong for me, otherwise all good. The crew was friendly and service was good and fast. Would definitely visit again."
Great staff,Superb food and drink. Great service. Staff Pamela was very attentive to us.We had a blast on our weekend girls night out. Will definitely come back
Good place for Gathering,"Good place for Gathering
Try the mixed platter set, Soda, sweet wine
Mostly reasonable price
Friendly helpful staff"
TGIF with le Girlfriends,"TGIF EVERYONE!
Planned the outing for weeks and it certainly didn‚Äôt disappoint!
So glad we managed to book a table otherwise who knows how long we‚Äôd be waiting for.. Gotten ourselves a perfect little corner!
Pamela definitely deserves a shoutout!
She‚Äôs friendly and took real good care of our table. Food and wine was on great, tasty as always!
There was another lady w tat (loved her tat btw) she made sure our wine glasses was always filled, never empty!
A little delay on one of the mains but the place was packed with people, so was understandable.
We girls definitely enjoyed ourselves, so thank you!

Will I come back? Hell YES!

Food - 5/5
Service - 5/5
Ambiance 5/5
Value for money - 5/5"
Attentive staff,Was here a few weeks with my friend and we were both very impressed by server Jane. She was friendly and attentive and even remembered that we wanted to have our cheese later. Kudos to the rest of staffs for the hardwork too!
Lovee Winessss üç∑,"Missed this place, finally after the long CB. Cheap wine place in singapore! worth the money evertime i visit. affordable food w/ quality, affordable variety of wines and the ambiance are cozy and cool. strict measure at this time of period. will kick you out at 10:30pm early close compare to last time 3am."
So nice,Brought a friend for brunch. Ended up with little food but lots of wine. Great service and reasonably priced wine. One if my favourite place for a casual outing
Visited by the tagliatelle police,"Decided to go to enjoy a little tapas or two but the tapas had been suspended for the next month! Absolutely not a problem, we will enjoy a main course from the menu.
After seeing the lovely plate of pig cheeks and tagliatelle on the menu l could see straight away that this had my name on it!
Let me put it like this...if you are going to advertise a large plate with a mountain of tagliatelle on it surrounded by meat then obviously that is what l am expecting to get!! In reality a dessert bow,l when even held up to eye level you wouldn't have been able to guess what was in it that was presented.
C'mon guys if you are gonna chop the portions then at least chop the prices!!
We understand that everyone is feeling the pinch right now but two tablespoons of pasta is a little too much to bear, l can buy a whole bag retail for $4 so wholesale you could have easily thrown a whole bag on my plate and still made a profit but to charge me $26 for the privilege is really not on. Free water, amazing, champagne at $10 a glass, amazing but portion sizes when compared to what is advertised, an absolute joke!"
Evening,"Just around the corner we found this lovely Wine bar, a selection of cheese and wine to die for, we went two nights running due to our length of stay, nice bottle of New zealand sauvignon with a nice selection of cheeses, reasonable price a lovely area, a must for wine & cheese lovers"
Excellent servixe,Jiahao has been the most thoughtful and wonderful service staff at wine connection. It is this type of service that brings me back to this place again and again. üëç
Good atmosphere but the food is so-and-so,The atmosphere of the bsitro is very nice and is suitable for a large crowd having fun. The wine selection is very good. I would say that it will be better if they improve the quality of the food.
"Noisy, fast and fantastic.","A great restaurant and bar, the food is excellent, wine list extensive and very, very reasonably priced. The service is friendly and fast, has a good social buzz. Would highly recommend to visit, eat and drink."
Zero service,"Average food, the truffle mushroom pasta is kinda of disappointing.

The service crew only seem to have eyes for ladies, I had to wait for only half an hour for plain water to be refilled.

Disappointing."
"Good food, bad service","The food is good, especially the pizza. The desserts are average. But the service is so bad if you are sitting outside. We ordered the food, 5 min later we got the drinks, then 5 min later we got the cutlery. 10 min later no food was yet on the table, we asked the waiter and then he got us empty plates and a few minutes later the appetizers. 10 min after that, food was still not here, we asked another waiter for the food and everything came but they were already mild temperature which means they were sitting inside and our waiter didn't bother checking. Then we ordered dessert, when they brought them they didn't bother taking the empty pizza and salad plates so we moved them ourselves to another table. We looked for someone to ask for spoons, no one around for a few minutes so we went and got them ourselves. Really bad service!!"
Bad attitude,"Just this evening, my friend and I were there for dinner at 7pm. The staff at the reception was unwelcoming and rude when we made a tiny request to look for a table for two that is probably a little more conducive to have conversation within the restaurant. I felt that the reception staff and the manager could have suggested where to seat us within the restaurant or they should have dealt with the situation with more tact rather than to turn away potential customers by being blatantly rude to exclaim that there will be No seats that will be less noisy."
Good service rendered,"Not my first time to wine connection, but this is the first time i received such a nice service. Would like to compliment service rendered by Clynston. Attentive to detail on a busy saturday night. Wine and water timely topped up. Good nice conversation engaged. Good job wine connection. Surely we will be back."
Tapas and beer,Came back here again last month for a selection of tapas and a few beers. Always good value here and the service is efficient and friendly. Reasonable prices for alcohol too.
Lunch,Had lunch and ordered rib eye and glass of wine when I got my glass of red wine the glass is dirty so I ask to replace for a new one what the bar man did just pour it in a different glass he never realised I was just in front of him . He could‚Äôve give me a fresh one the barman should‚Äôve educate on giving service to the guest
Robertson outlet - staff Kati,"Look for him for his service and recommendation when you're there.

Superd service, attentive coming back to us a few times to ensure if we're happy with his recommendation and provided suggestions in the way best savour the cheese and wine.

Excellent recommendation in finding cheese types to my preference.

Very friendly and always wears a smile!

Thank you for making our Friday night awesome!"
Fantastic selection of wine and great tapas,We ate here more than once because it was a great place for all the family and the wines on offer were excellent and very reasonably priced for Singapore! The location is lovely too and you can talk a walk along the river before or after too.
yummy foods and good wine,"Have bee come here quite often.
Lamb dish is real Yummy. Pasta is good but nothing stand out as my friend said. Service is not really good. As we have to Wait for long for the main dis coming. But the bill come after the main dish arrive. Also asked several Time when the foods come but seem not help.
The rest was good, good location, many bars restaurants around and the river."
Great selection,"Sitting outside for drinks doesn‚Äôt seem like the best idea in the Singapore heat, but the upbeat yet cool vibes of this place gives a good ambiance to socialize.

The servers are friendly and attentive. We tried a Chilean wine which went down very smoothly and perhaps much too quickly that we had to get another bottle.

The selection of beer is pretty impressive too."
nice place to chill or even business meeting,"food here is nice and tasty, wine selection is great! just enjoy coming here again. Good ambiance, not too loud and you can have a decent chat with your friends, table setting isn't too close to one another, some privacy for you and your friend to enjoy your meal."
Outstanding,"Great venue , feels like a big bar but the service and attention is great . Great food , the ribs are amazing . As the name suggests the wine list is extensive in range and price and is categorised in a novel way by price that works . Only small criticism is the music was a little too loud"
Good food,Food and staff was great and was able to check other preference of food and suggests dishes that is capable for our dietary restrictions . Drinks we‚Äôre good also and even a bit busy they manage to serve what ever is ready for us.
Delicious Dishes,"I had supper at this place for the first time and am very pleased. Fast service, variety to choose from and kool spot to hang with friends."
"Ah, Wonderful, Far from the Maddening Crowd","What an innovative, stylish, ambient nook to find. A luncheon treat of European cheeses, with wines from many countries, well priced for sure.

A 3 cheese platter with fruit and quality plus grainy rolls was perfect. If you have had enough of noodles, rice and one bowl hot pots, Wine Connection might also be heaven for you as it was for me."
Fathers Day celebration,"Brought my wife + 2 teenage boys to Wine Connection Bistro & Tapas Bar, 1st time for three of them. Great food + wine + company, bill came up to S$220 incl a bottle of Italian Red ... Reasonable price & speedy service!"
Very poor service.,The service was so poor that we'll never come back again. Time for waiting for dishes was so long. Not recommended at all!!
Great tapas,Found this gem wondering the Unity Street area for dinner on arrival in Singapore. Very large restaurant was close to full on a Saturday night. We had 4 of the tapas items to share between 2 of us...it was plenty. On the night we could have had a selection of 6 items for S$45 which was good deal. Service was good but had to wait a little while for hostess to come back and seat us.
Great wine advice and food was also a good standard,"Had dinner here last night.

My business associate and I looking for a resturant with a good selection of wines and a good steak.

Wine connection got it right.

I generally only drink AUSSIE wines of a mid to higher price point.

We couldn‚Äôt quiet find something in the Aussie selection so the waiter recommended a Italian red close to a Syrah.

His recommendation was excellent. I can‚Äôt remember his name but his service was excellent all night.

Good selection of food. Steak was tender and well cooked and very good value.

Good atmosphere and nice standard of clientele.

Overall a good dining experience"
Lovely evening!,"Had an amazing evening here! Delicious food, friendly staff, good prices for everything, overall really impressed and would definitely return :)"
Tastebuds,"I and my girlfriend went here since i'd like to try out their wine. The wine that we've ordered is just so nice to our taste, the food is not that so appetizing but still okay. But their staff is friendly and accommodating. Good service guys!"
"Great food, great wine, and great staff!","Ate here twice during my trip sat at the bar the tapas are very tasty and they have a huge range of wines. The staff at the bar a great fun and provide a great service. I recommend the 6 tapas for $45 if there‚Äôs two of you, also a great Rioja for just $9 a glass"
Wine still good; food has become disappointing; friendly staff,"I enjoyed the wide selection of wine by the glass at sensible prices; I have my favourites and from time to time I experiment with the other wines.

I ate the Tuna Tataki salad - a generous portion of salad that was good as a main course. On my previous visit I ate the Spanish-style gambas ‚Äì another tasty dish.

I've been dining here since the day the Tapas Bar opened, and nowadays I'm distinctly disappointed to discover that almost all of my favourite dishes have been discontinued over the years:
‚Äì trio of mini-quiches
‚Äì mozzarella sticks
‚Äì baby calamari
‚Äì duck leg confit
‚Äì shoulder of lamb
‚Äì wasabi prawns
‚Äì hoisin duck wrap
‚Äì salmon ceviche

By the way, I would welcome the return of that splendid M√¢con-Villages by the glass that I was drinking in 2012.

The serving staff are friendly and efficient."
Very pricey red wine served cold,"Very cosy looking wine and cheese bar but with a very expensive price tag on both very average bottles of wine and average typically cheap cheese European cheese.

$9 for a few chunks of one type of average french cheese.

Lacks the service and finesse for the price tag it has (even in Singapore)"
Extremely POOR experience.,"On the website, it states a number to call for reservations. Why put a phone number if you don‚Äôt plan on picking up the phone in the first place? Not just once or twice. But rather over a period of 3 days. From Thursday to Saturday, we called the place over 50 times at different timings just to place a reservation for 5 on Saturday at 6pm. Literally. For a place with such a branding, I must say it‚Äôs a joke. A big joke and a slap in the face of the customer to be so poor in this regard.
Upon arriving, I notice several tables that are reserved with signage and all westerners occupying these tables. Of course I understand that a place such as this is catered dominantly to westerners. But still. #isitbecauseimchinese
However being objective, the local staff‚Äôs service was still helpful. Not the same can be said for the westerner staff. Overall. If you‚Äôre Asian and looking to have some cheese, wine and some Italian fare, and feel like a 2nd class citizen in your own country, feel free to visit this place at the risk of your soaring blood pressure."
"Good steak, but..","Wine connection restaurant is one of the many restaurants on this street.
Restaurant looks nice and is quite popular at evenings.
Good service and good food. I liked my steak, but BBQ sauce was not home made, and I was hoping to get better french fries than frozen ones."
"Nice, small portions","We had a nice evening over there. It was quite expensive and our 6 tapas were so small so we ordered 2 more tapas and a salad. Red wine was ok.
Good service and the excellent location.
Highly recommended"
Good variety of cheese and wine,They have a quite a wide range of cheese and at different timing they have different cheese promotion. Thus will recommend people who love cheese like raclette and fondue. Their wine is great too and at some attractive prices
Valentines dinner was marred,I brought my wife to Wine Connection Tapas Bar and Bistro for an early Valentine‚Äôs Day dinner. The salad of burrata cheese was runny and the paella has rice which was not cooked yet burnt at the bottom. Only saving grace was the wine!
Ill trained,A poor bottle of wine - a thin and bitter medoc. Ok. But when I do not drink it and spend money ordering a chianti - you should take it off the bill - if you are properly trained - a clearly the Robertson Quay bartender was poorly trained.
Sat outside and had a great meal with a colleague,"We were after something close to Chinatown. We found this place at Robertsons Walk. Decided to sit outside and watch the world and have a meal and a bottle of wine - you goto the bottle shop, make your choice and the prices are reasonable and the food excellent. Service attentive."
Great!,A great atmosphere and a lovely bar with little bits and great drinks. Very convenient in a great area.
Good tapas offer and reasonable wine,"Went here for some tapas dinner, as my wife and I were not very hungry. Music is quite loud and not all the waiters are attentive. However, there was a special offer on 6 tapas for 45 SGD, which provided excellent choice. We had two glasses of red wine, of which the Rioja was by far the most palatable. OK for quick meal but not my favorite."
Tasty,"Lovely food, great service. Good wine which I supposed one could expect. Loved the two meals we had."
Great find,This bar was just stone throw from our hotel and we visited it twice as the cheese and wine selection was great would recommend Baked Camembert was delicious
Wallet friendly Dining Experience,"No doubt Singapore has one of the highest, if not the highest taxes on Alcohol, so if you find a good place, you end up heading there all the time!

I became a regular for a few good reasons.
- Wide variety of quality wines,
- Tasty food for the small and hearty appetites
- Great for small and big groups (very accommodating)
- TOP service (go all out to ensure you have a wonderful and cosy dining experience)!

Special mention to Jia Hao, the Manager whom I still don't know your name, Tirul, the Uncle who always bring us our absurd amounts of Chilli Padi etc..

All these going for the PRICE which doesn't burn a whole in your pocket!

Pretty GOOD DEAL, won't you agree?"
Poor Service and Ordinary Wines,"The service has been poor at wine connection - Novena. Even after buying a bottle of wine, no serving staff came to pour the wine after opening, no top-up for water, one of the two dishes was served half an hour after serving the first one. We didn‚Äôt finish the bottle of wine so wanted to take it back home. No serving staff offered a cork or a bag to carry it back."
Great service and Ambience!,"I‚Äôm a regular here for some years now.
A shout out to Iris, She‚Äôs always so attentive and mindful of the requests made through the night! Always happy to see her!"
New Year Eve,Fantastic service and commendation to service staff Jia Hao. He is attentive and approachable. This place is has been a regular from a long time ago.
Guys - What‚Äôs Happened to the Tapas?,"One of our favorite spots to wine and dine so when in doubt we head over to Robertson Walk.
Last night was a casual dining night for wife and I so ordered the wine and decided on tapas for dinner.
We had enjoyed tapas and the cheese/cold cut platters when needing more food but tonight was tapas only.
6 items off the menu were quickly served but this is where the fun ended.
3 of the chosen dishes were not enjoyable at all- Chicken Tikka was pasty and so salty(maybe a way to drink more?)...
Fish taco - sorry should be known as cheesy bite with some fish.
The spicy calamari was rubber - had to have been reheated.
Stick to the olives, beef balls and ceviche..
Service was good and as always - the star is the wine selection."
Big negativ surprise,"Very bad service, request wine by glas (as they offer) received a very rude impolite answear:SOLD OUT. Excuse me, and waiter reply with a tone of voice like ""not understood?"" SOLD OUT!!! and only to don't open a bottle for a single client.
Same wine as bottle available in the place as well by Cheese bistro and in a store by Raffles City. It's true service people can do the difference like in a Wine Connection Cheese (20 mt. away!!) where all service very professional and kind."
"Good Wine, nice atmosphere","Went to wine connection last night as didn‚Äôt want a heavy meal. The six tapas dishes for 6 was perfect for two people and food was nice and tasty to have with a couple of bottles of wine. Open late which was ideal after arriving late into Singapore.
Service good and quick
Worth a try for sure"
Good value for money,"Goof value for money - food is well cooked, wines are reasonably priced. Drinks are below average and service staff could be better trained."
BDay makan,"Brought my 80year old to try out Western food / Wine @Robertson quay branch.
Booked a table for 2 @1630hr via Eatigo with 50% discount, restaurant space was huge with only <15diners at that time.
Ordered a Cold Cut Platter, Fish & Chip, Tenderloin Steak and 2 glasses of Red Wine, total bill came up to S$55/=. Good value meal!
Food was , Steak was perfectly done @medium rare.....
Will certainly return for more!"
Wonderful place,"This place is amazing. Wonderful staff with amazing food, wine, and atmosphere. Everyone is very friendly and accommodating. This visit, Jai Hoa was great! Thank you for a wonderful day!"
Unsympathetic staff,"Don't expect to be able to call them to extend a reservation if you are running late. Tried calling 3 times, no answer. Got there 20 minutes late, no sympathy from the staff at all. So we left."
Nice wine bar,Nice wine bar with modern decor and seating outside. Good choice of wines by the glass and not too expensive. However service was very slow.
Birthday Dinner,Thanks for the excellent food with nice atmosphere. Many thanks for Good looking guy Mr. Dude too. ;-)
Felt like a punishment for booking with Eatigo app!,"At the entrance, at the waiting area, I told the host that we had a reservation w eatigo. She asked for de code, so I show it to her, she took down de bookin code. We were regulars in tis place before many times without using this Eatigo app, to our curiosity upon eatigo app refered, the dining experience was unpleasant and disappointing, we felt like we were punished. We had book for 6:30pm and we had reached 6:15pm, the host told us that she only have tall tables, i replied to her im ok to wait for the next available low table, then we were brought to a cramp table. This is the first unpleasant start, so I had insisted to have a table at the wall along the walk way. The hostress insisted that all 2 paxs tables at the walk way are fully book for the night. I saw 1 table without the reserve tag, and requested for this table, she insisted that this is also reserved as she does not have additional tag to place on the table. Then I saw that a guest was about to leave so i ask for the table after they clean up. The moment we sat down, we were asked again to show the booking code to the hostress that she had took the booking code before. Upon sitting down on our table, we were told by a waitress that the eatigo promotion for our meal and table is only 1 hr. We were rather shocked to hear this, this is the 2nd unpleasant experience we had. We went ahead to order the meal and a bottle of White Wine. And for the 3rd time the waitress came to ask to show her our eatigo booking code! Then i saw in this booking, In the terms and condition of this place in the Eatigo app, it did not state that by using eatigo booking we were allow only an hour to dine. During our meals the waitress came to fill our wine from our bottle a few times, that was really nice and we had forgotten those 2 unpleasant experience we had eariler and continue to eat our food and have our drinks. After our meal we wanted to rest abit before ordering our dessert and continued to chit chat abit and have our wine. There were still wine on our glasses so the same waitress came to our table, wanting to fill our glasses from our bottle. Upon noticing that our glasses is still full, the waitress continued to fill it and commented that my friend's glass of wine is feeding gold fishes and she should drink it and not feed gold fishes, she then divert her conversation n ask if we want the bill nw. Tis the 3rd bad experience we had in 1 bookin fr eatigo. As regulars in this plc. We did not experience such treatment before such as time limit for our table. Both of us felt that its like a outcast for using eatigo to book with a 10% discount. Does tis 10% discount make as any different like any other dinners without this discount. We had stay from 6:30pm to 8:30pm and to our surprise those tables along the walkway were empty since we sat down, claimed by the host tat all the low tables are all fully book for the night especially those along the walkway. If I knew that we will have such unpleasant dining on a sat nite, i would rather not book using eatigo or even choose this place with such rude service. We had ordered Tapas, I had remembered the tapas was nice and tasty before, in our visit the tapas was cold and awful."
cheap wine but bad service,"We had some drinks (4 bottles of wine plus a few glasses), some were quite good, some were not very good, but for the price we don't expect it to be perfect. But the service was really lacking. When asked questions about the different types of rose, you could clearly see that the waiter had no clue. Then when we order a bottle of different rose another waiter poured the new wine in the old glass (mixed with previous bad rose wine).
Finally at 1.15am we were asked for last order and shortly after asked to pay because they were closing at 2am when their website clearly says saturday closing:3am and last order 1hour before closing time which to me means 2am! I guess they just wanted to go home early.
First and last time in this bar."
they don't listen to the customer,"My friend and I came here for some beers and tapas and ordered our first Belgium beers...but were told only one was available, actually we got three answers from three different people but that ended up being the answer...why? because the pipes were not ready...why not? you've had all day.....

then we ordered a different Belgium beer which came in Peroni glasses....we complained and said why are they serving Belgium beers in Italian beer glasses? They said it was because it was the only glass they had!

so we said please can you not do that

we ordered more Belgium beers...they came in Peroni glasses again! we couldn't believe it....complained again....

same answer

then again...and again in Peroni glasses...this time they said the beer we ordered only had half glasses that were branded but the Peroni glass could fit it all!

unbelievable! Peroni were getting all this branding and we were not even ordering their beer

so I asked for the half glass and poured by beer from the wrong Peroni one into the right branded half one

this was symptomatic of the customer service and attention to detail at this restaurant which points to no training and no briefing

on the plus side the tapas were nice...especially the duck"
Awful food and dying atmosphere,"Decided to drop by Wine Connection for dinner and a drink. This used to be a very good spot to chill out with a lively crowd in a great area. Things are very different now. Wine Connection wasn‚Äôt so busy and Robertson Quay looked very run down, or as others would say ‚Äúcharming‚Äù, with very little people. Now, the food is where I am very disappointed. They used to serve decent Tapas and meats. However, my T-Bone steak was just awful. It was so chewy and flavorless that I could not eat it. The fries that came with the steak was of the highly processed cheap stuff and was powdery. Tapas was not fresh at all and it was obvious that the source ingredients weren‚Äôt of high quality. I also had pizza. It was so bad that I would‚Äôve done better with a microwaved one from 7-Eleven. I don‚Äôt know why people like this place or what they consider good food. It probably explains why many restaurants are still in business without needing to lift their game."
Awesome,Loveeeee wine connection! It‚Äôs the best place to get great quality wine and the most value for money! Robertson quay‚Äôs the best because of the great service from Jude! Thanks for making it such a pleasant meal. Really appreciate it! Thanks man!
Wine Connection Robertson Walk,"Well its a nice place. The food is good, the service is good...maybe because of its size its lacking personality but it was good. The wine selection its not that good however.. More or less low to midl wines/champagnes, which considering the name of the place is disappointed..Overall good time and will return again."
Good wine,"We had just arrived in Singapore and we needed some food before we got an early night. Near our hotel was Robertson quay and we saw wine connection. We ordered the 4 special tapas dishes which were meatballs, cheese parcels, mussels and skewers. They were each 9 dollars. The mussels were our favourite. We had a bottle of wine to accompany our tapas which was lovely and reasonably priced."
Nice tapas,"Recommended by someone who lives in Singapore. Really nice place - Robertson quay is cool.

Tapas and steak was nice. Some dishes just OK e.g. fish tacos very plain but some very good e.g. steak, hoisin duck rolls.

Would go again."
Good choice for a mid size event,I returned here recently for drinks organised for a colleague who was departing. It's a good choice of venue for a mid size event: reasonable prices and good quality food and drink. Decent atmosphere even on week nights. Will be back again before too long I'm sure.
Great find if you like wine,"OK we all know that food is cheap in Singapore but wine is ridiculously expensive and we love wine. This place is the answer good food and service with wine at retail prices. All I can say is we visited 3 times in two days what n
Better recommendation can I give."
Good value lunch set in beautiful Robertson Quay,"A group of girlfriends and I enjoyed lunch here today. The set menu of an entree plus a soup, salad or dessert for $18 SGD was a great value. They have a cool promotion right now which includes an interesting Latin Fiesta theme with a flight of five Spanish/Argentinian wines for $19.95. The food is solid and the servers keep your water glass filled, a must in the heat of Singapore!"
Upmarket trendy wine bar,We found the wine bar very trendy with an excellent choice of wines and tapas. Pity we didn'y have time to visit a second time !
Cheese Platter!!,Gorgeous food! The cheese platter and wine selection is to die for and not too pricey for cheese! Would highly recommend
