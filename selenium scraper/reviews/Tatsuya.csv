Tatsuya,The sushi is fresh and I like the their shop Caviar. It is very delicious. . The resturant is clean and neat. The staff is very friendly too
Food 8/10 overall experience 6/10,"It’s a classic without a doubt and I hope it’s still here in 50 years, fantastic sushi bar food but the prices for mediocre service, ambience and the somewhat dated feel (very 1990/2000) don’t justify the 800-1400 prices.

Yes, we visit again, it amazing but massively over priced for the standard of service and overall ambiance."
Way overpriced (now),"Used to frequent this joint some years back - before covid. Set lunches then were reasonably priced at about $45 - $60. Went back recently, and to my horror, the set lunch price has been revised to $100. You would have thought there would be a better revised menu, but sadly, the same old tiny sushi with just some minor additions, and removal of other stuff from the previous menu. Food is nothing fantastic. This is the last time I am going back there. At $100 per set lunch, there are plenty of Jap dining places that serve much better food."
ridiculously over priced for omakase and they serve salmon aburi inside $370 omakese,"atmosphere =like hawker center, wet mkt kind (so busy and loud, takes forever to get staff's attention
price for food ($350-$370 omakase) = way overpriced, what kind of 5 star hotel japanese restaurant who charges $350 for omakese serves salmon aburi sushi and over flavored katsuobushi fish flakes on the top of sashimi.
I ordered sake and they served differnt sake from what i ordered which almost coasted double the price yet nobody informed me. (only realised when I got the bill)"
Incredible food,"Took my client here for business lunch, pre-booked the place in advance as this is a small and authentic place. My second visit, somehow I had is a lot more impressive meal than the first (I can’t recall what I got). Aburi set I chose this time was incredible, every item was melt in the mouth experience. My contact chose the normal sushi set (also $100++) and commented that she thinks the food was nicer 10 years ago when she had last visited.

I’ll definitely come back for the Aburi set !! Impressive dining experience and service as well. Thank you!!"
The “tare” sauce was an overkill n too salty!,"Ordered the premium Teppanyaki set (dinner) for lunch. Scallops, crayfish, beef all came too salty which kills the entire unami. Sliced garlic came in a tub n placed on our plates (soften) n not fragrant nor crispy. Fried garlic rice pre-prepared n given right at e start of the meal! Not even like warm with spring onions garnished on them. Only tasty stuff were the sashimi n miso soup. Even the bean sprout was too salty! The show of sprinkling pepper etc whilst cooking is far too noisy! Maybe due to e need to show, salt is sprinkled more than required!
The old Tatsuya quality n taste is no longer there unfortunately…"
"Average food, lofty price","Let’s put it this way.
I’ve been to many other Japanese restaurants in Singapore that offer similar if not more delectable food at easily 30 per cent to 50 per cent cheaper compared with this restaurant.
Yes, I can see the many photos of dignitaries dining here adorn the walls, but I can’t help but question why after a dismal lunch.
Maybe my taste buds aren’t as sophisticated."
Dinner at Tatsuya Japanese restaurant at Goodwood Park hotel,"Dinner at Tatsutya Japanese restaurant at Goodwood Park hotel.

We have dinner on 1st Oct 2021 at Tatsuya Japanese restaurant and selected their premium Omakase dinner set.

We noticed that the chefs were busy entertaining the regular customers drinking and talking loudly.

When we were served with the dishes from the Omakase set, the chef didn’t bother to introduce the dishes ?

They seemed to lose their concentration serving the dishes probably because they were drinking too much and talking to much with the regular guests in particular lady guests.

Unfortunately the food quality is average and is not superb considering the price range of the Omakase set.

Indeed I will think twice about going back to Tatsuya again."
Yum!,"We had a great night there, the food was exquisite, the atmosphere was great. It wasn’t as expensive as we feared but the dishes were quite small. We will def go back though, overall a really enjoyable experience."
Overly Priced - For What!?,"I found that the price of $280 set menu per person were rather expensive and I'm unsure if I can finish them. So, my partner told the waiter that we do not want to pay too much for the food (there were 8 items), and he recommended chef menu, with 2 lesser items than the actual menu stated. Our big mistake for not checking the price clearly. And guess what!? They charged us $260 for that ($20 less - what a joke). So, do check the price first before ordering.

Am I happy with the food? I love Japanese food and have eaten at a lot of good Japanese restaurants, with fraction of the price. The food was tasty, but so do other Japanese restaurants I've visited. I wonder what they charge more for? The servings? The ambience? The location? The service? Certainly not the best.

I would probably not come back here, and will advise friends and acquaintances the same. Tatsuya did not seem like a good value place, given the prices."
Indescribably Nice!,"Went to Tatsuya on Friday evening, we made reservations last mins but luckily they managed to give us table for two.
We ordered the mixtures of sushi for one, salmon sashimi and some grill cod fish. It taste so really excellent... not only the foods,
but the service was so good, everyone friendly...one of the young lady who keep take note of our table (i forgot her name) and made sure our tea full, she’s so kind and provides amazing service!!
We really enjoyed our Friday evening, will sure comes back again for more.."
Intimate Japanese Sushi Restaurant,"We went to this restaurant for our 2 year anniversary and it met our expectations. The sushi is made in front of you from fresh ingredients and the chefs interact with you and assist you in any selections you want to make.

The service was impeccable with constant attention to our needs.

Although a bit pricey, it was well worth it for our anniversary outing."
We had a delicious lunch here.,"We had a delicious lunch here. Sat at the sushi bar, we opted for 2 of the set lunch menus. Every course of the set lunch impressed, the sushi was exquisite. This combined with great service and the live preparation at the bar made the whole experience a delight. I highly recommend dining here. I will be back for more!"
one of the better Omakase restaurants in SG,"Thank you Chef Sasaki! 3rd time having their dinner omakase, fresh and authentic japanese taste. The mentaiko geoduck was really good!"
Fine Japanese cuisine with tints of fusion,"I took my guest to Tatsuya and reserved a table and ordered omakase. It’s a full course that is a bit too much food but every bit satisfying. From aperitif to sashimi, aburi sushi to wagyu, all food are fresh and well presented. The food incorporates some ingredients that are slightly strong in flavor such as a string of fresh ginger, strands of Chinese herb, mint flowers and leaves as highlighted flavor without covering the original tastes of the raw material. The dinner ended with refreshing melon pieces. The service was attentive but not intrusive. Chef came to greet without imposing and a day later the restaurant sent a text message to thank customers."
"Not a fan of Japanese cuisine, went for the experience (which didn't happen).","Not being particularly fond of Japanese cuisine, yet I was persuaded to go for the experience as my grand children simply love Sushi and the associated Japanese food.
Hardly found anything which I could enjoy except for a chicken dish or two, which too was not particularly worth paying a King's ransom for. The chef was quite friendly and enjoyed being photographed. Frankly, I would not go again. You need a specially developed palate for this food, which I don't have.
Experience was Okay as we were seated at a table (Children are apparently not allowed to see the food being prepared in front of them). Perhaps, I would have enjoyed the experience more, had I been able to see the food prepared in front of me.

Am giving 4 stars as the family liked the food."
Not great,"Somehow i do not feel Tatsuya to be as good as before. I noticed that the chefs are not friendly. But the staff are still good.I do not like that the sushi is made all at once and presented to us on a plate though we are seated at the counter. Other sushi places give more personalized attention especially when you are not paying low prices, you would expect SERVICE. Food taste wise, it is still ok, but not incredible. Been there, done that, so i guess I will probably not be back for me."
Average,"We were strongly recommended to go to this place whilst in Singapore.
Our expectations were high.
What a disappointment...
first of all the place is freezing cold ... you need a winter coat at least to feel comfortable.... the food is good . The service is very average .... certainly not the best Japanese in Singapore .... nobody in the Restaurant is Japanese ... not even the Manager/owner ... the price is outrageously expensive ..... now we understand why the owner drives a Lamborghini parked outside ..."
My go-to for Japanese in Singapore,"I had the omakase last year and two lunches two day in a row this year. The omakase was so good: comforting and delicious. Lunch bentos were of very good value: delicious, cheap and well-portioned.

Service was excellent and friendly. The staffs were more than kind, helping my mother to her seat from her wheelchair through the steps."
Excellent set menu,"Super sushi set during week day lunch. Fresh and nice. Rather crowded, due to the good food. Ordered the cheaper set, will try the higher end sets next time."
Amazing place excellente experience,"I come here after e months and must admit all was perfect!food super fresh especially sushimi, terennce our chef super nice, sushi great and warm food very detailed! We had a menu and out of japan one of ny favourite places althought pricy! Will come back!"
A treat indeed,"Saturday night at this very busy Japanese Sushi bar.
Highly experienced chefs prepare fantastic Sushi Sashimi and other delicacies in front of your eyes.
A great experience delivering a night out with a buzz.
One of the best in my experience.
Not cheap but the food and ambience are worth it.
Down sides some wait staff appear pushy need to rush you or oversell.
Toilets are very disappointing two cubicles for the entire restaurant for male and female resembling something the size of a broom closet."
Very enjoyable experience,"Our family thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, with good food, cheerful atmosphere, and warm staff . Chef Chen Su is very professional, friendly and attentive to our preference and needs. He even arranged a surprise birthday song singing for my Daughter when he overheard us talking about it. Thank you!"
Good food!!,"This is a Japanese Restaurant located next to Goodwood at Scotts road.
I had no surprise when entered the restaurant and found at the seating capacity only around 30-40 seats (including private room), and luckily we booked the seat prior. Open for lunch and dinner only, the food tastes superb, good quality of raw materials."
Outstanding service and quality food,This restaurant is located in the beautiful old building of Goodwood hotel. The restaurant itself is small and expect to be packed next to your neighbours unless you book one of the few tables ahead of time. Great quality and excellent service.
Superior taste but expensive,"We found Tatsuya from trioadvisor app.
It was very clıse to our hotel just 5 min far by walking.
Taste is really high level something like michelin recommended. It is bit far from downtown and harbour.
Location 3 of 5
Taste 5 of 5
Price is over value
Staff 5 of 5
View, ambiance 4 of 5"
"So good, the food is amazing, but not really a family place,","So good, the food is amazing and the atmosphere is really nice. I really recommend the sushi bar because it is very cool how the chefs make it and it is entergIning"
Great sashimi and excellent service,"My longtime favourite japanese restaurant in Singapore..
Visited for lunch and was seated at the Sushi bar right opposite the japanese sushi chef sasha.. he was busy carving a horse mackerel called sobo in japanese..
Ordered Otoro ( tuna belly) and fatty salmon sashimi which were delicious..
Carpaccio of hamachi with truffle oil and caviar was heavenly
Also had some super veggie japanese salad of avocado, lettuce and japanese pear with jaoanese seasoning on the side..
Japanese matcha tea was a great choice..
First time i ate the famed japanese fruit tomato which was so succulent.. see pic below..
Very satisfying.. tables are usually full at 1 pm but the last order is at 2 pm.. the restaurant located at the iconic goodwood hotel on scotts road opens for lunch at 12 pm..
Be there early to get a seat at the sushi bar.. waiters are well trained and will help order if you are not familiar with the menu..
Here are some pics of what i usually eat here"
Best meal,I was not a sushi fan until I ate at this restaurant. This was one of my best meals ever. I strongly recommend this restaurant to everyone. They will cook your meat even if it’s normally served raw. My brother told me that some people will have an extra layover so that they can go to this restaurant during their travels.
Good food and service,Fresh sashmimi and great service from staff. Staff even recommended food which were off the menu! Will definitely be back again!
"Eye-poppingly, astoundingly expensive; good (not amazing) quality","S$572 (US$423) for two people, including a bottle of sake for S$210 (US$154). One portion of seabream sashimi comprises six beautifully cut, thin (almost transparent), small pieces for a princely US$44. US$32 for four pieces of tuna sushi (not otoro). You get the idea - very highly priced. I've posted a photo of the bill so you can decide for yourself whether I am being fair in saying that this is astoundingly expensive, even by the usually pricy standard for higher quality Japanese restaurants.

By the way, the prices are not because the fish is flown in fresh every day from Tokyo. I asked and was told the fish is delivered twice a week. I eat sashimi in Boulder, Colorado at an izakaya (Amu Sake Bar) that receives fresh fish every day from Tokyo: one might think that a top end restaurant in Singapore could manage the same.

The quality of the fish was high. The preparation/presentation was nice, though not amazing.

The sake list is short and not comprehensive. There was little choice and I did not find even one junmai daiginjo on the dryer side (+3 or higher on the scale).

Service was pleasant and reasonably attentive.

Be warned: the air-conditioning is absolutely fierce! It was so cold that I accepted the offer of a ladies' shawl just to stay comfortable."
Enjoyed our lunch,"Treated ourselves to a nice enjoyable lunch at Tatsuya. I just mention that Tatsuya is actually outside the hotel and does not seem part of Goodwood Park Hotel. Service is good. We sat at the sushi counter and I must say that it is a long counter about 24 seater. Ordered the popular Aburi set lunch and also the famous beef don. If you do not like your fish raw, the Aburi would be a great choice. The beef don comes in various sizes and we chose the smallest. It is pricy but worth the price as the tender and moist beef literally melts in the mouth. Will come back again next time to try out other dishes."
Love the food!,"Brought my friend here for lunch to celebrate her birthday. We were pleasantly surprised when we were ushered to a private room when I didn't book one. The room had tatami seating, perfect for us! We ordered a bento set each costing just below $50 and a plate of 4 slices of kampachi truffle sashimi for $40. Costly but it's worth the price tag. The aroma of truffle exploded in my mouth once I started chewing the raw fish. Lovely! The bento sets were too big for us, we ended up eating only the raw fish from the sushi and leaving the rice behind.
This restaurant is at level 1 of Goodwood Park hotel on the left side from the main entrance. Nearest train station is Orchard plus a 10 minute walk along Scotts Road."
One of the go-to places for good Japanese food,"I was there for a business lunch and had the opportunity to be seated in one of the private dining rooms. The service was impeccable, and should be expected of for a restaurant of this quality.

The food was delectable as well. It was omakase for us and the chef prepared a good variety of dishes. A few of the memorable ones were the skipjack tuna sashimi paired with caviar and umi, the wagyu beef, and also the aburi sushi.

Tatsuya is a Japanese fine dining restaurant so if you are heading there to eat your hearts out, then be prepared to spend or get disappointed. Otherwise, the quality of food should be lauded and I for one would definitely return."
So good!,"Go for dinner. You won't regret it. In Singapore, if you want good Japanese food, be prepared to spend. The ambience is OK too but when the next guest is chewing with his mouth wide open..."
Outstanding quality and value,"I've been wracking my brains (what's left of them) to try to remember if I've eaten better sushi. I think the answer is no. Quite simply the set lunch bento boxes at S$45++ are a steal. My lunch companion then went and blew S$30 on two pieces of scallop and foie gras sushi - tbh it was wasted on me, the foie gras completely overwhelmed the scallop. I'm clearly a man of simple tastes. You need to book but there's nothing about Tatsuya I could find to criticise. It's a joy..."
Outraging pricing practice !!!,"We went to Tatsuya following reviews read on internet. we went there the first time and were satisfied with the Bentos (sushi, sashimi or eel). we also took a plate of wagyu to share. it was a first good impression. as long as we stayed with the Bento and not the ""full course"" which cost 4 to 5 times the price for not really much more. they serve you the dishes one by one instead of all at once.
However the second time was a complete disappointment. it started with the advanced booking. i asked for a table of 5 in the restaurant, instead of eating at the sushi bar (how can you talk ?), especially when the sushi bar is in a corridor...and the waitress on the phone said ""ok but minimum charge 100$ per person. i had to remind that i came once before and there was no such minimum charge. she said ""ok"". so we went and we ordered the same bento / person and the same wagyu to share. but this time upon paying...it costs us 30$ per piece of wagyu when we had it the first time for 30-40$ the whole plate of 6 pieces of wagyu. one piece of wagyu was almost the price of one Bento (40$).
i would call that cheating on the customer. there is a problem with the management. it is not paying respect to the hard work from the cook who will not understand why there will be less and less customers returning to them.
we will never go back to this restaurant and i can only advise everybody to pay attention to the price."
High quality sushi!,"The food is very fresh. The service is friendly while premium, price at the high end. A classic: seating inside gives you the great pleasure to watch the chefs preparing the dishes. Overall great experience!"
Innovative Japanese cuisine,"Having just returned to SIngapore from living in Tokyo for 3 years I can speak with some authority on how good and representative of good Japanese sushi.
Restaurant is modern and larger than typical sushi restaurants in Japan however, the design of the interior has a very Japanese feel.
Owner is not Japanese but highly respected chef with deep knowledge of Japanese food and the some of the sushi chefs are Japanese.
Ingredients largely Japan sourced and pretty good quality however, can you expect same as in Tokyo which is closer to the source ..no.
Preparation is innovative and not always traditional in approach with a more fusion feel to the dishes. That said the sushi is very good and tasty.
Recommend sitting at the counter and booking in advance as restaurant is popular including with Japanese."
Wedding anniversary omakase lunch,"We went to Tatsuya for lunch to celebrate our wedding anniversary last week. Brought our children along as well. We sat at the counter so we could watch the chefs in action. The quality of the food is excellent, we enjoyed the assorted Aburi style sushi, ikura marinated in a yuzu soy dressing as well as the wagyu beef. My children had a smaller version of what we had and the chef prepared a small bowl of saga beef don which they thoroughly enjoyed. Service by the hostess and the staff was excellent, kids were offered yummy peach ice cream for dessert while we had the rock melon."
very good lunch,"loved the atmosphere and lunch here, customer service was great too, food was delicious, nice set lunches they do and a great place to do business"
Sushi for aficionados,"The best in Singapore, so far if you prefer Japan-style sashimi and nigiri.

We tried both the raw and aburi styles. The rice was cooked perfectly and the seafood was of the utmost freshness. They do have some varieties that are off menu so ask for the specials.

PS: if you're used to California-style sushi (saucy rolls), they have great ones here, too."
Best sushi,I had an weekday unplanned lunch ar Tatsuya and I had the best sushi ever tasted outside of Japan. Fish is super fresh and presentation carefully arranged by the friendly staff.
Warm and accomadating,"Wonderful birthday celebration for my sister, they brought out a surprise cheesecake at the end of our meal. The restaurant is usually crowded so be sure to book in advance! We were grateful and lucky they had a private room for us that night. The seats at the counter can be noisy. The food was really great even though it can be pricey. The beef don is not on the regular menu but it's so worth ordering. Tender and soft beef, replicating a mushroom texture. Would go again for special ocassions!"
Amazing,"This is a beautiful little sushi bar. Amazing food served by an enthusiastic Japanese chef, chef Sasaki.

Food were beautifully crafted, it was great fun to watch the chef gobble over his ingredients excitedly to put the courses together with incredible attention to detail.

ask for omakase from chef sasaki, always"
Go for the sushi. Skip the Omakase,"I haven’t been to Tatsuya since they moved to Goodwood. In the “old days”, the top sushi restaurants were Nogawa and Tatsuya but have since been overshadowed by many new ones. My first impression was the narrow space and a long sushi counter with a noisy ambience. We had the $300 omakase and was disappointed. The sashimi and sushi quality was good but the other dishes didn’t wow us. Compared with other omakase in Japanese chef run restaurants the presentation and creativity were lacking. We didn’t think it was value for money. The other negative was that the local senior chef behind the counter, who virtually ignored us while he was friendly enough with the regular customers seated next to us. Not quite courtesy standard expected in place like this. He was also the loudest voice in the whole restaurant and quite unnecessarily so, even though we understand sushi restaurant chefs do make noises to create ambience. Somewhat lacking in finesse in my opinion. Wouldn’t go back other than perhaps for sushi lunch. Also, it’s not the same without Ronnie."
Still one of the Best!,"Tatsuya is a small quaint Japanese restaurant nestled in Goodwood Park Hotel. It’s a little disconnected from the hotel lobby and not to be confused with the other Teppanyaki establishment on the same property. One must try their set lunches and lunch menu which I find to be excellent and decent value for money. Yes it is alittle on the pricier side but the quality is excellent. I always go for the Unagi Sashimi set which comes with tempura, chawanmushi and miso soup. Top it off with a nice serving of Uni. Fresh and delicious. The omakase is too pricey for me, there are other establishments with better value I feel. However service and sitting at the chef’s counter is a great experience always!"
Perfect!,"Still probably one of the best sushi place in Singapore, it is very pricy, same as in a good sushi bar in Tokyo but the quality of the ingredients are top, super fresh, the service is also perfect. All the sushi chefs are Japanese this is a good. Super clean and trendy place."
Pricey but always satisfying meals,"Tatsuya is expensive, so I don't go there very regularly, but when I have something to celebrate, this is my number one choice and they never fail to delight. Their ingredients are top grade and the recommended dishes are always worth trying. Don't sit in the small room inside though. Sit in front of the chefs and let them surprise you. There's not much to look at in the menu, but look at the chefs and just point at anything that sparks, you won't be disappointed."
"Not cheap, but the meal is always worth the trip","Lunch bentos keep their quality. It's always a delight to get counter seats, with a view of the fresh seafood being prepared for diners by pleasant itamae-san.
Highly recommendable. Will return again and again.
Tip: A cheaper alternative to parking at Goodwood Park Hotel is Far East Plaza parking."
Disappointed lunch,"Heard of Tatsuya from friend, so we went there for lunch. The set lunch menu was disappointing. Is not about the pricing. First of all, if the set menu is $100 plus, I will expect a decent and nice menu. Not a digital homemade menu with lamination. Food photos that look washout.
Basis presentable menu is a must. The lunch is so so, no wow factor. I dare to say with a $100 budget, I can have better fine dining lunch."
Good value lunch sets,"Very fresh ingredients are used for their good value lunch sets, making them so enjoyable if one does not mind the wait and sitting by the bar counter due to the limited seating, and considering how packed the place can be during meal hours."
Best (Authentic) Japanese Food I’ve tried,"The food in this restaurant was fantastic. We asked them to make us a selection of courses and devoured the whole thing. Extremely authentic Japanese food, great service and the ambiance was very real as well. Quite pricey but worth it if you’re a foodie!"
With an award winning chef don’t ever doubt the class,Sushi will never taste the same again after you have been here. My very first experience of freshly grated wasabi. Nothing on the menu was less than 5* Honestly the best. And impeccable service by the kimono wearing staff. And you pay for it too
Too overpriced and shocking!,"Last evening, 4 of us with a room to ourselves and we expected to have an excellent meal. With 3 glasses of beer and the bill turned up to $2100/- that is more than $500/- per pax. The quality of food was so so, the dishes were nothing outstanding. It’s a daylight robbery, and I would ask all to be very watchful. Not recommended at all."
The best Omakase in Singapire,"Nested in the ground floor of the Goodwood Hotel in Scott Rd. Tatsuya is differing from the famous Tetsuya in Sydney ( and now in Singapore too) for only one letter.
And at to my modest opinion is serving an even better japanese cuisine. Nigiri, Sashimi, Maki, Usuzukuri using stellar ingredients and prepared either in a very traditional way or, at your leisure, in a contemporary arrangement.
A magistral use of the ""Aburi Technique"" is adding something special to the best Omakase you can have in Singapore. The price is staying on the high end of the rank but quality, attention and skill of the Sushi Men brigade is largely compensating the money issue."
Super Japanese,From the sushi to the wagyu beef.... flawless It’s a small restaurant and it’s actually more fun to sit by the sushi counter and see the chefs cook live. It’s definitely not a cheap place to dine but then it’s Singapore!!!!
Very good sushi restaurant,"Visited this restaurant a few days ago. It is very well located at the ground floor of the impressive Goodwood Park Hotel in central Singapore (22 Scotts Road). The setting is very nice with an elongated sushi bar, as well as an area with tables. Everything that was served was very fresh, tasty and elegantly presented. Both sushi and grilled fish (mackerel) were of high quality and the service very good. An excellent place to dine!"
Divine Dining,By far the best Japanese food ever!! Quality of food and service was extraordinary. Thank you to all the Chefs who took care of us and Shirley who knew what we exactly wanted on the menu.
Good but expensive,"Don't step into this restaurant if you are not prepared to spend a lot of money for food. The lowest price set lunch was $32++ and and the higher price ones can run into a few hundreds dollars. The restaurant is not very big. A long sushi bar counter plus a small room with only 3 tables. Alfresco dinning is available but not conducive for the hot Singapore weather.

Service was excellent. I ordered the sushi set which costs $100 ++. An appetiser and a small dessert were included. What can I say about the sushi - it was so good. Literally melt in the mouth. I wish I can go there more often but the price is a big deterrent."
Good but very expensive,"For sure this restaurant is classy, the sushi are very good , nothing you will kill for but good, service is absolutely perfect , most of the sushi chef are Japanese this is good! Prices are super high , I suppose you pay for the perfect service, perfect sushi bar (hyper clean) and for the location"
Fine Japanese food but expensive,"We regularly visit this Japanese restaurant at least 6 times a year for more than 10 years. It's consistently good in terms of the quality of the food and never once has the food disappoint; however, the service staff can be a hit or miss at times.

If budgets a constraint; then it's best to avoid, as it's not cheap. You will get better value in Japan or Taiwan.

This weekend there was a promotional set. I had the $150++ set lunch; & have posted the yummy main dish.

Singapore"
The best Japanese food in Singapore,"This is simply the best Japanese food in Singapore served fresh. Although it is a little pricy, it is worth every cent. Sit at the bar and let the chefs serve you with the freshest seafood and mouthwatering treats you have never experienced before. They place great attention to detail and are always experimenting to Come up with New tastes and textures.. ask for Goh San or Sasaki San."
Into Sashimi? Sushi?,"This is the place to go - a reasonably new Japanese restaurant which is located along the right hand wall to the entrance of the Goodwood Park Hotel's main entrance (if it is raining - ask the
Taxi Driver to drop you off at the door). Mr. Sasaki Kazuyuki is the Senior Sushi Chef and it is amazing the variety that is made right in front of you if you are seated at the Sushi Bar - for the less venturous there are also wonderful bento boxes to be had -
open 12.00 for lunch not sure of time for dinner - would suggest a booking"
Glad I didn't pay!,I lived in Japan for many years and love Japanese food. The food here was ok but extremely pricey. The service was a real let down. No Japanese waiter/waitress in sight and it showed. Certainly not what you would expect from a Japanese restaurant at a 5 star hotel.
Aburi Chirashi Don (LARGE),"I come here when I have a craving for a luxe aburi chirashi don. It's expensive but it's so flavorful!

Other special dishes (of the same flavorful vein as the aburi chirashi don) are: seared prawn sushi wrapped in tiny omelette w special sauce n caviar, wagyu don (omi), scallop w foie gras sushi, special maki ($60), hokkaido ice cream brulee

All very pricey but totally worth it for their umami bomb and great taste.

I've only ever been here for lunch and always sit at the counter. It's very noisy as I believe they do alot of takeout orders. So it's kinda against the whole luxe concept. But no matter. I'm just here for the food!"
Read the good reviews with a pinch of salt,"My husband saw many good reviews for Tatsuya , but I wasn't impressed with some irregular shaped sushi roll pics posted by some diners . Anyhow , we need to find out just how good is good and which league is Tatsuya in so we decided to try it out for lunch .

Was seated at the bar counter . Wanted to order the omakase but decided to save it for dinner if the lunch proves to be good . They have cheaper lunch sets from $30-50 but we ordered the aburi lunch sets at $90per set. ( although I am not a fan of aburi when it come to sushi but apparently TAtsuya is famous for this)

Observations while at bar counter :
1) selection of fresh seafood is limited , mostly are the common and inexpensive stuff like salmon / sword fish , hamachi , surf clam and a piece of toro.

2) parts of the bar counter is made of laminate and not the solid beech wood which is deemed one of the key and sacred elements for a reputable sushi restaurant . Some of the counter areas has some black patches that looked like moulds. It is sad as this counter is highly associated with a sushi chef's pride and honour.

3) the sushi chef frequently place plates and cans /bottles items on his chopping board while using the same board to cut their sashimi for guests ! Unbelievably for a sushi restaurant that charges up to $350 for its omakase. I would forgive this act if it is a restaurant that charges $20 for a meal. Really shocked ..

4) You can tell if a chef is professional by the knives he used and how he takes care of his knife . For a sushi chef, this is his sacred tool. Chef here tossed his knives haphazardly in a corner after using them to cut the sashimi , dumps them in the sink and scrubs it vigorously with a scotch pad like some cheap knives .. not trying to be a snob , this is just not pro ...

5) We ordered our lunch around 2pm, and half way thru the meal at 230 pm, the sushi counter was cleared and turn into a washing area .. everyone was frantically cleaning and scrubbing the entire length of bar counter ... soap /foam / Pails/ bleach are all at display on the counter . They seemed oblivious that there are still guests at the sushi counter trying to have their lunch peacefully . We are forced to watch the entire cleaning exercise while having our lunches .. Nobody really bothers .. they just talked loudly amongst themselves , discussing the cleaning process and what to clean next . Bleached was poured into a big pail filling with water from the tap right in front of us while we tried to swallow our aburi amidst the strong smell of bleach and occasional splashing of water over the counter that closely missed our aburi.

5) The Aburi - each piece of sushi ( was was intensively torched with two canister ejecting flames simultaneously ... the result ... fish cooked almost to the core ... not exactly the skilled way to create the slightly oily but soft and tender aburi sushi .. Side dishes - nothing worth mentioning .

Verdict
This sushi restaurant does not have much passion/respect with regards to its ingredients , its. sushi counter , it's knives and it's guests. Food hygiene is even in doubt .

Thus , our conclusion is that Tatsuya is miles away from being the best sushi restaurant in Singapore ... please read all the good reviews with a pinch of salt ..

It is nowhere near the top end sushi league of Shinji , hashida and kimura sushi .

it is probably just slightly better than those neighborhood or chain restaurants .

Don't waste your money on its omakase , go somewhere for some authentic and genuine sushi experience for this price. This place has no passion in every aspects.

We won't be back for sure ."
Good fresh sashimi,It's my first visit here with great expectations and the food did not disappoint. Over here it's quality over quantity in choices. Be prepared to spend an average of $140 per pax. Total damages were $420+ after 10% credit card disc.
i have been coming back to this restaurant for many years and i never get disappointed.,"not a cheap meal but totally worth every penny. The location is lovely, the staff is super friendly and helpful and the food is really realy yummy."
Best Sushi in Singapore!,"We had a fantastic night recently at Tatsuya and will definitely be going back. Seats at the Sushi counter, while a little awkward for a couple, were great as we got to see all our food being prepared."
"Personally I loved it, but would I recommend it?","I am not so sure. I ate here almost daily during my visit to Singapore, and I liked and loved so many things about it. The reason I hesitate to recommend it, is certainly because it is expensive, and I didn't have dinner in a Japanese restaurant of similar category to compare it with in Singapore. I also ate very simply, I did not have the set menus, so my food was not indicative of what others were eating. You certainly do not have to spend what some other reviewers had mentioned, our dinners on average were around $100 per person with one drink. However, venture into set menus and drinks, and you may feast and pay for it as well. So I would qualify my recommendation of this restaurant, absolutely go if you are not concerned about prices, or if you want to order from their a la carte menu and don't get carried away with off the menu items. The chefs are fantastic, the food is great, the service is excellent. Do I remember the prices or do I remember the food? actually I remember the food."
Over Rated,Disappointed with the capital D. The foods was ok but not at the price they charged. Service was below par. Had to wait for a while to the soup to be served.
Very good (but expensive) Japanese food,"My hubby and I initially booked Hide Yamamoto at MBS for the evening but we felt that it was too long a drive and it may also be a chore to find parking on a Saturday night. Hence, we decided to ring Tatsuya to see if they would be able to accommodate us. Surprise, surprise they had two counter seats available. This was unusual as we literally rang up at noon for dinner at 7:30pm. This would be our third time here.

Raw food is not really my cup of tea and a o my husband went for the sushi portion for one which was $120. It came with 9 pieces of sushi (3 aburi and 6 raw) along with a miso soup and appetizer. I ordered half of the special makimoto and the cold noodles with tempura. We then ordered another half makimoto along with 2 wagyu beef aburi. We also had a cold 250ml sake to wash down the dinner along with green tea and Sapporo beer. For dessert, we had the Hokkaido caramel ice cream.

Overall, the dinner was very pleasant and the food was undeniably good. Some years ago, we came by and had the full Monty of chef's omakase but that was way too much food.

The bill was under $400 and we only realised later that we were accorded with a 10% discount on the bill - my husband didn't manage to ask as he did not notice it when paying the bill. It could be a credit card promotion but we are still not sure.

I will definitely come back as the food is good but for the pricing, it would have to be for a treat or a very special occasion :-)"
Genuine and superb Japanese,"Having previously lived in Japan for an extended period I have very high standards and a refined palate for sushi and Japanese cuisine generally. It takes a lot to impress me however Tatsuya did it. Delightfully subtly yet professional service ensures that the food is what dominates the experience. While omakase (chef's selection/degustation) is not my preferred meal style this is the place to do it, however the elegance of their sushi selection (and agedashi tofu of course) is very hard to beat. The wine list is very good but the sake selection is divine. I think it could be the best Japanese I've had outside of Japan. The only warning is that you need to have a real passion for Japanese cuisine and genuinely value extraordinarily produce to cope with the bill. It can be an expensive evening."
Discriminated,"We went to Tatsuya after reading the good reviews. I will agree with most of reviewers. Food was good but service was rushed. But we also felt discriminated. My Husband and I were seated at the bar thinking it's more fun to watch the chefs at work . But it was not fun at all!

The Chef was giving special treatment to the couple next to us. Maybe they were regulars or they give fat tips and deserved special treatment. This was fine but the Chef completely ignored us the whole time. It's quite awkward as the Chef was only talking and focusing on the couple. Serving them special dishes one after another. I have no issues that regulars get special treatment. But to be totally ignored when we were seated just next to the couple at the bar the entire evening was bad form and insensitive."
Good but really not worth the price nor effort,"It is quite good for a Japanese restaurant in Singapore. But is Tetsuya worth the price? Absolutely ... Not.

For what it's worth, the quality of the food is what you will get a modest neighborhood restaurant in most of Japan. For the price you are paying at Tetsuya you should get at least a one star value, but as I mentioned, it is both far from satisfactory in terms of taste.

You'd better off heading to Suntec City and having your Japanese fix there for 1/4 the price.

I would not recommend this place."
No passion in the Cooking and Very Very Bad Service. Will Not Be Back Again!,"Feb 2017. Had Dinner. Ordered Omakase. Total Bill S$1,300+ for 3 pax.

We have in the past dined at this restaurant several times but sadly this will be our very last visit.

Most of the staff from the chef to the waitresses, gave us the impression that they want to finish serving our dinner as fast as possible.

We initially thought there were 3 seatings that night because they were rushing us through our dinner. But at about 9:30pm when we finished, we noticed that there was not a single soul queuing outside the restaurant.

They were rushing to finish serving all the dishes as soon as they could. I saw there were salad even sashimi prepared way before they were being taken away to be served.

The whole experience was as if we were part of a very efficient production line. The chef prepared the food very quickly, the waitress served them at lighting speed and we have to swallow the food very fast. There were a few instances as we were finishing our food the waitress was already standing next to us waiting to serve us the next course. It was as if she was trying to tell us ""hurry up, why haven't you finished?"" thus pressuring us to quickly gobble down our food. The only dish we have to wait was our beef.

The whole night we felt that the staff was trying to finished their work as fast as they could maybe so that they can go home early. We felt so rushed and we were not comfortable at all.

This place is a total ripped off now. We felt there isn't any passion at all in their cooking. Every course tasted very mediocre. Even cheap and simple Itacho provides much better service and cooks better food then them. Not sure what Tatsuya uses in their cooking because we felt very thirsty and needed to drink lots of water after this dinner.

Well, I have totally regretted my decision to dine here instead of elsewhere as suggested by other members of the family. Never again will we be back.

To be honest the best food of the night was the birthday cake which was ordered from the deli at Goodwood Park Hotel."
A Great Place to eat authentic Japanese food,"If you like your Japanese food delicious, authentic and fresh, this is the place to go. I had the sashimi bento and simply adored it. The wasabi was very delicious. The sashimi is simply stunning to eat. The tamago was sweet and supple. Everything is just nice at an affordable price of just $45++ per set. A high recommendation."
Wonderful sushi bar and chefs,We enjoyed an Omakase menu by one of the expert sushi chefs. He let us choose our favorites and tailored the experience. We'll be back again!
Fresh Sushi,Delicious & fresh sushi. I like to sit at the sushi bar. I especially like their tuna roll and Japanese pickles. They also offer take away which is a plus.
A Taste of Japan in Singapore,"My wife and I visited Tatsuya Japanese Restaurant at Goodwood Park Hotel yesterday for lunch to celebrate my birthday. It was our 2nd time there in a month. Advanced booking is recommended. You can choose to sit at the sushi bar or at a private table in a cozy dining area. We arrived around 1pm and noticed that the sushi bar counter was fully occupied.

In this restaurant, you are guaranteed authentic Japanese food. All ingredients are freshly imported fromTsukiji wholesale market. The service is prompt and swiftly executed. I was impressed that the lady serving us remembered us and even what we ordered previously.

If you are planning to eat here, be prepared to splash. The food is not cheap. But the food is fresh, tasty and prepared with a lot of passion. You are not paying for the food, you are paying for the whole experience.

For starters, we ordered their avocado salad (served with a dressing made from rice wine and sesame oil and other ingredients), and nimono (a rich vegetable stew with shredded chicken). Our main meal was the shashimi unajyu (eel) set. The cawanmushi that came with the set was smooth and the best I ever tasted. We also tried the aradaki daikon dish (consisting the head of the amberjack fish with Japanese radish and soup stock). The fish was fresh and fleshy and went superbly well with the radish.

All, in all it was an excellent experience. If there was one improvement that I could suggest is that the menu should also provide the names and include the description of the various dishes in English. It would then save everyone some time asking the staff to explain them to us.

A great restaurant, great ambience, great experience."
Not traditional but excellent,"Over the past years, my palate for Japanese food has always been bias towards Tatsuya.

They may not serve the traditional omakase, they do however serve very fresh and well made dishes in the course.

Notably their aburi sushi are almost always constantly Good, but do take note that they use vinegar in most of their sushi and hence the taste is more flavourful thus by which i mean non traditional. For those who wants to taste the natural freshness of the food then just inform the chef. They are always friendly and I always felt like I'm home during my visits there.

Their weekday lunch are also quite reasonably priced and a good power lunch there with bento sets are always good value for money for excellent Japanese food.

Chef Goh San always remembers what I prefer and notices what I don't like so he will prepare something else for me. A truly personal experience while it can be pricey this is a fine dinning Japanese restaurant which I feel is worth every cent."
"Very good aburi sushi, but not the best I had","Always wanted to try Tatsuya after watching it shown on AFC Best thing I ever ate. Went there for lunch, and tried the Aburi sushi set. Ingredients used were very fresh. Really good quality caviar was served. However, I did not get any interactions from the sushi chef (I was seated at the counter). Service was above average but not the best.

Overall, very good quality sushi, although not the best I had."
Amazing dinner,"Wow - what a dinner !

Such a amazing Japanese dinner - great night , fantastic atmosphere - sooooo good.

The chefs went from very good to better to amazing .
I will for sure come back - and anyone who looks for the best of Sushi - don't look further - this is the place in Singapore"
J,Pricey but worth it. Spent $600 on dinner for a couple. The sushi and sashimi was fresh as it comes. Prepared amazingly well! Art work on a plate with friendly service. Definitely a one of a kind Japanese restaurant!!
Best Aburi Chirashi in town!,This restaurant serves the finest quality of Japanese food with the ingredients imported from Tsukiji Market in Japan. Ask for the Aburi Chirashi when you dine here! It is pricey but worth indulging on! Love it so much!
A must place for sushi lovers,So my husband and I wanted a nice chilled out evening and we decided to go to Tatsuya for some exotic sushis... The head sushi chef was serving us that night.... What a place... Totally awesome... 😊👌
Just not as satisfied at the end of dinner,"The quality of food is not bad but I did not quite like the ambience. Firstly, I can't stand the loud unsoothing music being played throughout dinner. Secondly there is now where to place my handbag other than their cupboard. Even though it's a night out with my husband, I need to be contactable just in case the children need me...I had my phone on the table the whole time round. Looking around I realized everyone has their phone on the table next to them. Thirdly, I've tried so many Omakase restaurants, Tatsuya made me feel ""cheated"". I saw the photos posted in trip advisor and realized I was served similar kind of sushi, sashimi to customers months back... I mean I thought Omakase means serving the freshest seasonal catch imported from Japan. And the Uni served was the size of my pinky fingernail on top of a piece of sushi! I spent $1600 and I think I'm better off at sushi ichi!! Too bad they were fully booked for the night! Lastly, the place was noisy, uncomfortable and overcrowded. Felt a little like communal dinning... All the chefs looked like they are in an assembly line..."
Outstanding sushi,"Great atmosphere. Outstanding food. The preparation and the presentation were top notch. Very expensive, but worth it."
Best Aburi Sushi,"Fine dining. Nice good. Please try Aburi Sushi or Aburi sashimi Tuna belly Soup. That visit was the 5th time . Now whenever we visit Singapore, We will have at least kne dinner in that Japanese restaurant . Recommended."
One of the best for an authentic Japanese foodexperience in Town,"Read quite lots of great reviews before coming here and truly the reviews are proven to be true, in terms of the fresh ingredients and the great flavor of dishes served by the chefs.

Went here for lunch as they have set lunch menus which is quite bargain for the wallet. Yet we also ordered many other items from the a la carte such as sashimi (ootoro), rolls, oyster and sushi. All the ingredients are so fresh you can immediately tell.

Best seats would be at the bar, cause you then will be able to see the chefs in action, preparing the orders with great skill, which is a good attraction itself. Weekend is usually a busy period, so prior reservation is a must otherwise even waiting is not
possible since the capacity isn't much."
Go for the omakase,"One of the best omakase experiences in Singapore, and each chef brings a different flair and style to their dishes. It is quite pricey (approx. SGD 500/person), but worth every penny. Dietary restrictions are always taken into consideration and their service is top notch. Lunch deals are extremely value-for-money."
Amazing omakase,"We visited tatsuya based on the recommendation of a friend and loved it. The sushi chef was amazingly talented and the fish was very fresh. We got the lunch omakase which was 200 singapore dollars per peson but it was definitely worth it. If you love sushi and have the money to spend, dont miss this place."
Amazing Food!,"The food was fresh, delicious and extremely good. I loved the place! The service was incredibly hospitable and as vegetarians, we found the guided us well. The food! By far the best Japanese food in Singapore. It was fresh, of amazing quality and really well served. The atmosphere and layout of the restaurant is also great. If your visiting or looking for a nice place to eat with the family, Tatsuya is the place!!"
Ordinary,"Frankly a very ordinary experience for the price we paid. In their moderate defence, I'm comparing to restaurants in Tokyo and London. This was not a patch on them. The wagyu was extremely poor while some of the sushi and sashimi were nice. I would not go here in Singapore where there are an array of amazing restaurants"
Amazing sushi!,"This is by far the best sushi experience I have had in my life. The fish was so fresh, service was amazing, and you get to see the sushi masters in action right in front of your eyes. Highly recommended if you like traditional Japanese cuisine. No brainer."
Creative sushi,"My wife surprised me with dinner at Tatsuya ! She had had lunch here before and wanted to bring me for dinner.
We sat at a table but realised that it's more fun to sit at the counter and watch the food preparation . Staff are friendly and our host explained the menu and specials. We told her we wanted to try a selection of sushi and sashimi and left her to request the Chef to prepare the items.
The sashimi was very fresh - fish is flown is from Tsujiki market - and it's better without soya sauce. Our sushi was done aburi style , and had very interesting toppings - like caviar , truffle sauce , radish etc..
We also tried the wagyu beef slices which proved to be tender and very tasty.
For dessert the Hokkaido caramel ice cream is a must - actually one serving may not be enough !
Overall a lovely fine dining Japanese experience which would have been nicer if we sat at the counter. I have to thank my wife for bringing me here.
Good place for special dinner occasions given the expensive pricing . Lunch has less expensive options but food just as good and fresh ."
Best sushi in town!,"Had a fantastic meal at Tatsuya! By far the best sushi in Singapore. The flavours are delicate and the food is prepared with a lot of love and presented beautifully. It was a lovely experience. Real perfection :)

The ginger tofu was divine and they prepared a special avocado, asparagus green salad for us with a sesame dressing which was also really nice. The sushi was out of the world and the tempura was light and satiating.

Highly recommend Tatsuya!"
Best sashimi & sushi in town!,"I'm usually quite apprehensive where raw seafood is concerned but was reassured by the very first morsel presented. So fresh you could smell the ocean! We let the chef decide the courses. From various servings of sashimi, sushi, soup and rolls, all extremely well prepared and tasty.
Only complaint was the seats at the counter were blasted with cold air and we had to ask the wait staff to turn down the air conditioner.
I can get a bit noisy with the chefs, wait staff and customers all chatting away at the same time. Another minus was the 1 unisex toilet which was outside the restaurant which meant a long wait made uncomfortable if you had to go urgently!!
Overall the experience was very positive, the food divine, with a price to match!!!"
Good value set lunch,"Tatsuya is an expensive, high-end Japanese restaurant in the Goodwood Park Hotel near Orchard MRT. Set price dinners approach $300 per person, however at lunchtime you can pick up a sushi / sashimi bento or a chirashi set for around $45. The quality of the fish is outstanding and the restaurant is nice. Service is friendly but on both occasions I have visited they were very busy. Book ahead."
