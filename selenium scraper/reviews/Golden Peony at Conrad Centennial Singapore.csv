Golden Peony @ Conrad,"Impressed with quality of food and awesome service by the team especially Ms Vanessa Chong who not only attentive and also very professional, made many good recommendation and she goes through extra mile to meet our special requests!!"
golden peony,"jean chong was very attentive, excellent service from all staffs..nice food and calamisi drink goes well with avocado dessert."
golden peony,shirlene is very helpful and good service food is good birthday surprise definitely will come again.
Poor standard,"Had selected Amethyst set dinner at Golden Peony. Was very disappointed at the low standard. My wife had just started on the soup but the 3rd course of fish was already left at side table. This was removed to kitchen after a few minutes. Then while my wife was just starting on the prime rib, the Mian Sian (noodle soup,) was left at the side of the table. I asked the staff why the Mian sian was served when we had not finish the rib. The noodle soup would be cold by the time we finish the rib. Staff went to feedback to supervisor and the noodle was brought back to kitchen. We felt so pressured to finish our food. It was only about 8pm ! After my wife finished the rib, we had to wait 10 minutes but the noodles were not served. We had to ask the staff to serve the noodles. There was a column asking type of occasion when we made the reservation and we input it was our anniversary but not even a slice of cake to wish us a happy anniversary. Other restaurants provided a slice of cake wishing us happy anniversary. But seems Conrad didn't bother about such extra gesture to delight guests. Sad to see how low the standard is at Conrad nowadays."
Good Saturday lunch,"We had lunch at Golden Peony on a Saturday. We ordered jasmine tea, pork belly, vinegar pork knuckle, prawn dumplings, mushroom rolls, and sesame pancakes. We received a discount because we were staying at the Conrad. We were given several menus including a weekday dim sum menu. We wanted to order some of the items, but nothing on the menu was available on Saturday (we're sorry now that we saw the weekday menu)."
Home coming üëçüèªüëçüèª,Another enjoyable dinner at this restaurant. Manager Shirlene made us feel ‚Äúat home‚Äù when we dine in. Dishes recommended by her were delicious and her service has always been outstanding. Will always dine here any time. üëçüèªüëçüèª thank you Shirlene & her team.
Excellent Cantonese food,"Excellent Cantonese cuisine well prepared and presented. Been eating here with my family for 20 years and the dishes have been consistently good. The Peking duck is well made and the clear soups are very good. The avocado and ice cream is the best I have tasted. The Rediscovery Menu is excellent value for money. The staff are friendly and it feels like dining at home . Special thanks to Jane , Esther and Vanessa for always taking good care of us ."
Special occasion,"Brought my parents to Golden Peony for their wedding anniversary dinner and tried the rediscovery menu which I noticed some reviewers also had. Personal favourites will be the crispy noodles with lobster and the top up for beef short ribs. They also kindly arrange a platter of sweet potato filo pastry. Appreciate the service of Vanessa, Jean and Kai Wei."
My favorite place for set dinner,"My 9th visit, still picked the rediscovery set menu.
The duo magnificent was just okay but
The kami sakura chicken prawn soup,
The jade perch with preserved vegetable,
The crispy egg noodle half lobster and
The double -boiled almond cream were all good.
Added SGD10 for the lion prime rib and it was good, really worth it, great value for money.
Again, almost a perfect dinner.

Excellent service from Miss Vanessa and her team members. Truly a great place for dining."
Parents Wedding Anniversary & Dad‚Äôs Birthday,"A nice rediscovery 6-course set dinner. Decent taste and quality.
Service could have been better e.g tea flavor not out yet being poured, wrong orders, serving staff pour hot tea while I‚Äôm taking photo which could have almost scalded me. Maybe expect more for such setting of restaurant. Nevertheless give credit for preparing my dad a ÂØøÊ°Ébun for his birthday"
Authentic Tasty Cantonese Food,"Attentive service especially by service staff Kai Wei. Very authentic food, good portion. Can use Hilton Honors for discount."
Well curated Chinese set dinner with good service,We had dinner for 6 at Golden Peony. It has been a long lapse since I went to this restaurant 20years ago. The food was great and great service too.
GP lunch,"We have a fabulous time at Golden Peony food was good service was excellent! Thanks to Kai Wei, Vanessa and Shirlene!"
Service that I cannot forget,"I brought my family to dine in golden peony today. The service and the food recommendation was really good and just nice for us.

I would definitely recommend my friends and family to Conrad Golden Peony again. Staff that assist us was Shirlene the manager who was really helpful and kind. Jean Chong, Vanessa Wong and Xian ping. Thank you for the great service"
Fabulous dining,Had a fabulous dinner with family in Golden peony. The dinner was good n the service is excellent. The ambiance is nice n cosy. The outlet manager Ms Shirlene Chan helps us with food selection and wine recommendations.
A must go-to Chinese restaurant in my book,"This is one of the best Chinese restaurants I go to. The food is great and the service is impeccable. Special mention of Shirlene, the restaurant manger, who never fails to show us what great service is. Each dining experience is always a pleasure where we feel absolutely comfortable and special. Kudos to Shirlene and team to make this all happen so well, to the extent that we miss the food and the service!
A must try in my book."
My favorite place for set dinner,"My 8th visit, still picked the rediscovery set menu. The rock prawns were above average. The kami sakura chicken,prawn soup was good.
The jade perch with preserved vegetable was also good, especially good if eaten with plain white rice. I guess this is the weakest part of this set menu, but this time the chef got it right.
The wagyu short rib, the crispy egg noodle half lobster and the double-boiled almond cream were all good. Again almost a perfect dinner.

Left the place full and completely satisfied, that kind of shiok shiok feeling stayed with me for the next few days, really worth it.
Excellent service from Miss Esther and her teammates.

This is my new account, same name and picture as the previous one. My first visit here was in July 2021, during the previous 7 visits, I ordered the discovery/rediscovery set menu 5 times and the amethyst set menu twice. Pretty glad to have found this great dining place."
Birthday Celebration,Service was excellent and thoughtful. Unexpected complimentary cake for the occasion which surprised us. Thank you!
Amazing service and food,Thank you to Manager Shirlene for helping to arrange the food. She was very accommodating and the food was amazing! And my business lunch went well
Birthday celebration at golden peony,"Thank you for Vanessa, Esther for always checkin in on us, warmed welcome and great service.
Good memorize and remember all our favourites."
Lunch at Golden Peony,"Friendly staff and good service, especially thanks to Esther and Vanessa for the great & warm service.
Nice environment and delicious food.
Will definitely come again."
Wonderful Service,I was worried about my client's dietary and thanks the manager Stanley who helped me to adjust the menu and took care of us.
My favourite place for set dinner,"My 7th visit, still picked the rediscovery menu. The duo magnificent was good. The kami sakura chicken soup was good, the prawn inside was pretty fresh. The jade perch served with preserved vegetable was above average. The half lobster crispy egg noodle was just okay. Added SGD10 for the wagyu short rib and it was very good, really worth it. This was the best dish for the evening. The dessert tang yuan was a bit too sweet for me.

Again excellent service from Miss Esther.

First visited this place last July, just completed one full cycle here, glad to have found this place."
Don‚Äôt think there will be a second time,"Went there to celebrate birthday, also my first Cantonese experience in Singapore.

I was cordially received by Vanessa and Jane via mail when I prearranged my dinner. They were supportive and helpful and I appreciated it. I received 3 longevity buns on the house, they tasted good.

I spent 170+ SGD for two people for dinner and I‚Äôm not sure what kind of food quality or service I should be expecting.

Upon arrival around 7pm, no one was standby at the entrance to receive us and we stood there with embarrassment for several minute till when we could not wait for longer and walked inside asking for the table.

Table cloth was dirty with dust and stains visible - no one seemed to care until I asked for a napkin to cover it.

A strong improvement area in service - male manager serving dipping with uncut filthy fingernail (no tray), staffs pouring tea with eyes away then rushed away and slow response/service when we needed water and the bill.

Food was just ok (or maybe just me with high standards coz I‚Äôm Cantonese). We couldn‚Äôt taste any basil in the three-cup chicken, the char siew was under barbecued, the signature beef cube did not come with enough wok-hey‚Ä¶ yet the crab meat fried rice was actually good.

In one word, we did not feel welcomed and/or well serviced in that place, plus the dirty table cloths and fingernail and okay taste of the food, with such not cheap price, we don‚Äôt think we will visit again."
Dinner at Golden Peony,"Excellent service from Shirlene the
restaurant manager very well taking care from her thank you so much"
"Splendid Mother's Day Lunch, Great Food, Wonderful Service","It was our first time visiting Golden Peony, and honestly, our experience left us certain that we would return again for everything that we experienced on our Mother's Day lunch. We ordered a large variety of dim sum, their Peking Duck, and their homemade bean curd, alongside some desserts. Every dish was brilliantly executed. First off, all their dim sum items which we ordered were outstanding.

Their Duo Conpoy Dumpling honestly puts ordinary har gows to shame with the sweet, bouncy yet crisp prawn filling with the breath of oceanic umami that the conpoy infuses into the whole experience. The skin was just nice, not too thick, not too thin, and most of all, translucent enough to see the gorgeous filling. The siew mai with baby abalone is another winner. The earthy and lightly sweet succulent pork, paired with fresh shrimp, and garnished with the abalone that adds a seafood-y note that elevates the flavour profile, throwing in complexity in a new way without sticking to the same script of fish roe and mushrooms, all without sacrificing flavour and quality.

I would also like to mention the aesthetic appeal of their dim sum. In particular their custard bun, red bean bun, chicken bun, and shrimp toast. I am a sucker for beautiful craftsmanship and presentation, and the adorable looks of these items made me hesitate to even eat them. However, going beyond the looks, the flavours were impeccable as well. The red bean bun was smooth, rich, and yet not oily, which is impressive given the tendencies for other restaurants to sacrifice in terms of using extra oil to gain that smooth and rich mouthfeel. Additionally, it was not too sweet, which is perfect. The custard bun was beautiful, with oozy, sweet-salty custard that coats every cranny of your mouth and smothers you with that rich, divine blanket of goodness. The shrimp toast was crisp, crunchy, and again, the brilliant blend of sweet, fresh shrimp, with crunchy fried toast, and a layer of seaweed and asparagus spears all of which worked harmoniously to deliver savoury flavours balanced by a gentle freshness and saltiness of the asparagus and seaweed, and a light sweetness from the shrimp which balances things out nicely. It was not at all oily or greasy, which is another great achievement. Same can be said for the chicken bun, which actually surprised me due to how chicken can fall flat easily, but in this case, the light marinade that it was delivered in with diced vegetables meant that what we got was a juicy and delicious bun with a crisp exterior and wonderful filling that hit all the right notes which only great fresh ingredients and top notch skill can deliver.

Moving on to their char siew bun, I will say this is the one char siew bun I have tried that has not tried to kill me with sweetness. In this case, the char siew actually shines, so you taste the smokiness of the roast meat, and in fact you can still see the char of caramelised sugars on the meat, meaning that it is not drenched in a cloyingly sweet sauce that other places enjoy doing. This is truly the char siew bun that I feel sets the right tone for everyone else to follow. I love the savoury emphasis and the celebration of the char siew itself, a far triumph over the sauce-led sorry excuses which proliferate across the market.

I will say that their beancurd skin roll is so far, one of the few I have tried that is not laden with salt. Somehow, they have managed to make sure that the saltiness of the beancurd skin is minimal, and just enough to offset the natural fragrant sweetness of the juicy prawn filling. Another winner here.

Their Peking duck is a work of art. The pancakes were thin enough, moist enough to showcase the lovely filling, and of course, the richness of the duck. The thin, crispy skin that comes alive with each chew, imparting that smoky, floral, woody aroma and wonderful texture, paired with a generous piece of thin, yet moreish duck that is completely devoid of any nasty gaminess, and the fresh cucumber and that light smear of hoisin that simply enhances everything like wrapping up a beautiful present with a wonderful wrapping paper. The sauce is surprisingly light and not cloyingly salty and sweet unlike some I have tried before. The Peking Duck left me smiling extremely widely, and my grandmother nodding her head and eating more than she ever had. If that's not enough to deliver a verdict, I don't know what is.

Their roast park is pretty good too. I would say I would have preferred greater smokiness, but with the light porkiness that contrasts with most places serving pork with heavier pungent notes, it is definitely very very very good. The crunchy skin that is not greasy again attests to how good Golden Peony is in that deft balancing act when it comes to fried and roasted foods.

I will say that there is that great feeling when one eats something as humble as tofu and vegetables and goes ""wow, this is sublime"". That's the exact feeling I got when I tucked into their homemade tofu. It was soft, delicate, yet so flavourful. A gentle sweetness and richness embodies the tofu, and it being lightly fried before serving with other garnishes means that there is a textural contrast as well with a slight crust giving way to a decadent yet delicate interior. What makes the tofu remarkable in itself is how simple it is, and how it can stand alone, with everything else working to elevate it rather than overwhelm.

I loved the duck ee mian (2nd course of Peking Duck), which was smoky, laden with wok hei, and rich beyond all levels, decadent, and of course, celebrating the duck rather than smothering it. The sauce they used for the noodles serves to highlight and emphasise the natural richness of the duck, allowing also, the roasted aromas and the floral notes of the marinade of the roast duck itself to remain prominent in the flavour profile of the dish. The ee mian was perfectly done, zero mushiness characteristic of poorly fried ee mian, and of course, the addition of chives adds a bright and fresh pungency cutting through the richness of the dish, bringing alive balance in a simple yet brilliant manner.

The desserts are also very worth celebrating. I wished I got to try their homemade gui ling gao, but regardless, I loved the silky, rich almond paste and my parents sang praises about how it was perfectly balanced, not too sweet so that the tang yuan fillings can balance things perfectly. The avocado cream with ice cream and sweet basil seeds reminded me of a tropical paradise, rich, earthy, sweet, bright, yet fresh and aromatic. The textural contrast of the basil seeds left me tempted to order more of the dish, because it was just such a delight to enjoy the creamy mouthfeel of the dish while crunching on the seeds. The restaurant's specialty mango pudding outshines all I have tried so far. I love the fact that the pudding itself isn't too sweet, relying mainly on the naturally sweet mango chunks inside it to bring the flavours to life. The sago pomelo in the sauce would have been normal, had it not been the existence of a masterstroke of the chef, an addition of fresh strawberry slices which added textural contrast, threw in bright acidity and injected a level of freshness that went beyond my expectations of how a deceptively simple mango pudding could be.

Last but not least. I must say the service here has been sincerely, the best I have experienced so far at any restaurant. Shirlene, Esther, and Vanessa were brilliantly attentive staff who listened carefully to what we wanted, and sought to make our experience as enjoyable as possible. Their food recommendations were spectacular. I appreciate their sincerity and genuineness in their recommendations, as well as their proactiveness in ensuring that our tea was filled without even needing to ask, as well as how they offered to help us pack some of the noodles when they noticed that my parents and grandmother seemed to be a little stuffed. These little gestures, coupled with their happy and positive aura, made the experience all the more memorable, as it is always a joy to dine at a restaurant with happy and motivated workers despite the challenges of the staff shortages that exist in the F&B industry. I sincerely commend and thank Shirlene, Esther, and Vanessa for making our lunch tremendously enjoyable. The service is actually the most important factor for me, in terms of whether or not I will visit a restaurant again, and in Golden Peony's case, I will most certainly come by again, not just for the superb food, but for the impeccable service with a smile."
Best in the world service,"I come regularly here because of the excellent service provided by the team led by manager Shirlene. Tonight is no exception. Same good service, same good food and same friendly service.

My wife and I had abalone starter, very good; deep fried soon hock, so tasty we have it every time and lobster mee pok you must really try.

I come because of the service and good food."
Seamless Lunch Experience,"My business partner and I had a great lunch at your Chinese Restaurant this month.

Food was delicate and service was delightful.
In particular, staff in black Jacket -Shirlene was friendly and professional.

We truly appreciate the whole lunch experience and will certainly revisit soon.

Kudos to the team and keep it up!"
Excellent Service!!!,"My favourite Chinese restaurant in town, needless to say, food is good and service is top notch. Shirlene the restaurant manager is knowledgeable, courteous and friendly, therefore always a joy to meet, she welcomes her guest with the utmost hospitality, are the greatest combo when it comes to making your restaurant experience the one and only best.
Vanes, Esther and the hold service team were excellent, polite, friendly, efficient, helpful and attentive, thereby enhancing my dining experience will certainly be back again!"
My favourite place for set dinner,"Sixth visit, as usual ordered the rediscovery menu. The rock prawns were okay but not as good as the previous visit. The kami sakura chicken soup was good. The jade perch deep fried server with orange flavour sauce was okay. Added SGD10 for the lamb and it was good, definitely worth it. The crispy egg noodles were good and finally the dessert tang yuan was good too.

Quite a while didn't get to enjoy a 5 star dining experience, not that easy to get one.
Excellent service from Miss Esther, friendly and attentive."
Friendly staff,Friendly staff and good serviceÔºÅNice environment and delicious food. Desserts are very creative. Will definitely come again.
wonderful food and an excellent service staff,"Thank. you to Esther and all the hard working staff at the restaurant. The food recommendations and wine suggestions have always been top-notch. we love the ambience and the dining environment. Besides the main √† la carte dishes, Your noodles dishes heavenly.

thank you for your great service and making it a wonderful experience to die at the restaurant."
Good selection,Nice presentation of the discovery menu. Food is good. I love the lobster crispy noodle and my wife tried the abalone rice. Special thanks to the service team who took good care of us. Service is friendly and attentive.
Birthday Celebration,"Thank you for Shirlene, Vanes Wong, Esther, Karen for always checkin in on us, warmed welcome and great service.
Good memorize and remember all our favourites."
Great Dinner,"We had a great dinner at Golden Peony. Having the Rediscovery set menu, Each of us can have diffrent choice for the dishes. Nice food and worth for price. Staff are friendly and attentive.
Thank you Vanes and Shirlene."
Love the friendly and helpful team!,"Food was always good and consistent. Thankful for Shirlene, Vanenessa, stanley and Jane for always checkin in on us especially with 2 little ones around this time round."
Birthday celebration dinner,"Good ambience as a Chinese restaurant, food quality is good and worthy for money, though you may feel the food is not hot enough, I am a person likes warm food."
My favourite place for set dinner,"Fifth visit, ordered the rediscovery set menu and topped up SGD 10 for the baked kurobuta pork. The rock prawns were really good, second time picking this dish, the freshness of the prawns quite shiok. For a change, this time picked the lobster fragrant poached rice and it was really good. Although the jade perch was not that fresh, still very satisfied, almost a perfect dinner.

If you are a big eater like me, just top up SGD10 for another extra dish, definitely worth it.

Pretty consistent food quality after eating a few times there. As usual excellent service from Eve and her team members."
CNY eve dinner,Walked in to find that decoration was tastefully done . Table was set up really nicely with many chocolates for the guests . Dishes were served hot and fresh . Service was good except for a lack of training for the part time staff .
My favourite restaurant,The food is very good at golden peony especially soups. Ambience is great too. Restaurant is kept extremely clean and tidy with tasteful deco. Restaurant manager Shirlene is very thoughtful and provides excellent service. I come here for most important events and will do so for a long time.
Amazing dinner with me and my wife,"First time there after quite a few years, was reccomended my Manager Shirlene to dine there and try out some of the chef's best dishes.

I highly reccomend this restaurant as a dining spot, as the atmosphere is great and the staff are amazing. Shirlene was very nice and accommodating to us, and made sure we were well taken care off!"
Service is good!,"The food presentation is nice, but the portion could be more for sharing compared with other fine-dining Chinese restaurants around the same value. Food quality-wise can further improve, eg. Wasabi prawn's green dip is very artificial green color not so appetizing."
Good food at Golden Peony!,"Very quality food served. Portion is reasonable too. With appropriate discounts from credit cards, it is actually quite ok in terms of the pricing.

Must try is the lobster with egg noodles."
Lunch,"Recommended for set value meal which I find it‚Äôs more value for money versus ala-carte dim sum. If you have branded bag, put behind your seat is better than beside you, as there can be accidents of spillage."
Wonderful Service,My husband and I held our wedding here and I decided to return for Dim sum with my friend. We love the impeccable service and the crew was always very attentive.
Great dinner,I joined for dinner with my family. We came back as we love the place. It was so crowded but yet we were greeted with smile. We enjoyed the dinner and great work from the restaurant.
Need to enhance client experience,"Food was good. However, need to be patient when you need attention of the service crew. Lastly, I am shocked that they only allow 1 carpark coupon redemption per table, regardless the number of diner per table. This result in a terrible client experience."
Transactional,"Came here for my dad‚Äôs birthday lunch, ordered the set menu and added on the Peking duck. It was a pretty normal experience the whole time till the second half of the meal.

What ruined the whole experience was towards the end, when one lady in suit approached our table and put the longevity buns on the table and asked ‚ÄúWhose birthday?‚Äù when I‚Äôve clearly indicated in the reservation that it‚Äôs for my dad‚Äôs birthday celebration and to be asked like that doesn‚Äôt reflect the impeccable service I‚Äôve read in the other reviews. To add on, I would have thought it is basic courtesy to wish someone happy birthday but no. The buns was placed beside my dad and the lady left without saying anything else.

On top of that, a tower of longevity buns was prepared for the other tables seated around us, and it is double standard, considering how several was crowding around to wish the diners there.

Bill was presented without us signaling for it and dessert wasn‚Äôt even served yet at this point. It gave us the feeling that you are chasing us out even though the restaurant was only 20% occupied. Furthermore, there wasn‚Äôt any indication that there‚Äôs a time limit and the lady was kind of sarcastic about it when we enquired about the rushing of food and she casually replied we were the ones who ordered late, when there were other diners who arrived and ordered later than us.

The whole dining experience felt extremely transactional.

Overall, the saving grace for this restaurant was the dishes, presentation was good, food was not too bad.

Perhaps my expectations were too high, but a reputable restaurant would definitely be more mindful of how they treat their guests."
Birthday celebration,"Birthday celebration at Golden Peony, thank you Shirlene arrangement every thing foods & service was excellent , we are so enjoy the dinner tonight."
Birthday celebration,"We had wonderful experience dining at Golden Peony restaurant.Food was good, Thank you so much Shirlene Chan excellent service provided. She was attentive and anticipation fulfilled guest need, will visit back again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."
Great food and great service,"I‚Äôve been here a few times and the food & service has never failed me. Shirlene, the general manager, was personable and made fantastic food recommendations. We followed Shirlene‚Äôs advice and had just the right amount of food."
Always a good meal here at Golden Peony,"Have not dined here since Covid started. However the standard has not dropped since then. Food and service is still up to standard. Staff are all still friendly and I really still like my fried rice over here. The char siew taste slightly different compared to last time, but perhaps that is just me. Overall I will still come back here and recommend to my friends."
Wedding Anniversary Dinner,"Came back to Conrad with my husband to celebrate our 1st Wedding Anniversary, the place where we held our banquet here 1 yr ago. A great big thank you to Chef Ku for creating such a special menu for us and Shirlene, the restaurant manager who made the arrangements for us. Also, thank you to all the restaurant team for a memorable and delicious dinner!"
Great food & service!,"Have been to golden peony multiple times. It has been a cozy and go to restaurant for us especially during the covid period. Always greeted by the friendly staff especially Eve who cares for customers and ensures that we had a great experience every time we visited. Food wise, will strongly recommend the bi feng tang chicken, crispy lobster noodle and soup. Strongly recommend to head down!"
Great experience,"Would like to thank Vanessa Wong for the coordination of our reservation, as well as Shirlene Chan, the restaurant manager.

Dinner Delight at Golden Peony,"Food is a delightful and highly delectable experience. Impeccable service especially from restaurant manager, Shirlene Chan. Highly recommend."
First business dinner at Golden Peony,"This is my first experience dinning at Golden Peony. The dishes are very unique and tastes excellent! Thanks to restaurant manager, Shirlene Chan, for helping out on the menu. Service is excellent. Highly recommended!"
Our very own Home Kitchen,"Consistently refined cuisine and excellent presentation have made Golden Peony our regular Sunday lunch escapade.

Staff remember us from previous visits and are attentive without being obtrusive. they even recall our favourite tea! It‚Äôs like dining in our very own home kitchen.

For today‚Äôs meal, Shirlene, the restaurant manager, proactively suggested payment via a particular credit card, so that we would benefit from the current best discount. Beat that!

Go ahead a treat yourself at Golden Peony. You‚Äôd be hard put to find fault even if you tried!"

Great experience always,"Excellent service provided by Shirlene and her team every visit.

Excellent lunch at Golden Peony,Visited Golden Peony fr lunch and experienced great menu selection n great service n hospitality. Shirlene who is the Restaurant Manager provided good recommendations. We had the Peking Duck which is succulent and juicy. The attention to details were superb and overall excellent team attending to our table. We will be back with the family for more great food n hospitality when we can dine out again once again.....can't wait.....
Dim sum lunch,"Service - my friend & I visited Golden Peony during COVID-19 Phase 3 - Heightened Alert (PH3-HA), where dining in is allowed for max. 2 pax. As Golden Peony lets us order dim sum by the piece, my friend had recommended that we had dim sum lunch there. Usually for dim sum, each basket will have like 3 pieces of dim sum since there's only 2 of us, it was great that they let us customise the order for 2 pax (i.e. 2 pieces, prices were charged by per piece). although there were just a few tables, there is still a little hic-cup with service staff. they served us dishes that we did not order and there were 3 pieces of dim sum on the first dish that arrived. However, that was quickly rectified. everything was smooth after that.

Food - quality of the food was great. I would say that the quality was worth the price.

Atmosphere - it was weird cos it was quiet. the restaurant was not allowed to play background music during PH2HA. the diners were placed together in the same section (with the required safe distancing). but because there was no bkground music, we could hear each other's conversation. we had to be mindful of our talking volume.

Liked best - customised order and quality of food."
Great service and good food,Had an enjoyable dinner during the HA period. Kudos to the staff for their warm and friendly hospitality!
A perfect business lunch set,"My first experience for lunch here. Dinner got it five stars, and today, it gets five stars from me for lunch as well.

We had the premium business set lunch. The nature and sequence of the items were perfectly balanced. Quantity was just nice. As usual, the chef aced in visual presentation. Flavours were appropriately potent. Staff was very attentive. Even the tea was of a good quality.

Well done!! I will be bringing more friends here‚Ä¶"
Great Dining Experience,Great service from the team always with lovely food and drink options! Will definitely be back in the future!

Dinner,Food was good and service was excellent. The manager spoke to us and made us feel welcome. Atmosphere was good - not too quiet and not too rowdy. Can feel the staff were delivering service from the heart.
Review,"Good service & food. Should experience yourself to validate my experience.
Probably dim sum variety too limited"
Birthday dinner,Excellent service with delicious food! The staffs were attentive to our requests. Would recommend to revisit
Great experience from GP,We enjoy the birthday dinner very much. Beijing duck is awesome and also the premium Jing tea is a must try. Services from the teams are great. Definitely will come back
Excellent Service makes us going back there often,"Every once in a long while, there comes a restaurant that makes us want to go back again and again. Golden Peony is one of them. Not only is the food excellent, but the service is impeccable. It is this bespoke feeling the staff at the restaurant gives us that makes us go back to them every week. I am amazed by the little things they remember of our preferences and these fine touches make every visit feels like we are dining amongst friends, and very much at home. The team led by Shirlene, supported by Stanley, Vanes, Esther and Eve, always makes us feel at home. And of course, the food: must try their sweet & sour pork and the braised fish claypot ‚Äî- simple dishes done to perfection.
Go back more often and you will be pleasantly surprised by how much they care about what is important to you when you dine there.

Great job, Shirlene & Team!"
