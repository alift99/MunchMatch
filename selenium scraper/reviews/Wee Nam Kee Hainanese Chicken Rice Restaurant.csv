It is still good chicken rice + SG zhi char,"I haven't have a warm chicken meat since they moved from Novena Regency.
It is still good chicken rice & chilli + dumpling & local kitchen dish which you can find in coffeshop house below HDB known as Tze Char (Affordable seafood restaurant in a casual setting).
I only wish that their roast chicken are warm, maybe due to their air condition in the shopping mall. Steamed(white) Chicken is definitely better in this condition"
Decent Food,"Mainly came here because a friend was in town and wanted to try chicken rice and Wee Nam Kee in Marina Square is the only option that is air conditioned in a mall, in CBD. Not the best service but food was decent, can't go too wrong with chicken rice of a supposed reputable restaurant chain."
Food OK But HORRIBLE Service!,"Customer service was terrible at this location. The server was extremely rude. Visited the restaurant on 1-15-20. Maybe because it was close to closing time that the server was rude. The website on google may have the incorrect closing time. There’s still no excuse to be rude. The server just walked up no greeting, dropped the sauces off and walked to clean a table next to where my friends and I were sitting. He comes back around and pulls out a piece of paper and pen and just stood there. Didn’t say a word. We questioned the menu and he just pointed like he we should just be able to read the menu. This was my first time in Singapore. Beautiful place, beautiful people but bad customer service at this restaurant!"
"Wee Nam Kee, a renowned chicken rice shop in singapore","Wee Nam Kee, a renowned chicken rice brand in Singapore. It has branches in Indonesia, Philippines, Korea and Japan.
Personally I prefer the roasted version rather than the poached one. The roasted chicken has a crispy skin with tender meat. Rice is fragrant and goes well with the chilli and ginger sauce provided. To have so many branches both in Singapore and overseas speaks volume about its chicken rice. The shop has other dishes in its menu as well which is pretty average. But the star here is definitely the roasted chicken rice!

Ok taste Bad survice,"シンガポール訪問最初の夜、店を訪れた。ラストオーオーダー時刻を過ぎていると思ったが、店員の女性は入れてくれた。しかし、オーダーを取りに来た男性の若者はあきらかに不機嫌。ある程度英語が話せる私でも聞き取れないくらいの速さで、オーダーを取ろうとし、あげくに、チキンライスが載った皿とスープが入った器をテーブルに投げる（本当に）始末。味は良かっただけに、最悪な体験だった。
The first night I visited Singapore, I visited this restrant. The young man came to our table and take the order but he seemed angry and spoke too fast to understand. The worst was that he thrown plates with chicken rice and bowls with soup!!!. Now we do not understand his bad behavior.The taste was ok, but the worst experience. We never ever come again, because of the man who worked on the26th Dec 2019 !!!"
Absolutely rude restaurant host.,"Absolutely rude restaurant host expecting diners to share tables and when asking for a non-shared table and the wait time, we were rudely given a non-answer. I would stay far away from this Chicken rice chain which gives Singapore Hainanese chicken rice a bad name. There are much better ones such as Boon Tong Kee or Five star chicken rice. I would rather starve then eat at this place ever."
great find!,"A rather plain looking restaurant in a shopping mall but the food!!
Loved the roast Hainanese chicken with fragrant rice, moist, tender and full of flavour, and Singapore chilli crab, YUM!
And paid only SGD$70.
Service was great and super friendly, even refused a tip
Need to go back again"
Lunch,"First time going to this restaurant and the food was just a pass. The chicken was a bit tough, like it was a bit over cooked. However the rice was really good and the vegetables was stir fried pretty well. But besides that, its nothinf special. It’s probably better if you went to a Hawker Centre instead."
Highly recommended,"There are many Hainanese chicken restaurant or eateries in Singapore. My favourite is Wee Nam Kee. The poached chicken is tender and smooth. Although the chicken rice can be better, the poached chicken made it to my top list. In Brunei, people always said TT is the best. Wait until they try this."
Very delicious and the price also no expensive,"loved the steam chicken here! ????????????.Great chicken, great service. Never miss this place when I'm in town"
Fantastic Chicken Rice,Found this place on the net. First time had to wait in a queue for 20 minutes( lunch time). However it was well worth the wait. Shared a table with some local girl who were very helpful. The set menu was a good price. In fact it was so good we returned later in the week but was early enough to beat the lunch rush
Awesome!,No frills restaurant. Very reasonable price. Value for money. Can be quite pack during peak period. Good for families and groups as they also serve other dishes. Must go place.
Insect,"Meal ruined by insect among the food and incredibly rude staff who accused us of planting it there, egregiously horrendous place, do not go there!"
Very good!,"We come to WNK at least once a month, and Jun, after we returned from the US, was no different.

Their chicken is nice and smooth, rice is fragrant, not overcooked, they have vege and other dishes to go with the chicken.

On this visit, the roast pork was a little disappointing (maybe a one off), and I encountered a member of the kitchen staff who visited the restroom, and did not wash his hands before he exited. Perhaps he washed in the kitchen before resuming duties. Hope so."
Good and inexpensive,Good food and at a reasonable price. I had the Hong Kong noodles and my wife had chicken and fried rice. All was good.
Hair in food,"Hair found in food, staff nonchalant about it, no apology, only sour faces as if we were the ones at fault"
Delicious and affordable,"The chicken rice is really good here. Wouldn’t say that it’s the best but for the restaurant setting and the price, it’s worth it! I’m more blown away by the curry fish head than the chicken haha!"
The best Hainanese Roast Chicken,"Always love go to this place. Personally I think Wee Nam Kee served the best Roast Hainanese Chicken Rice. They're succulent, crispy skin, and tasted amazing.

Don't forget the chili sauce too..... garlicky, sweet and sour..... makes my mouth water!!! We also love their wonton soup, and also the water spinach sautéed with belacan!!

Very reasonable prices!! Highly recommend when you visit Singapore!!"
The Best Ever,Have been coming here for 5 years as an expat and now back visiting on holidays! Just the best Chicken and Rice Singapore has to offer! Love Love Love!
Attitude problems with staff,"Lousy service, rude staff, charge for towels when you don’t use and when you tell them, they give you black face and say it is your job to return to the counter"
Value for money!,Delicious chicken rice and fried egg. It’s a typical zi char stall though chicken rice is their specialty. The affordable price surprises me and the nostalgic feel to the restaurant is unique. Can’t wait to try other dishes! Yummy . One of the best restaurant in Marina Square
Very Rude service,"Went alone today for lunch because the chicken rice is good. But the service was rude & bad as usual.(Went with my family before). Waitress did not bother to answer me stared at me as if they wanted to fight with me. Maybe because I was alone and they do not want to trouble themselves for a one person order. I had no choice but to walk out of the restaurant and find other place for lunch. Will never return again no matter how good the chicken are. There are lots of local chicken rice that is equally as good if not better!!
Very angry & unhappy patron."
Worth it,The food quality was way above the standard that I had expected and the fact that it tastes so good made me feel very very satisfied. The rice was savoury and chicken was very well seasoned. Recommended to bring your family along because it is also very affordable and food was amazing!
All of the chicken dish was delicious,"I went there because a lot of my friends recommended this place. We ordered the hainanese chicken, the roasted chicken and the soy chicken. They were all delicious that we managed to finish them all 😁👍"
Good,Amazing chicken rice . Good for kids and family . Highly recommended . Good price and amazing food ..
Value for money but I'm reducing one star purely based on the lack of integrity in the lady cashier.,"Food quality is good, however business integrity is equally important.

Comes in a set, very affordable and delicious.

Been eating there for years, and on more than 5 occasions, I've chosen to do a takeaway if the restaurant is too crowded.

Went about my day today and decided to do a takeaway. Ordered a set with extra rice and 3 extra eggs. Normally the extra eggs was packed in a disposable plastic bag(FOC) but this time round, the lady at the counter INSISTED to charge me for a plastic container even with i told her it would not be necessary. (Extra rice was already wrapped in brown paper and eggs separately in a disposable plastic bag).

I can afford to part with the 20 cents, but its got to do with business ethics. Why would you charge me for a redundant plastic container when otherwise its free (using a disposable plastic bag)."
Excellent Food and Service,"Wee Nam Kee was recommended to us by many people. It did not disappoint.
The food was excellent and so was the service.
Our favorite was the Hainanese Chicken Rice. It was the best that we have had during our one week visit to Singapore.....we ate here every day!"
A Must Try,"Chicken Rice is a very Singapore dish. You must try it to understand why the local rave about this food. This restaurant is probably the best place for such an experience. We tried both the white a dark versions (we liked the dark better), and it was very good. The other dishes were also very good. The restaurant is relatively small, but the food and settings were just great."
Amazingly cheap,This place is cheap and very filling. Food made fresh in front of you. This is a must for anyone wanting a quick cheap snack
Delicious Chicken Rice,This is one of the nicest Chicken Rice dishes I've had. I had the set menu with dumpling soup and the sauces provided were amazing
The place in town if you need your predictable Hainanese chicken rice fix,"I have come here several times over the years. The quality of food has been most consistent. The rice is not too oily, unlike most other Hainanese chicken rice. The chicken is exactly what you would expect - juicy, tender. Ginger is provided generously. The chilli is hot, not killer-spicy, but very good. I had wanton soup - very nicely textured and “marrow-ly”.

Business is always brisk at peak times. But good thing is, as the food gets served very quickly, tables empty quickly too!"
Singapore's Signature Dish,"Singapore's national dish is Hainanese Chicken Rice and one of those things you have to have when you visit Singapore. Business lunch and wanted local food, so Wee Nam Kee it was - and I was quite happy. The consistent good reviews are for a very good reason - the food is good, you get a lot and service is great. I recommend the boiled white chicken.

The chicken was expertly cooked and the meat moist with a simple flavor that is enhanced by the fragrant rice that has ginger and garlic. Mix the ginger, soy or chili flavored sauces that are on the table for different flavors."
I love this place!!,I was in Singapore for business and stayed at a local hotel. I found the food at this location to be extremely good and the service to be good as well. I ate at this location a couple of times and it is consistently delicious.
Great for Family,"We had our last dinner in 2018 at Wee Nam Kee Marina Square. It was busy, like usual, and the line was long, but we didn't wait too long to get a table, even though we had to share.
Food is fantastic, like always. Rice is fragrant and chicken is moist.
Surprisingly our favourite is the vegetable with oyster sauce. We finished it until the last drop.
Will be back again for sure."
Not Bad!,Rice is fragrant. Chicken is decent. The Char Siew is not very nice. Decent price for the taste. Service is ok.
Love this chicken rice,"Tried so many chicken rice in Singapore and I still feel that this is the best. Rice is full of fragrant, tender chicken and the soup is so good. If I have to pick on something, I would say that the Chili can be better ( in my opinion, not garlicky enough. I am a fan of boon tong Kee Chili sauce ( only))

Go for the soya sauce chicken. That’s the highlight to me"
Average tasting chicken rice,My 2nd time after a long while visiting Wee Nam Kee. I always see a long queue or full eatery whenever I walk past but no idea why even after trying it again. Rice is rather too oily and chicken is normal. Bought the set with roasted chicken and a plate of oyster sauce vegetable for $7. I have definitely eaten much better chicken rice than this.
Never come back here,"The outlet at Marina Square is terrible, lack of service, late food delivery even after checking with the staff 3 times. Gave wrong orders to other people who ordered after us. They were not even busy less then half the place was full. Quality of the chicken rice has dropped terribly. You are much better off eating the chicken rice just next door in the foodcourt. Do not go here waste of money and time"
Chicken Rice Not So Nice,Went for lunch at the outlet at Yishun Northpoint basement. The chicken meat is rather dry and not juicy
Local and authentic restaurant,"I went to Wee Nam Kee with friends who live in Singapore - there’s no way I would’ve come across this place by myself! It’s a fantastic ‘local’ & authentic restaurant specialising in chicken rice. We ordered so much! Steamed soy chicken, roasted chicken, chicken broth, hotplate tofu, cereal prawns, sambal kangkong and pork with salted egg yolk sauce (which was amazing). Wee Nam Kee is famous for its chicken rice sauce - a mixture of spicy chilli sauce, yellow pasty ginger & silky, thick dark soy sauce. All of the dishes were delicious and along with soft drinks cost around $80 for three people, with enough left over for lunch the next day. I recommend a visit to this restaurant next time you’re in Singapore."
Good food at reasonable price,"I sometime eat at this place for lunch. They have tasty chicken rice as well as fried dishes.
Their steamed chicken is juicy and the chill sauce adds additional flavor.
I have tried their noodle before, too. The noodle comes in generous portion, but the price is very reasonable. The place is very crowded during lunch time, but they serve food quickly.
It is definately good reasonable option in the area where there are many expensive restaurants."
Good!,A reasonable pricesd restaurant in a shopping mall! The service and food are good. Food serving is fast too. The only setback is that the table is slightly smaller. Will definitely patron again.
Very good authentic chicken rice in Marina Square,Very good & authentic. Conveniently located inside Marina Square shopping center. The side dishes were good as well and the service is fast. And price is reasonable.
Famous for the chicken rice,Simple restaurant in the Marina Square complex and it is famous for the Hainanese chicken rice. Busy at lunch time and there is usually a queue waiting to get in. Delicious choice of other dishes is also available.
Great place for Chicken Rice,"We went for a quick lunch. There was a queue in front of the restaurant but we only had to wait 5 or 6 minutes before we were greeted with a smile.
Food and drinks were all delicious, clean, fresh.
Very reasonable prices, we paid around 50$ for a group of 6. Yes, you can find it cheaper in a Hawker market but we at Wee Nam Kee you get table service and aircon included ;-)

Will definitely have this on my list of Singapore favourites now."
Enjoyable food and good service,We enjoyed a set menu of chicken rice with a dumpling soup and rice and chilli chicken. Both dishes very enjoyable and tasty. We went 2 x in a week for lunch. Nice staff. Very reasonable price and very clean.
The Tradition Continues......,"Upon arrival and checking into my accommodation at the Conrad Centennial Singapore, as a family we headed to Wee Nam Kee. A restaurant I am very familiar with growing in Toa Payoh where they first started. The outlet is in their own restaurant premises designed to look like a kopi tiam....a little kitchy but I don't mind.
The food is good ole Singapore style chicken rice. Delicious and aromatic. Every mouthful stirs the emotions of my childhood, especially seeing I don't live in singapore any more. The white chicken is classic smooth and juicy. Of all the dishes I wouldn't recommend the roast chicken which my dad wanted. The skin became soft too quickly from the sauce being poured over and I personally think the roast flavour messes with the traditional chicken rice flavour. That's just me. My sister ordered the other dishes which was great and we had barkey and lemon barley.
Service was a little hit and miss but I don't go there for the service. 4 adults and 1 child food and drinks came to just under $55. Not the cheapest for this type of food. But I am more then happy."
Tasty and Quick Service,"Ordered the half roasted chicken rice, prawn roll fritters , roasted pork and a tofu hotplate. All tasted good but the roasted chicken was the best. The rice was very flavoured too. Both food and drinks were reasonably priced. We arrived there a little later so the lunch crowd was dispersing. We got our food much quicker that way too. Highly recommended."
Crap,"If I could give zero stars, I would. Horror story begins now. Marina square outlet. Shop 1/4 filled. We came as a group of 15. They merged two tables for 12 pax. I asked if we could add one more table on the side. They said it was the manager we arrange this. I insisted that it’s not logical to force 15pax in a 12 pax table. It’s not one more but 3more. I let it go since everyone was in a good mood today. Waitress went to speak to another colleague who appeared to have more authority. But what she said next took away my hunger for that night. No joke. I literally stopped feeling hungry. First time in my life. “If you want lor. I can join this table lor. If you want.” Using two fingers and a thumb to hold a 30kg table. That’s how much she really wants to do it. I replied. It’s okay. Let’s leave it. We ordered so much that the table had no space and all these while. The two large tables beside us only sat two pax. As if it could piss me off further. Bloody table with two pax who ordered two plates of chicken rice. The other areas of the restaurant was still only half filled. The Chilli crab is crap. Best of all, the very person who mess up this experience with them. Left for home carrying his bag at 7:30pm. Which restaurant manager leaves his shop at peak hour of the operations???? My first time going to Wee Nam Kee or whatever the name it is. The rest is history."
To me.....,"Chef Chan,Tian tian, boon tong Kee are all nice in their own way. But when I crave for chicken rice or specifically soy sauce chicken rice. Wee nam Kee is the best! This version of soy sauce chicken is those thick soya sauce kind. My Son loves it a lot too!! Wee nam Kee has one of the most consistent tasting rice and chili to me. Their roast chicken is good as well! Normally I mix their soy sauce chicken with either steamed or roast chicken. A must try if you ask me"
Still the same old chicken rice I like,"Wee Nam Kee has moved from a kopitiam to a restaurant in the mall and I am expecting the price to increase but lucky me. Not too drastic an increase. The only comment I get from my friend is that the plate of vegetables cost the same as the chicken rice for 2 person... LOL
Chicken rice is still flavourful and the chicken is tender, still the same old Wee Nam Kee I love all these years. The only thing that has gone downhill is the grind ginger but I can survive without that. Please do not go there hungry because queue can be long during lunch hour and I queue for about 30mins on a weekend at 2.30pm."
Chicken rice,"I went for the chicken rice and left disappointed. The chicken was cold and the attention was bad. I asked for a napkin they said they already gave me one (a wet one), i asked for a knife and they said to use the spoon instead."
Steamed Chicken :-),"I did try many dishes, steamed chicken, roasted chicken, wonton soup, stir fried vegetable.
I would say steamed chicken is a must. Chicken is juicy.
Price is acceptable and staffs are also friendly.
It was a bit extra charge like other comments said but i was ok for me."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice (Novena),"We all know Singapore is famous for chicken rice and there lots of places selling them also! I’ve never been to Wee Nam Kee nor have I heard of them, until a friend suggested it for lunch.

The Novena outlet is quite big and has many tables, however under staffed. Went there just before noon and there was a short queue already, however with some vacant tables and only two staff on duty, things were slow!

Anyways got seated eventually and ordered one each of the steamed and bbq chicken, which comes with a bowl of soup and rice! The queue got longer at lunchtime!

For S$4.80 it’s not too bad for it’s portion size! There was nothing special about the chicken nor the rice. Infact we found the rice to be bland and un-fragrant. The soy sauce in the chicken were more of a sweet light soya sauce. The soup was nice when it was piping out, however when slightly cooled, tasted sweet also.

Verdict is it’s okay! If your out and about and want some aircon; then this place is to go, with the price and portion, it’ll feed your empty stomach until the next round of food"
famous chicken rice,"Good food, singapore hainan chicken rice is a must try whenever visiting singapore, great food at cheap prices."
Recommend Singapore dish,"Asked hotel concierge about finding a popular dish for Singapore. She recommended this chicken rice restaurant. My wife had steamed chicken and I had roasted. It included a bowl of flavorful broth. One odd thing, they don’t provide a napkin. The was a towelette delivered to the table which they charged .20 for. The also charged for a glass of water. Don’t let these items keep you from trying this restaurant or the chicken rice."
Overpriced with bad rude staff who will curse you,"Tourists beware - if you have only a few days in Singapore and wish to try the famous chicken rice, this place is NOT it.

The chicken is tough and dry and overpriced. They attempt to mask the poor quality of the chicken with lots of soya sauce.
The other dishes - beef, vegetables, pork ribs are overpriced as well with very small quantity for that price. The mixed vegetables in particular was doused with a lot of starch in the gravy to thicken the dish with a measly portion of actual veg. The beef with ginger was overcooked and in small portions.
Soup was essentially water with MSG in it and not the proper double boiled soup served in other Chinese restaurants. It appeared that they are cutting corners on the food quality and portions while still pricing it at the typical chicken rice restaurant prices.

The worse thing about this place is the service staff. They are curt and arrogant. We were shouted at to wait for our food by a bossy fat woman in a yellow apron and black spectacles, when we asked to check on our order after 40 Min, and while the patrons that came after us were served their full meal.

When we asked for our drinks to be served to us at least, she brought us our drinks and placed them on our table with a loud bang and cursed at us loudly in Mandarin. Shocked at her attitude we beckoned the manager who looked afraid to get involved and signaled to us repeatedly to engage that staff for anything we needed. Just as we intended to walk out, the food appeared and the plates were literally handed to us by the kitchen staff at our eye level as they did not bother to bend over to place it on our table for us.

Atrocious service from this place. You would do better trying the food at the food court next door. At least you would be paying for what you get, without paying the additional service tax for abysmal service.

Tourists - do try the chicken rice at a real hawker centre instead of this makeshift restaurant."
Reasonably priced in a tourist area,Pretty crowded restaurant. We arrived at 8pm and still had to wait. Ordered 2 different kinds of chicken - the steamed one and the roasted one and they were both delicious. My friend ordered some chicken stockings for $1 or so..
Family trip to Singapore,"My buddy introduced me & family to this authentic Hainanese chicken rice in Marina Square. We all just love it! The steamed and soya sauced chicken are delicious. We went back there for second time and it was great!
Must try this outlet if you're looking for nice authentic Hainanese chicken rice!
Keep up the good taste!"
Fragrant rice but average chicken,"Somehow, the famous chains of chicken rice restaurants like Wee Nam Kee and Boon Tong Kee have not been upholding the quality of chicken rice in Singapore.
For a plate of chicken rice averaging >$7, one does not get tasty or fragrant chicken meat. The chilly is also not up to par...so paying so much just for the rice isn't quite worth it."
Always A Good Option,"I'd say it's a hidden gem amongst the tonnes of eateries in Marina Square. It's tucked away on the top floor of the mall on the same floor as the massive food court. The restaurant is always churning out the same delicious quality of chicken rice every time I visit regardless of the long queues that snake down to the mouth of the escalator.

My hot button with chicken rice is the flavour of the rice itself. If the rice isn't tasty to eat it on its own, then it's not good chicken rice. As for Wee Nam Kee, I can definitely eat the rice on its own and do can my colleagues. The chicken is of decent portion - unlike other stores where there's more bone than meat - and the price does not poke a hole in your wallet. Even if you were to dine by yourself, a simple plate of chicken rice comes to less than SGD5.00. Worth it!"
Service????,"I was attracted by recensions for this restaurant, but i first of all had difficulties to find it, because it was inside the commercial centre, and local people did not know it. When finally found and taken table, I have been disappointed for the service. The waitress was requested to explain different dishes and suggest me, but she was a piece of ice and her english was very bad. At the end i ordered what i already knew.....and luckly the quality was good!"
Delicious chicken rice and great service,"Thanks to the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel. My wife and myself had a taste of the famous Singapore dish chicken rice. Was introduced few local home-cooked dishes as well.

Although the waiters and waitresses seem to be struggling to explain the ingredients used in our dishes, we seriously appreciated that a lady uses google translate to explain to us in English. Service could be better."
Good place for dinner with friends at Marina Square,"Overall standard has dropped but queue is still as Long.. expect 10-15 minutes waiting time at Marina Square. Especially the soup of the day, Black Bean Soup, $6 pales in taste and ingredients."
Great chicken rice and more,"Came here for a late lunch on a weekend. Was still relatively full so had to wait just an bit for a table. Service was quick and attentive. Had the steamed chicken (e.g. Chicken rice; chicken was tender as it should be), the salted egg prawns (which were really good) and braised tofu and vegetables (excellent as well). If you want reasonably priced local Chinese food, this is one place you should visit."
Best chicken rice,"Have been to this establishment several times and having tried many other chicken rice stalls/restaurants, we seem to gravitate to Wee Nam Kee as our go to place each time we visit Singapore.
This is a busy little restaurant on the same floor as the food court. Because it is a stand alone restaurant, you cannot order food from the outside stalls.
There is usually a 15-20 minute wait to get a table and it was no different the evening we visited.
Apart from chicken rice, they also cook a variety of other dishes but the chicken is the stand out dish.
If you want to try great chicken rice in Singapore, I highly recommend this restaurant."
Good chicken rice,Good chicken rice for reasonable price. Can be a bit of wait through out the day but line moves pretty fast.
Best Neighbourhood food joint but crowded,"Fragrant chicken rice and tender chicken. Surprise to find the stir fried crab was beautifully done. The chefs are definitely versatile and very experienced. I come here one a week and it's my Neighbourhood kitchen.
However can get quite crowded. Sometime I have wait for quite a while even for a take out. Food runs out fast as well especially the livers.

A definite try."
Chicken rice,"I wanted to eat chicken rice and found this shop in Marina Square. It was not too crowded and the waitresses helped me to find a table. I ordered roasted chicken drumstick with rice. The chicken is juicy but with some blood, depending whether you are ok to see some blood on the bones or not. Overall the chicken rice was good and at reasonable price."
Cold chicken served,"Came here for good cheap eats. The service and restaurant environment are great, but was disappointed when I tasted the cold chicken. The soup and rice are tasty. I actually had to dump the chicken pieces in the soup to warm them up before putting them in my mouth. Great place for hanging out with friends and family. Hopefully they can make sure the chicken meats are warm before they serve (possibly because I was going there for dinner so the chicken are already cooled hanging in the air for the whole day. Given the rave reviews they receive over their chicken rice, the food shouldn't be served cold). I also love their hot barley, tastes great (authentic) and not too sweet. If the chicken is not served cold, their chili and minced ginger would make the food tastes great."
Cravings satisfied,"Celebrated my girlfriend's birthday here. Though this is not a usual ""date"" place, it can satisfy big appetite for chili crab and cereal prawn."
Fragrant chicken rice at Northpoint,This outlet in Northpoint has just opened for business. I had the roast chicken rice which cost me $4.80. The chicken is soft and tender and the skin lightly crisp. I love the fragrant soft rice which has a light brown colour to it. There was a small container of chilli sauce that comes with the rice but I would also like some minced ginger - it was not given. Only for those dine-in customers. It was crowded even on weekdays so be prepared to wait and queue for your turn.
Favourite to go restaurant for chicken rice,"Food is always consistent . Chicken juicy and succulent . Rice is always fragrant and I always help myself to another serving . You can get more soup for free , so I suggest not to buy any other soup . Great work and well done !"
Chicken Rice in Singapore,"Every time we stop by Singapore, we usually stay at the Conrad, and walk over to the mall and have lunch at Wee Nam Kee. The place serves good chicken rice for a cheap, cheap price!"
Best Chicken Rice in Singapore,"I had my doubts when I see the place. It looked like a regular Chinese food eatery, plus it's just chicken rice. How good can it be?

When I tasted the their specialty chicken rice, I totally understood the suggestions about this place from my friends and family. The chicken was perfectly cooked and succulent, the juice dripping from the skin was enough to act as the condiment and nothing else. There were other dishes that I ordered such as the roast pork belly and stir fry kale, which all were great, but the chicken rice easily top the chart.

I took my friends there whenever they visited Singapore ever since and they all loved it as well."
Yummiest chicken rice in town!,"Yummiest chicken rice in town! Well, we visited the one in Novena area. We ordered steamed chicken, hainanese rice, cha siu, dumpling soup and veggie. My most favorite dish is the chicken rice. You need to queue to get your table though. Although it looked like a verrrry long queue but the staffs were efficient and fast! We got our table less than 30 minutes. Worth try wait and try!"
"Very fast service, tasty food","I went with some friends to Wee Nam Kee and we shared roasted chicken, sweet and sour pork, chicken livers, vegetables and more. The rice was very tasty, all the food was very good. Chili sauce was hot and flavorful."
Fresh prawns!,"I loved the prawns with cereal. Very tasty. Service was okay. I did not have any problems with anything about the service. The place was full but lucky enough to be seated quickly as there was 1 table available. Service staff asked if I needed rice with my prawns, a good cue for customer info. Otherwise i would have waited again for an order of rice had I were not asked. This place will be in our list of resto to go to every visit to Singapore from now on."
"Lousy Service, Unfriendly Staff but Famous among tourists","There are many dangerous effects of having bad customer service and its sad to see that they are highly praised for their humble reputation on their website and Facebook.

This is my 2nd time observing a boss-like staff exerting *his & her* power over a junior staff by raising their voice and pin-pointing their mistakes openly. This is extremely embarrassing, intimidating and unprofessional.

Indeed ""It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it"".

Food is average. Roasted chicken is dry and no longer tender as compared to the past. Chicken rice was too moist and no fragrance.
We tried the Wee Nam Kee pork chop as well. Miserable portion for a (L) size. Salad dough fritters was hard and chewy.

Definitely not the best Hainanese Chicken Rice stall around."
My Favourite chicken rice,They have a few outlets but I always go to the Novena branch (cause it's air conditioned and it's somewhat in The Central). I like the roasted chicken rice and fried you tiao (with squid paste inside)! The prices are really affordable! No service charge! But they do charge you for the wet tissue (0.20 cents for one).
Chicken Rice,I'm still not sure why everyone seems to think that Chicken Rice is any big deal. We thought this dish was really going to be something special so we went to this restaurant inside the Suntec Mall in the food court. What we got was one plate with sliced chicken breast on it and another plate with white rice on it. No secret sauce or anything special. The dish is pretty ordinary in my opinion
Singapore Chicken Rice..,The Hainanese Chicken Rice at Wee Nam Kee very tasty and the i like the roasted chicken. For sure one is not enough..
Authentic Chicken Rice - Recommended for Tourists!,"For tourists visiting Singapore, this is one of the must go places to have your plate of the famous Chicken Rice. The price is very reasonable and many locals actually visit this restaurant as well. Highly recommended and prices are very friendly as well!"
Very Good,"I came at 2pm, public holiday with my wife and 2 kids. I read a few negative feedback about their service. I am a tourist myself and I did not find anything wrong about how they treat people. Some tourist need to understand that this restaurant is busy and this is singapore where it is common people talk to you directly with their singlish which may sound ""different"" to some people from other part of the world.

I like this restaurant it represent Singapore style Hainanese Chicken Rice and the Porks as well as the squid, when I was there, the service was decent. As a matter of fact it was slightly above average than the other typical restaurant

I am happy to give them 5 stars"
Excellent Hainanese Chicken and Rice,"We came here to try their chicken over rice before boarding our cruise ship and we were not disappointed. The chicken was smooth, tasty and not dry. Add the condiments of a little soy sauce, ginger & garlic and a little chili sauce plus the coconut flavored rice, you got one heck of a meal. The place was relatively crowded as locals also frequent this place so you know it's pretty good. And to top it all, you do not have to dine in the dreadful Singaporean heat as this place is air conditioned so you could eat in relative comfort. If you like Hainanese chicken, this is the place."
Was blamed for not making a reservation,We made do w a table for 4 for 8 of us. There were some unhappiness but what takes the cake is that there was a table for 6 with 2 adults only n the guy who brought us to the table blamed us for not making a reservation??!!!
Hainan chicken rice,This is more or less like boon tong kee . I miss their bbq pork which my friend told me very good. Will be back to try that
Distgusting staff,"Staff is rude, extremely racist and disgusting. I was welcomed in with a hostile look and a Yes? Menu was thrown on my table, food was thrown on my table. Looking at the pictures here on trip advisor of the same dish i ordered, i can see that i also got a much, much smaller portion + the food was Luke warm. What a sick, disgusting type of people run this place. It is truly worrying that such people even exist on this globe. Don't go here unless you are Chinese. Most certainly don't go here if you are black."
Best Chicken Rice,"Totally have enough with chicken rice since I brought my family over & over again to boon tong kee until we tried wee nam kee. The flavor is refreshing! The chicken is very tender, roasted skin is light & crispy, soy sauce is well balance between savory & sweet and garlic chili is perfecting the whole dish. They have white or roasted chicken rice, personal set or half / whole chicken and also other chinese food menu. Price is affordable, portion is ok too. Avoid meal times if possible or prepare to queue."
So yummy,"This is our first meal when we just arrived in Singapore. I love chicken so much. Therefore I chose this one without any second wondering. Chicken was so fresh and tender which combine perfectly with soya sauce. The soup was great with nice broth. Strongly recommend this place. Very clean, nice staff, excellent services."
Best Hainanese Chicken I've Had,"My partner and I are from New York City and came here to sample what we were told was great Hainanese chicken. We both loved the roasted and soy sauce versions it the chicken and the dark sauce was amazing. The restaurant is simple, clean, bright and bustling and the food was great and a great value. I wish we had this type of food available in New York. I would eat it every day."
A Convenient Place For My Chicken Rice Fix,"The restaurant is conveniently located on the 4th level of the Marina Square It is always very crowded during lunch and I always make it a point to be there early. The Chicken rice is consistently very good. They have a very reasonable set for lunch which is comparable to food court prices. Very good value for money and service is both friendly and fast. Every time when there are overseas visitors that craved for chicken rice, this is the place I will bring them to."
One of the best boiled and steamed chicken restaurants,One of my highlights to Singapore was to eat the Hainanese chicken rice. My wife loved it tremendously. The boiled white or dark soy sauce chicken meat is so tender and juicy. The rice is cooked in its juices and so fragrant. The ginger and chili paste is to die for if you care for the hot stuff. We ordered half a chicken for the 4 of us plus you can order other Chinese Cantonese dishes like vegetables or pork/beef. Ask them for recommendations.
Chicken is so-so,"Visited the United Square branch in November 2016 to try out this infamous chicken rice. I did not find the white chicken to be anything fantastic. The ones I had in Boon Tong Kee and a restaurant next to Raffles Hotel were more exciting to eat.

Soup was not bad. Service was a little slow, with incoming patrons hardly noticeable hidden behind a feature wall near the entrance. Waiters were not very friendly, they were focused more on delivering orders quickly..."
Decline,"Alas, the kitchen has declined and they've become lazy enough to use MSG for the chicken soup. Simply unacceptable. The chicken is tender but the accompanying sauce has lost its aroma, being overwhelmed by saltiness."
Ok but not fantastic,"Wee Nam Kee has been around since 1989, and is currently situated in an air-conditioned eatery at United Square.

Their specialty is chicken rice. The white chicken which we ordered was flavourful but a little fat. The rice was a little too moist. We also ordered several other dishes like fish head curry, baby kailan (a green leafy veg), hot plate tofu and some chicken giblets. The standard of cooking of ok for an average Chinese cooked food store (as opposed to a Chinese restaurant), but then again nothing really special. One of the most important components of good chicken rice is the chilli sauce. The sauce served here was traditional but lacked oomph.

The wait staff seemed to be mainly mainland Chinese, so communications might be an issue for non-Chinese speakers, although the manager is a local and very friendly. Queue management was somewhat chaotic that evening, seeing that they don't take reservations and have a very basic queue line in which at least 1 family cut the queue.

Having said the above, the place continues to be very popular with locals and tourists alike. But there are far better places out there serving great chicken rice without all the other main course add ons."
Nice chicken rice but service needs improvement,"Been to this place a few times and the chicken rice is nice with a variety of chicken - steamed, roasted or braised in soya sauce. The curry fish head is pretty good too. Come for the food but the service is pretty bad. Not sure where they find the waitresses from but there's this one who shows her bad attitude and it definitely sucks. If this was a cheap and nasty place then I wouldn't have mind putting up with chappy service. But the prices do not reflect a cheap and nasty place and therefore something needs to change. Perhaps that's why it isn't as busy as it used to be during lunch hour."
Thumbs up,A thumbs up to their hainanese chicken rice. My daughter loves it and my son love their rice. He only ate the rice and almost finished two order of it. The stir fried beef is also good. The assorted veggies is also good. You can also order fresh coconut juice. The overall experience is thumbs up.
Tender chicken ever!,"Tender chicken with light tasty sauce, it goes super well with fragrant chicken rice. Whether you order white chicken or roasted chicken, even once I ordered all chicken breasts, they still taste very delicious! Most people go for their rice, some people will order noodle it also serve with the famous chicken. I like their wanton type noodle too. They serve home-made chili paste, and ginger paste for you to serve with the chicken as you like. Fresh food, fast service, reasonable price. Must try!"
Farewell Dinner for a Friend,"The food is excellent and there are quite varieties not only chicken rice. However, the chicken rice is great. Also the other vegetable dishes are also fantastic. The services are okay as a whole."
