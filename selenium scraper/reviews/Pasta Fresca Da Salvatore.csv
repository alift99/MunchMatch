Quality food and attentive service,Pleasant experience. Quality food and good service. Clean environment and the waiters were polite and responsive.
"Good service, good food",The pasta was fresh and I especially liked the squid ink seafood with white wine sauce. The steak was perfect.
Dinner at Boat Quay,"The restaurant seems to be short-handed, which is not uncommon. Tiramisu is good but I prefer it on a plate with beautiful decor rather than in a glass tub. Pasta dishes were good although a little salty, esp. Carbonara."
EXCELLENT SERVICE,"The server or restaurant manager was very friendly, thoughtful and detailed with the menu. Thank you"
"Amazing food, and very good service.","The grilled eggplant is amazing. And, to me, the white-wine base pasta is the reason why I will come over again,Must TRY!"
Great Service and Food,Best cream-based pastas in Singapore. The meatless dishes are the true star of the restaurant. Affordable price and even the beers or antipasto sharing platters are value for money while not compromising on quality. great ambience beside the river.
Family Lunch,We chose this restaurant because it offers a choice of vegetarian dishes. We were seated strait away and the food was served quickly which was great and value for money.
Perfect italian pasta,"I went two times in one week to salvatore.
Both times i got perfect fresh pasta. And the sauces tasted fresh as well, like in italy. The wine comes temperated, which is important in this hot weather. If you got a table by the river, you have also a great view. The only thing that could be improved is the size of the portion (it was both times alittle small)."
Nice pasta,Will recommend the Al Samone. Bolognese is alright. We went at an earlier time(6pm) so there were no queue.
Authentic Italian Recipes,"Seated pretty quickly. Since we were vegetarians, they suggested optoins available. Pasta in Marinara sauce was superb. Thin crust pizza was also good. Good fast service. prices are a bit high."
Limited choice rather pricey,"We went for dinner on a quiet weekday evening. As vegetarians, we wanted to share a pizza. The waiter recommended one, but came back 10 minutes later to say that it wasn't available. There were only 2 other choices; the Vegetariana Pizza which we chose was average in consistency and taste. The third member of our group chose a grilled vegetable dish, which she enjoyed. Beverage prices were too high for such a locale. The waiter was polite but slow, and seemed too anxious to clear the table while we were just finishing. We did appreciate being welcomed by the owner Mr Salvatore."
Lovely Ambience with Delicious Food,Restaurant was beside Singapore River so there is a lovely river view. Risotto was delicious as usual but this time round the pasta was a little overcooked and not Al dente. But the service from the crew is excellent!
Customer experience getting worst,"Visited 17 Apr 2022, we asked seat change due to the hot weather. Chinese Male Service Staff made changing seats feel like a crime, gave a funny face when we asked to move in to the aircon area. And he even told us no changing of seats anymore in a rude manner. Their air con was not really working, he gave us a lousy seat. They dont take feedback seriously. Totally disastrous experious. This probably will be my 3rd and last time visiting the restaurant."
Amazing Experience at Pasta Fresca,Had a good experience here at Pasta Fresca. The food was amazing as well as the drinks. Staffs were friendly and polite
First time customer and we will be coming back again!,"We were served by Alex and she provides a great smile during serving. Since food ,ambience and service is nice , we will surly come back again. Hope to be served by her again! 😊"
Poor service!,"Poor service! If you are looking for a place where some guests have finished their dishes before the others are served, this is the one."
Excellent,Childhood pasta still tastes the same old <3. Mrs loved it too! The cheese was on point. Seafood pasta was spot on for the taste
Great Experience Everytime,"Food is done really fine, service is good and prompt. This is probably my third or fourth visit. The food never fail to impress."
The place for homemade pasta,"You will be overwhelmed with the choice of homemade pasta at a reasonable price that you don't get to see much outside. Their pasta comes with different fillings too. comfort or adventurous pasta, your choice!
Have some calzone here too if you are not too full ;)"
One of the my personal favorites! Nice place - good views - friendly staff!,We used to go there every Wednesday and friday for freeFlow of food and drinks buffet! They dont do it anymore but I should give it a review! Always good times and tasty food and drinks! come to check it out! cheers!
Had a dinner at this place,"Had a dinner at this place (Pasta Fresca) with some friends and we enjoyed the dinner. The food, view from outside dining area were lovely. The staff by the name of Ms. Alex, was so nice and polite to us. Will recommend this place to some friends and will come back definitely!

-Joe"
Alex good host,"Great service that make Italian food perfect I love the salmon pasta and pizza we will back sure

She’s great with a great team of co workers

Kind and smiling
The manager is kind as well

Thanks to Alex from Philippines who give excellent service"
Alex was excellent great food in this place,Alex was excellent She make us dine and even order wine cos she’s kind and sweet very impressive... she’s professional and great service
"Great food, wonderful service","Their calamari is a must-try! The portion is generous and the arrabiata sauce that comes with the calamari is delicious.

The pasta portions are huge as well! The lava cake was a great end to the meal. Crusty outer layer reminds me of a cookie, with molten chocolate oozing out. Absolute yum.

However, what impressed me most was the wonderful service. We had a lovely alfresco dining by the river and our wait staff, Jia Wei, was an absolute charm. He was really attentive and gave us recommendations. Really friendly! :)"
good food and excellent staff,"we walked past this restaurant a couple of weeks ago , not looking for a meal, and were shown the menuby a waiter called Jim or Jia Wei. We said we might be back the next day and there was a brief conversation about where we were going -- in fact to the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. We did pass on our way from the hotel the nest day and Jia remembered all about us, gave us a table right next to the river and was super professional.

Good food

The neighbouring pub too noisy but you can't have everything.

If you don't want the noise the interior dining room is lovely and quiet and air conditioned"
Birthday lunch,"Awesome service from the staff, food was good, environment is good too. Staff even sang me a birthday song, and hes pretty good at it too! 👍🏻👍🏻"
"Nice location on the river, good food and service","Went here for dinner after looking at the reviews. Great location but because of the virus it was not busy, had a good table by the river. Service was Excellent, Bruschetta, Arancini, Pizza Funghi an Capricciosa all very good, Nice Italian red wine too. Would recommend"
Good Location & Excellent Service,Excellent Customer service by Manager Dino. Food was good & value for money. Great location with lovely riverside view.
"Great location, but just average food.","We only tried this restaurant once whilst staying at the Fullerton Hotel.
We wanted a change from Thai food etc, so tried an Italian, well Singapore version of Italian.
The location is lovely, sitting on the river front, opposite the old colonial section of the city.
The staff aren’t the friendliest of waiters we’ve come across, and the menu is very limited, also quite expensive for virtually street food.
Anyway, the food came fairly quickly, but it was nothing special, certainly had a lot better, and worst, so for us, it was just very average."
A great evening with pizza,"The service was great. Koh Jia Wei, our waiter, and the chef entertained our mildly odd order, and 4 of us had a great time. Thank you!"
Great evening,"We enjoyed dinner here. Lovely riverside position, nice food, friendly service. It worked for us! Thanks to Man who managed our table."
Lunch executive menu,"Lunch executive menu was decent for $19.90 with soup/salad, mains (pasta/pizza) and gelato. Choices were limited to shell pasta with either aglio olio or pomodoro (tomato base). Mare e monti was good and very flavourful but pricey at $22.90 ala carte for lunch."
JUST OK,"This restaurant is just OK. Nothing special.
We got tired of eating the local cuisine and were looking for some European food. Went in to have a Salad and a couple of pasta dishes.
Quality was OK. Service was OK. Price was a little high, but this seems to be the norm in Singapore."
Great pasta,"Excellent pasta, one of the best Bolognese I’ve ever had. My wife had the canneloni and the kids had carbonara and quattro fromaggi. Resonable prices."
Good,"Went there on New Year’s Eve, Nice ambient place with great pasta! Pizza was also good. Friendly staff"
Best Italian,"Quality never change. Every time I dine it, always has that delicious meals. The best italian restaurant I ever had in Singapore"
Food good but service need to improve,Food is good but cowokers need to improve their service. One staff just kick the door out and service customer.
"Fabulous location, good varied menu.",Had a table by the Singapore River which was great. The food considering the location is reasonably priced and above average. The mushroom risotto was perfectly cooked if a little bland.
Exallent food,We have enjoyed excallent food and service in this restorant . Recommended to visit . Ham its delicious but it could be more dry . Owner and staff are very friendly . Espresso its good quality
Beautiful location - good food,"When we arrived for dinner, the tables directly at the river, were occupied. We took a table on the street side and asked the waiter, to inform us as soon as a table at the river would be free. In the meantime we selected our food. Less than 10 minutes later, we were seated at a table directly at the waterfront with a fantastic view to the river and the skyline at night. Perfect service! The food ( Bruschetta, Pizza,..) was very good - fresh and real Italian taste. The portions are sufficient and the prices are not cheap, but adequate for Singapore."
"Beautiful setting, good food..","Was here for a lunch and for dinner, enjoyed both times. Friendly staff and manager, helpfull and attentive. Tasted different dishes and everytime the pasta, meat,.. was done like it should be. Waiting times ok and prices normal. Its a location next to the river. Perfect in every way."
Good italian in Boat Quay,Decent good quality italian restaurant in Boat Quay! The food quality and taste is very good and it completely passes the italian mark! Good steak and different pasta dishes to choose from with fabulous dessert!
chunky seafood soup,"had their seafood soup for lunch, which is primarily a tomato based soup filled with chunky pieces of seafood (mussels, clam, prawn, squid, etc.). was very tasty, but not very filling for $22.90++"
Disappointing,"We went here for dinner and on sitting at the table saw that the food at other tables looked lovely, so thought we were onto a winner. Our waiter brought menus over and then left us for far too long and after getting his attention and asking to order drinks he never bothered coming over. Eventually we asked a waitress(who apparently was the manager) and got our order taken. Next we ordered the food. There were 3 of us there and to be fair 2 out of the 3 mains were good, however, the third dish, a lasagne, was cold and after alerting the waitress we were told we would get a fresh one. When the second dish came along (after a considerable wait) this had burnt cheese on top and some of the pasta was hard. We complained again and received an apology and asked if we wanted anything else. We declined and asked for the bill, we were told we wouldn’t be charged for the lasagne and quite rightly so and she gave us a discount of $4SGD, not sure how it was worked out as was told it was 10% but as the bill was just short of $90SGD that wasn’t quite right. Will never go back to this restaurant and will advise others to stay clear. Very, very disappointing."
Excellent Italian,"My family ate here fr lunch one day and it was delicious. The location is perfect in Boat Quay, with river views and outdoor seating if you choose. Service was also good, I'd definitely eat here again."
Best Italian restaurant in Singapore,"I visited this place in Mar 2019, Location, food, hospitality all very good, I met Mr Devendra Rana there, (manager), He is a very wonderful person, staff are pro,"
No service for 1 hour,"Pasta Fresca is well situated on the banks of the Singapore River at Boat Quay. I popped in for lunch on a Thursday around 1pm during the course of an ordinary business day.

The restaurant was almost completely empty (see photo below). Staff seated me at a riverside table (see second photo below) and then ignored or forgot about me for 1 hour despite being completely empty.

These guys are simply the doziest wait staff I’ve ever come across. Stupidity beyond belief. If it takes an hour for your order to be taken, God only knows how long it takes them to prepare the food. If you want to have any chance of eating and getting out within 5 hours of being seated, avoid this place like the plague!"
A very good italian restaurant,"The restaurant is located in Boat Quay. There was a very good atmosphere, Salvatore is friendly and the staff was helpful. I was in Spore for a business trip and with my collegue we came twice. We sat outside and the tables are situated on the Quay and you get great views of the light shows on the water. Pastas the the pizzas were very tasty and the tiramisu was wonderful :)"
Great ambience and food,"Service was great, staff were attentive and the food was served fast. My friend was vegetarian and she felt that the options were excellent."
great food and nice location,"Nice meal by the quayside - ate early so managed to get a waterfront table so lovely views - had lasagne, salad & garlic bread + a couple of soft drinks and it came to £65 which is about average for the location - excellent service"
Nice deserts here!,Big thanx to Mr Jacopo for great conversation! Panna cotta was really like true Italian ! Coffee is good Try to come one more time P. S. True Italian place!
Good food but service can be improved,Good food but service can be improved. Love that they had so many pasta options! Our took really Long to come when others who came later had theirs first.
Always a delight,"It had been a very long while since we decided to have a meal again at Pasta Fresca, but it didn’t disappoint once again.

Basically it’s simply a delight to be able to choose your fave fresh pasta with your fave sauce. You just can’t go wrong and the taste is always great.

Just don’t forget to leave space for their tiramisu dessert ... simply delightful !

If you’re lucky to be able to sit at riverside the ambience truly adds to the lovely meal.

Thanks Pasta Fresca for nót disappointing us"
Lovely Valentine's Day dinner,Group of 4 had dinner here for Valentine's Day. It was lovely sitting outside near the river soaking up the atmosphere. We had a selection of pizzas and pastas. All were very nice indeed. Reasonably priced and good service.
Italian food for Chinese clients,"I am Italian on a business trip ans sometime I look for good Italian restaurants. I tried this because I liked the location, one of the waiter is Italian and the photos looked good.
I ordered plain bread (in Italian restaurants plain bread is normally served on the table included in the price) and I was brought a plate of toasted bread with butter. A good indication of Italian restaurant for non Italian customers.
I ordered linguine mari e monti (which means sea and mountain). They were over cooked and so sweet I could not finish them. The cook obiously put sugar in the sauce and lots of sweet cream. Maybe good for the local taste, but Italians stay away!"
Lovely meal,"Situated in Boat Quay. Great atmosphere, staff were friendly and helpful. We sat inside but the outside tables are situated on the Quay and you get great views of the light shows on the water. Pasta was delicious and the pizzas were very tasty. Not too expensive"
Italian cuisine with right taste !,"There are plenty of Italian food in Singapore but this place is right for one thing - you can make it spicy !! ., while ordering. Cheese - one of the finest and apt one ! Go for it. Riverside view also adds the level of comfort."
Best pasta in Singapore,"The best Italian pasta with the greatest view of Singapore river.... Don’t live the place without tasting the best tiramisu in town Thanks to Giacopo, the manager!"
Best Italian food in Singapore,Typical and excellent Italian food. Great atmosphere and high quality service. As an Italian food lover I found back all the traditional flavors that I like. PS: Truffle Ravioli was amazing!
Great pasta place,Fun place to have pasta and other italian dishes. The pizza served here is amongst the best in Singapore.
Decent pasta but average pizza,I came here for lunch with some friends in late December. Perhaps because of the time of year the set lunch options advertised on the website weren't available - we didn't really get a proper explanation when we asked. So instead we were stuck with the relatively more expensive prices of the regular menu. My pasta was decent and I quite enjoyed it. But we also ordered a prosciutto pizza which was really disappointing: hardly any ham on the pizza and it looked like it had come out of a can. So I'd recommend sticking to the pasta if you come here.
Favorite Italian Restaurant in Singapore,"My fiancé and I love eating here. We enjoy the exceptional service that Jacopo provides along with the rest of the staff. With the way Jacopo approaches you and communicates, you can tell he is genuinely Italian and knows his dishes. He always recommends dishes we end up loving and makes us come back for more. They also can customize a meal that suits your taste even if it is not on the menu.

I highly recommend this spot for pasta and pizza! (Thats all we order and of course wine) They know what they are doing, especially since they have been around for more than 15 years. You will not be disappointed! Molto bene!"
Fav Italian restaurant,"This is my family favourite Italian restaurant. It is 5 mins walk from my house and has been here for 15 years. The service, speed and quality of food are great. They renovated last year and ambince isn’t good for family celebration meals. Must try.

Note: they will move to nearby Guthrie House as the condo/buikding building has been enbloc and will be redeveloped."
dinner,The most amazing Italian food in a fabulous position. Delicious. Highly recommend the arabiatta. Beautiful wine. Great place.
Fantastic,My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our evening at Pasta Fresca. Deliciously prepared pasta and pizza paired with fabulous Tuscan wine. The staff were friendly and on the ball and really looked after our every need. This will go down as one of our favourite dinner spots in Singapore.
"The Service is Good, The Food are not bad","This is my second visit here, the first time i came it was at night.. so crowded. And now i came in the noon, and we got to sit near the river. The staff is really friendly and give a very detailed explanation when i asked. Thankss! I like the pizza we ordered, noms, but i guess the Chef Recommended soft shell crab pasta taste dropped.. last year it was impressive to me. This year not so much. Anyway"
Great Pasta,"Great place with great food, great (italian) staff and great view. If you like pasta you wi love this place!"
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “Better than Italy”,"Really astonishing tastes! I’m Italian and I know how pasta needs to taste.. thanks to Jacopo’s courtesy, I had the opportunity to eat ravioli with burrata, porcini mushrooms and truffle.. what an experience! Highly recommended."
Amazing pasta and special service,"The position, the quality of the food and also the service have been special. Thanks to Jacopo that helped us in choosing the best dishes following our tastes. He let us feel like in Italy, thank you"
Fantastic pasta! And great service!!,Visited today and had the crab meat pasta whilst my friend had the seafood pasta. Honestly both of us were very impressed. The waiter was very knowledgable and food was well worth it. The service was great and it’s ideally located. Will fir sure go back again!
Nice pasta!,Enjoyed the pasta. Good location along the river. Good variety of dishes on the menu. Prices are a little high. Will return.
Tasty,Nice location next to the river. Friendly service (even Italian!). Pasta real good Al Dente! We‘ll be back!
A scent of Italy in Singapore,"The Public Relations Manager heard us speaking Italian and invited us to visit the restaurant. We did it the following evening. The pizza was great, as well as the tiramisu (thanks Salvatore!) - a scent of Italy in Singapore :) The location is wonderful!"
Smoking tables pls??,"Used to be a great place to be at.. till they decided to stop have smoking tables there. Been a regular since but sad, smoking tables no longer available. It’s nice to sit by the river, enjoy great food and wine after a busy day at work. Service is great! Food is a wow! But I greatly hope, they would consider bringing back the smoking tables like they used to have or perhaps get tables like their neighbours next door where customers can enjoy smoking and dining too?"
"Great position, great service, good food but missed the mark somewhat","I ate at Pasta Fresca on the Singapore River Boat Quay with my adult daughter.

The soup of the day that I had was really good, her minestrone was just ok - nothing wrong with it, but I tasted it too, and I thought it was bland for minestrone. Maybe this is simply a style thing, but it might have been a lack of care.

My daughter had spaghetti bolognaise for mains, while I had the chef's recommendation seafood sauce (crab based) with linguine. The bolognaise was very good. The key to the sauce is to use quality meat, and this was well evident. The spaghetti was ""al dente"". You couldn't ask for better.

My crab based sauce was delicate, with balanced flavour. Unfortunately, the linguine was overcooked enough to spoil the effect, i.e. slightly gluggy, making it a forgettable meal. There's no magic to cooking pasta properly, you need only be able to tell the time. For a specialist pasta restaurant, I would like to think they can do this every time.

We had a bottle of Italian wine that was reasonable quaffing quality, albeit at Singapore prices. The service was really good. Not over-bearing, but available and good natured. Overall though, I can't say that I wasn't a bit disappointed. These are not difficult meals to make. With a bill that came in at around $SG170 for 2 (i.e. hardly cheap-and-cheerful prices), the chef's recommendation should be close to perfect.

I'd go back, but I'd stick to basic spaghetti."
Very good taste and service,I went to the restaurant with friends last holiday and was impressed by the Intalian Pasta with special taste. Especially I have talked with Shamim- manager who is very friendly and recommended us some best food which make us satisfied. We surely come back again one day in near future.
Nice italian food,This is the place to go for good Italian food and good ambience by the Singapore River. Service from staff is good but can be improved. Good chefs. I will go again when I visit.
"Food is good, service can be better","I've been to this place a couple of times and love the food. The only small complain I have is that every time my special requests for seats are never taken note of. Basically no difference if you make reservations or not, as they will just pop you to any seats which is convenient for them. Hopefully this can improve next time."
Nice Place,"Have a good evening with nice foods by riverside view & good service.. Vince, thanks for your good & friendly services.."
Bravo - Pasata Fresca Da Salvatore,Nice niew with nice food. Definitely a must go place in any day. Thanks you Vince for the good services and recommendations on food.
Good restaurant in a nice setting,I enjoyed my dinner here after a day walking and discovering the city. The scenery around the restaurant is one of the best in Singapore. Aimed at tourists and people working in the surrounding buildings.
Good food!,Probably one of the best pastas I've had in a long time. We were seated in the area during the day time but I believe in the evening the outdoor seating will also be ideal.
Tasty pasta!,"Came here during lunch and the pasta has been consistently good! I had the seafood pasta with tomato based sauce and fettuccini, paired well with peroni and some calamari sides"
best Pasta and pizza along Boat Quay,Is a rainy noon weekday but this doesn't chase the crowd away. The home made pasta blown me away. Chef cook with love - i have found it in town.
Excellent service!!!,All food is great in the menu. Staffs are sincere and excellent service!! Especially branch manager Mr Shamim!! Keep up the good work!!
Look no further for fine authentic Italian cuisine with the best service you will ever find in Singapore.,"Pasta Feesca has been a favourite dining spot for me since I was a kid. Dad would bring me there for meals on special occasions and I will always recall the one on one moments with him. Now that I have a family of my own, it still remains as our restaurant of choice. Kids love it. Food is fantastic. Service is excellent. Pastas are always cooked spot on. Over the years my family has become friends with the owner and his excellent team, in particular Restaurant Manager Shamim. He goes beyond his duty to make guests feel welcomed and comfortable. So if you are looking for a place for rich Italian flavours, and a good time, look no further."
Good food at reasonable price,"Food was delivered at reasonable timing. Portion was just nice and tasted good. Tiramisu dessert was not as good as expected though. Feels like i am eating just a normal sponge cake. As an Italian restaurant, i have expected a better tasting tiramisu."
Satisfactory dining experience,"First time dining here; the pasta was good and tasted fresh. Waiter was ready with recommendations for pasta pairing for my chosen sauce base. It was not very crowded whilst we were there, so we were allowed to choose our own seats by the riverside and service was very prompt and attentive.

Staff were friendly and although there was some delay with bill payment at the end of the meal (due to some e-voucher redemption issues which 1) I guess they are not used to and 2) most guests will not be utilising anyway - fair enough), they were very nice about it and even gave us a complimentary dessert as way of apology. We were happy about the way everything was handled."
"Good food, great service",Had an awesome time with friends. Nice ambience and good food with great service to boot. Special mention to Jenny & Shamim for making our evening wonderful!
Nice staff and amazing food,"This is not the first time i visit this restaurant but i always love to be here. Staffs are very nice and food is amazing. If you really want to taste the real Italian pasta, just come here, a very special authentic taste."
"Wonderful Food, Excellent Service",Attentive service and tasty food. Enjoyed the breeze by the river. Love the Cannelloni Pasta. Would be back with more friends!
"Bad pasta, worse service.","The very basic bolognese pasta was watery, feel like eating a frozen food for 20 bucks? This is your place. Service was worse, the malaysian looking waiter did not clean our appetiser plates before bringing in our main course, he just put the plate on the side of the table without getting our used plate... we had to call him to get our plate and not even with a nice attitude the indian dude was the only waiter who was nice."
"Home made pasta, food is amazing, should visit","I came here with few of my friends from my hometown, they also have 2 childrens. We all enjoyed our food a lot from pizza to pasta. The pasta as i was advised in freshly home made hence i feel it tatse so unique. The staffs are very helpful and friendly. I will definitely introduce to my other friends if they visit Singapore"
Looks can fool you,"The pizzas looked amazing but unfortunately they were not. It was like eating cardboard. I got a pizza and my boyfriend got a calzone and he said the same. The menu wasn't up to date drinks on it that they didn't even sell. Advised all cocktails 12.90 (12 something anyways), there was 3 on menu. Worst meal all holiday, tasteless."
Mixed experience,"Whilst the setting is lovely, and we sat on the river bank, this is not a restaurant we would re-visit. The waiting staff were unhelpful with food choices and seemed impatient when taking the order. The main course arrived and the starter plates were still on the table.
The starters were good with large portions; the Parma ham wrapped around bread sticks were excellent. However, the main courses were not so good - the lasagne was more pasta than meat, and the spaghetti was over cooked and the sauce too thick.
The overall price seemed expensive for the food quality we had."
Real Italian food,"After have been living for some years in Malaysia it's really a happy day when you find authentic Italian food in Asia. Natural taste and not mixed with chilli or anything else like Sambal the penne arrabiata were delicious. The cannelloni were nice but very mild. Pizza very natural, what I appreciate. No artificial herbs...come and try Italian authenticity."
Good food but other aspects need to be improved,"This restaurant came highly recommended but it was disappointing. Pasta was good. The starters of cannelloni with spinach and prosciutto with mozzarella were delicious. Whilst the service was polite, overall it was unprofessional. When we asked the waiter to take our order, it was met with a terse officious reply e.g. I will come back to you but he never did. And we called another waiter. Whilst I can appreciate camaraderie amongst staff, the waiters’ behaviours were unprofessional as they spoke in their own language referring to guests and simply left the menu on the table clumsily. The service team needed closer supervision. The place was tired looking with tattered menu. Not going back to this joint for sure."
A totally satisfied customer !,The pasta at this place is amazing. The staff is super friendly and the prices are totally fine. You can sit outside at the river where you have an absolutely stunning view. We had an amazing Dinner there!
Ambience + Food = Excellent!,Fining dinning concept. Very expensive though but the set dinner is just nice to fill the stomach. Not too much!
another fav,"I love the ambience at Boat Quay and at this restaurant I especially enjoy san giovanrese pasta. Sitting on the river's edge sipping wine, watching the ferries go by, the lights of the colonial parts of Singapore come on at dusk. I have been to this restuarant of the past 18 months and the quality is consistent."
