Family lunch,"Planning for a family lunch and chanced upon Vatos while scrolling through Facebook. Praveen assisted with our reservations. Received a warm welcome upon our arrival. As it was our first visit, decided to trust Praveen on his recommendations. We were served up the cowboy queso, cheeseburger spring roll, kimchi pork quesadillas, chimichurri prawn tacos and galbi short ribs tacos. Our favourites were the Cheeseburger spring roll and the galbi short ribs tacos. They currently only have one dessert on the menu, looking forward to them adding more items on the dessert menu. Highly recommend for anyone looking to have a casual lunch or dinner with friends and family. Service is warm and friendly. Kudos to Praveen for extending top notch service throughout our lunch."
gloppy fake cheese,"Mexican restaurants in SG in general are not the best but this place is truly awful. The nachos were a huge glop of soggy chips and fake cheese. Like the cheapest cheese sauce from a fast-food restaurant. I ate a few bites and was horrified that it cost >$30. The meat was yesterday's cold pork. A huge dissappointment all around. Anybody know of a good Tex-Mex place, in SG, let me know!"
Lovely,"Great cocktails. Ordered galbi beef tacos and fries. Fries were perfect galbi beef was tender. Although I would have preferred the taco to be more spicy, even after asking for extra hotsauce it still had no kick. Please stock up on some nuclear options. Service was 5/5"
Mixed feelings,"I’ve been to Vatos quite a number of times. I booked through Chope app. When I reached there. They told me that I didn’t confirmed my reservations, since they couldn’t get me when They called me to confirm the day before. I was very surprised as I checked my call logs, there were no calls from them at all. I even showed them. But they insisted they called me. .. anyway, I ended up with an outside table because I guess they weren't able to “confirm” my booking with me. It was pretty humid as I preferred indoor tables. Food was okay as usual."
Disappointing,"For a restaurant with the word Tacos in it, its tacos were sadly disappointing. My friend and I ordered the baja fish tacos and the prawn tacos. I was really looking forward to having fish tacos after having had pretty decent ones at 2 other Mexican places in Singapore. The fish was not seasoned and pretty tasteless; there was not much of a taco sauce either to lift the flavour of the dish which had some shredded vegetables on it aside from the battered fish and corn tortillas. When I asked for more sauce, they gave me the same dipping sauce they used for the cheeseburger spring rolls which we had also ordered - what tasted essentially like a sriracha mayo sauce. I didn't taste the prawn tacos but my friend who had tasted the fish did say that the prawn was slightly better seasoned than the fish, although still very disappointing. The cheeseburger spring rolls were tasty but very very oily (probably due to the poor frying method).

I gave this review 2 stars only because (i) they did give us a free serving of crispy nachos or tortillas (sorry, I am not sure what they were exactly - they were large and round) with a couple of dipping sauces when we sat at the table which was a nice touch; (ii) the staff were relatively friendly and (ii) the place had a nice ambience with its lighting.

I really wish I'd had a better taco experience here as this place has potential if they could improve their seasoning/spring roll frying techniques."
Saturday chillax,"I think this place is good for gathering. The Tacos are nice albeit portion a bit small. I would suggest instead of ordering everything at once, order one or two at once as the food taste much better when it’s hot."
"Great food, average ambience and service","Great tasting variety of Korean-Mexican fusion, quality of food is definitely there.

Ambience indoors is cramped and ventilation is bad, outdoors is really subject to Singapore's warm and humid weather, it gets uncomfortable after a while. Great for peeps who spent their lives in wintery conditions but bad for peeps from the tropics.

Service was pretty average, reserved a table and expected to get a seat indoors but somehow this was given to a walk-in before me. I don't see the point of reserving if it does not get me a better seat. Of course, you run the risk of no available tables as a walk-in but this particular point puzzles me."
Good place for mexican food,"food is not bad , good alternate to the popular spots. indoors could be a little brighter as it got quite dark by night and reading the menu was a challenge."
Bit disappointed (sorry),"Had eaten there years back was nice, but last night music inside was way too loud, table was wobbly, service was chaotic, starters and mains served same time, food
tasted bland, and margaritas lacked punch (was just like a 7-11 slurpy). This combination left us disappointed, though were kind enough to move us to outside table at our request."
Good experience,"Very enjoyable, the Galbi short rib tacos were very tasty, the baja tacos were alright. Seasoned fries were very crispy and tasty, bit on the salty side though.
Service was prompt,
Overall would reccomend.

But tacos were kinda small though. Also please add less salt to the fries."
Consistent food quality,I love the flavourful and fresh tacos Vatos has on the menu. The fusion taste to the ingredients used is everything! ◡̈
Loved it!!,Food and Service - Excellent! Table was a bit high for a family member using a wheelchair. Some traditional Latin American music would be nice instead of the reggaeton.Lots of energy! Loved the Taco Tuesday deals. The one and only dessert was fab!
Interesting food menu,"Ordered 2 tacos - shredded pork taco & the fried prawns. Both were so yummy & delicious!! Also highly recommend the burger spring roll. Unique, crispy and taste really good! Our 1st visit there and definitely will be back for more!"
Poor service attitude and worn out stools,"I'm all disappointed and embarrassed about your service attitude. I had to apologize for making a mistake about my booking of 5 to 6pax right after restrictions were allowed up to 10. You said you could reject my booking anytime but you failed to appreciate the fact that we took many months to plan this meet-up. Selfishly, you lied about a full house booking, because we sat thru your last order. You have rejected us more than 3x asking nicely if we could have just a smaller side table to place our food as the table was suited for 4pax. We also had to keep going back into your restaurant to order our food, drinks, get napkins as your drinks didn't come with a coaster and were dripping wet all over and you saw it without providing a remedy. You truly lacked the basic service and attitude I would expect. In the end, I had to agree with my friend that this is not a restaurant but we were given and paying for to be seated in a ""hawker center"". But hey... my hawker uncles and aunties treated me much better you know. I hardly had a one star review, but after much thoughts... I think you deserved this as you've treated your returned customer like the floor mat without qualms and left us out in the cold. If there were any mistakes on our part, is that we chose the wrong venue to meet, got excited and overlooked the fact that an added person or seat would change the way we were treated as paying customers. Moving on with aplenty options out there since we weren't welcomed here."
Overrated,"Average food, poor atmosphere, horrible seats and just extremely unpleasant staff. Go to Super Loco instead!"
Great Place & Nice Food,"Nice place to chill and their The ""SID"" burger is a must try!! Frozen Margaritas was also great too."
"May visit again, but without pets.","Service:
It's a pet friendly restaurant, but was left outside (totally alone) on a solo table as we have pets with us. We understand as pets are not allowed in the restaurant, but there was NO follow ups, or topping up of water after our orders were served. Totally no servers came out to ask us how the food were, or at least to check on us. We felt super outcast. Been to many pet friendly restaurants and always seated outdoors, but this is the only one that made us felt this way. We felt forgotten to be honest. When I made payment, I have to walk into the restaurant to ask for the bill, and the staff was like : ""Oh! The table outside! "" -.-""

Food:
It was alright, but price seems to have increased as the advertised price by food blogger states otherwise.

The interior of the restaurant looks good, but unfortunately we were left at the outside of the corridor with ppl keep walking past us thus it's a pretty awarkward lunch for us. Thus I may have a diiferent view if Im seated inside."
Our Fav!,"Great food, great beer, great service! Every time we come the service is fantastic and the food is top quality. I ca never choose my favourite dish."
Great Experience,"First time here, settled down sitting at the bar counter after few shifting.
We had the fish, beef tacos & chicken nachos, the serving size for nachos was generous.
The frozen strawberry margarita is good, big glass serving too.
Consider pricy but bought the 50% Chope voucher, overall great experience, will come back again when 50% voucher still available."
TACO FIXING SPOT,"Whenever I’ve got a crave for Tacos, this is the place I must have it fixed!◡̈ So glad to introduce this place to my foodie friend this time round!"
"dark room, food court environment, food ok","Went there for lunch catch up. Service was good, food was ok, environment & atmosphere below expectation. Room was very dark for lunch time and open kitchen wasn't clean & tidy thus make not great impression."
Bad food and poor service,"We were seated in the outside area of the restaurant. The service was very slow, as they were quite understaffed. Good was a big disappointment. Guac was not flavourful. I ordered mushroom spinach tamales, but the taste was awful. Pork tacos were also really bad. Only saving grace were the drinks. Overall a very lousy dinner experience"
Poor service but decent food!,"Second time here, food is still good as I remembered. However, service was disappointing this time. Waitress spoke with little empathy and logic - “you can only use coupons bought before you step into the restaurant” (???) and told us to lower our volume just because we were the only ones talking in the restaurant. Doesn’t make sense and dining experience felt restrictive from then on."
Really delicious mexican foods,Food was amazing. Had the fish tacos & nachos. Serving size was generous and service was quick! The frozen margarita is not too strong too you must try!!
Wonderful experience,Cool place to go for Mexican food. Service is great & atmosphere is suitable for couples & groups. Food is wonderful. Was given a complimentary starter. I didn’t purchase any vouchers so the tacos I ordered came in 3s instead of 2s.
Grumpy Staff,"I don’t know what rule during covid says we can’t chat and laugh while enjoying dinner with friends.

We were told off by the staff with the tattoo sleeves to keep it down. The table next to us was being particular loud and laughing at times, I saw him look at them but they were not told off like we were.

Ruined what was a rather pleasant evening.

I understand restaurants are under pressure but I don’t see why we are not able to laugh and chat with friends. A bit archaic don’t you think?"
Great food,"The food was great! We ordered the Shrimp Tacos, Kimchi Fries and Beef Quesadillas. The Shrimp Tacos were very delicious and full of flavour with super juicy shrimps! The Beef Quesadillas were decent but can get a bit cloying after awhile. The Kimchi Fries were great as well. The only complaint is that the staff arranged us to an outside seat even though we noticed that there were empty seats inside the restaurant and even after some customers left. Perhaps it's due to Covid-19 regulations? hehe but overall it was good! I would definitely visit again :)"
Ambience and quality of food and staff,"Was a really nice place to visit for a date and the ambience was good, food was superb, definitely worth every cent spent there! Staff were especially hospitable and friendly"
More of a pub and drinks place,"We went there for lunch and was disappointed that the restaurant was not linked to the rest of South Beach (this is more a property development issue we know), and had to use umbrellas to get to the restaurant. Didn't help that the interior was pretty dark, so probably better for a bar/ drinks place. The quality of food was not as good at the Holland Village outlet (which is also not sheltered from rain!). Will probably go back to the Holland Village on though as they have the weekend/ kids menu there, but not at the South Beach out."
Low on EQ for staff,We were obv enjoying ourselves and ordered the Makgeollitas which was 1 litre. 5mins after they told us our booking is only for 2 hrs so we need to wrap it up. They should have not let us ordered then if they knew our time was almost up! When settling the bill we were trying to figure out if we should use the burpple app but they were inpatient for us to walk us through the items bec they wanted us to leave ASAP. A shame bec some of them were nice but the 2 people was a stand out for poor customer service. Sigh.
Department Lunch,This was my 3rd visit in pass 6 mths. Vatos Urban always been best place to hang out with friends. The staffs are friendly and the food was excellent.
Good Ambiene with friendly staff,Food taste great. The food came to us quick fast after ordering . Friendly staff and good atmosphere
Underwhelming food and poor service,"Went back to Vatos, after more than a year. The food quality has really dropped and a rude member of the staff did not really help the experience. Used to be one of my favorite places to go, but not going back"
Terrible Service and rubbish food,the staff with the full sleeves was extremely rude throughout our time there. Blasted music way above the COVID-19 approved decibel levels with to massive speakers right beside out table. Food was pretty crappy as well.
Great food with Poor Service,"See title. Food was fantastic, beer selection (for craft beer lovers) we good, cool music playing. Pretty much all the key elements for a great dining experience. Service really poor, even though dining room less than half full. Staff more interested is playing on mobile phones or socialising together around the bar, than focussing on the few tables that had customers."
Mexican food with positive twist,"Mexican food with a twist. Place has garage ambience and music was playing in the background with volume that gave the feeling of party time. All food we ate with my family was good. Mexican bottled mango soda was a great bonus for the experience. Prices little high, but food was worth the price."
Services can be better,"Food is good but services from waiter needs much (x10000) improvement. They think they are doing you a favor by bringing food to your table.
1. Asked for a refill but nothing came back.
2. Nasty attitude from one waiter.
3. Asked for salsa and came back with hot sauce.
If you encounter this particular waiter, quickly asked for another waiter."
"Great food, nice ambience, friendly staff","We went for dinner and the place was not crowded yet. We were guided by the staff to do safe entry check ins, then directed to our table. As we sat down and ordered, i noticed the staff were very alert and prompt. They were also friendly while attending to us. Overall, a nice place to hang out and chat w your friends and loved ones."
Seats are uncomfortable and food not as good as past visit,The high stools were really uncomfortable to sit on for long. I've been to other places with high stools that are much more comfortable. Feet was numb after a while. There was also a miscom over the orders. We clearly recalled ordering only one of the tacos but the staff insisted she did confirm with us when she read out our orders. The steak for the fajitas was overcooked and dry. Tacos and fries were served quite fast but overall service wasn't that attentive as the place was busy and it was hard to get the attention of the staff.
Perfect mexican,"Literally the go to place for actual mexican in Singapore. Kinda sad the tacquitos were gone, but oh well. The waitress who kept pouring water all night was cute too oops ;)"
Good quesadillas / Rest average,"As per title the quesadillas were good, very good actually.

The rest we found average, including the tacos which did not have much taste despite looking good. The chicken wings we had we could not really taste the chicken under the heavy coating and sauce which were overpowering.

Service was ok. Atmosphere was kind of festive and nice. Overall if you like your chicken quesadillas with lots of cheese visit for that."
"Worst food and service, the experience was on of the worst we have had ever. Do not recommend","Worst food and service, the experience was on of the worst we have had ever. Do not recommend this at all to anyone"
"Great experience, much better than the previous time","Food was served hot, unlike the previous time where it was cold. Loved the Quesadillas, cheese was gooey and went well with the kimchi pork filling. Was seated indoors this time as we made a reservation. Service was good, staff were attentive."
"Food is good, Drinks are tad expensive, Wait Staff are slow","Interesting mix between korean and mexican. We liked the food.. but drinks were priced a bit on the high side - So make sure u go during happy hour before 7pm!

Service was slow and a tad messy (im guessing its cuz its a friday night). Our happy hour food and drinks were billed full price - so good thing we double checked the bill.

Other than that it's a nice place to chill after work!"
Tacos doesn’t taste like tacos at all,"Expected tacos to at least taste like a little like tacos since it’s Korean Mexican inspired. Tried the Fish Taco and Short Rib Galbi Taco and the Fish was crispy and the Galbi tastes good. But overall it does not taste like a taco at all, just tortilla shell with meat and some vegetable on top. Sauce on taco was barely noticeable. Also got the kimchi fries which i think was good and a great choice to try. Frozen margarita not recommended, just tastes like a normal slushy. Sat outdoor and honestly the ambience and vibe was good but sadly I won’t be back."
Ethics gone missing?,"I am doing part-time delivery during this COVID-19 period and had a delivery from this restaurant. When I arrived at 1245pm (15 minutes past pick up time), I was informed that the food is not ready. They could not give me a time and just kept telling me they are preparing the food. No apology was extended and I was asked to sit in the restaurant and wait for the food.

Due to the the lateness expected, I proceeded to inform the customer about the status of the food. To my surprise, when the customer called to ask why the food is so late, the restaurant actually informed her I am still on the way to pick up the food, while all the time I was sitting in the restaurant and the call was answered right in front of me.

I have no comments about the food but I assume it must have been of respectable standards going by the crowd. However, if a restaurant cannot be honest to it's customers, and need to resort to even lying, then I wonder how honest it's food can be. By the time I picked the food, it was 1320, 50 minutes past what the pick-up time was supposed to be. I was honestly inclined to try the restaurant in the near future, but no thanks."
Pretty Pleasant,"I had a rather pleasant experience at Vatos Urban Tacos. Was being seated outside, not that I minded because the weather was good that day but personally feel like the place could've been brighter? Maybe a lamp on the table would've been great. Could't really see what I was eating because of the darkness. Overall experience was still pleasant"
Chope Voucher was rejected,"I sat and asked whether I can use Chope Voucher. Was told that I can not use the voucher if I have not purchase the voucher. I can only use the voucher if i purchase the voucher 1 day before. I asked where is the terms & conditions that says that, the answer was it is T&C between Chope & them. I have been a platinum member of Chope for years, and this is the first time I am hearing such thing. So I decided to walk out and not having lunch there. I spent $200 lunch somewhere near the area."
Love this place!,It's my second time coming here and it was for my mother's birthday (she loves tacos) and she really enjoyed herself! Food was great.
One of the best Mexican food in town,"One of the best Mexican food in town. Served authentic Mexican food and you enjoyed the real vibe here. Tacos with prawn , short ribs and pull pork was really good. The beef fajitas, tequila chicken wing, nachos with belly pork must eat! The peach and passion fruit margarita was excellent but less alcohols to make you feel “good”. However, the table is rather small for 5 of us with drinks and foods comes at one time! So please do order slowly and order again if you want to eat more..! Else the service is fantastic and nice ambience !"
A Great Mexican Fix,"Delicious and relatively affordable Tacos! We ordered the Pulled Pork, Fish & Shrimp Tacos and loved all of them. Alcoholic drinks were served in huge glasses (not that I'm complaining). The only negative comment from me is the service of their staff - received a call from a staff to tell me that my reservation time was not amended (I changed from 7pm to 8pm) and had an earful from her to say how I should have asked for the name of the staff who took my call 2 days ago. Additionally, when we were at the restaurant, they seemed quite short-handed and took a while for us to get the staff's attention."
Delicious Honey Tequila wings,"Delicious Honey Tequila wings and good cocktails! It’s a bit loud and the staff were hard to get hold off because they were so busy. But the food and drinks were good, and we had a fun time with friends."
It's okay.,"Honestly I've heard so many good things about this place, but the food was probably a 6/10. I've found other mexican places more flavorful. I do think certain sauces were great and their tamales was super, but tacos-wise it was honestly just ok, not enough sauce, a bit bland.

Service was fine, drinks was great. A bit more of a casual place than I expected."
Amazing experience!,"My family and I went to Vatos for dinner and absolutely loved it! The food was amazing, the staff were friendly and service was really quick. Absolutely loved it and will go back again"
"Poor service, you deserve better","We were a group of three and we came 5 minutes early before our reservation time at 8:15PM.

We were told to wait, and wait, and WAIT, and we were then told our seats are bar seats. Mind you, we are a group of 3, and it is not the most conducive seating environment for a group of 3.

While we were still waiting, we noticed there was an empty small high table, which was meant for 2, but there were 3 seats there, and we agreed we were okay to squeeze a little.

At 8:30PM (i will do the math for you, this was 15 minutes past our reservation time, let me repeat, 15 MINUTES WHEN WE HAD A RESERVATION), we finally managed to catch a staff's attention and suggested we squeeze a little and take the small high table meant for 2. The staff mentioned that table was reserved for a couple who arrived later than us and they were quickly ushered to their seats while us, the 8:15PM reservation timing, were still standing at the cashier because apparently our table was taking more than 15 minutes to clean.

Firstly, isn't it more logical for a 2 pax party to take the bar seats instead of a 3 pax party? Have you tried talking to each other in a linear fashion while seating beside each other ear to ear? Have you been at the sides, reaching over the middle person just to get the shared food you ordered? Have you been the middle person having to repeat your conversations twice, awkwardly turning your heads to give both your friends equal attention?

Secondly, we had a reservation. It wasn't as if we were walk-in customers. Do you really need 15 minutes to clean the table? Honestly, you took more than 15 minutes. When you showed us to our table, you were still cleaning the table, and we were just standing there, watching...Make it 20 minutes of cleaning now.

The reason why I give 2 stars is because food is served pretty quickly, the taste is mediocre, in essence, food is edible. But do you really want to put yourself through such an emotional and taxing ordeal? If you feel, for some reason, you need your day to be ruined, just make a reservation and see yourself served to your seat late, and witnessing your bar seats (hopefully not) still being cleaned.

Save yourself the stress, there are better mexican places."
good atmosphere,the service there is good. friendly staff. good food. except the ventilation can be improved. our clothes smell of food after 😅
not bad korean-mexican fusion,"food here is interesting korean-mexican fusion and is seriously not bad, though i think we over-ordered for 2:
- kimchi fries
- mushroom quesa
- 2 galbi tacos
- enchiladas
and drinks

what was not too enjoyable though was the service provided by a few of the younger service staff, who were nonchalant at best; they had made and served me a totally wrong cocktail, and the thing about cocktails is that you are none the wiser until you take that first sip. the staff did not offer to change it for me, nor apologize for the mistake. saving grace was the much better service provided by the older service staff, and that weekend was a much needed staycation break away from work."
Delicious!,Had dinner with my fiance and we had a really great time there! The food was excellent especially the cheeseburger spring roll was my ultimate favourite. Great ambience. Their Frozen Mango Margarita is really good!!
Great experience,Great food and drinks selection. One of the best tacos I've had in a very long time. A bit pricey but worth it.
Delicious Food and Very good Service!!,"Went there with friends on Friday night. Restaurant is full, lucky we manage to grab a table even for an hour but still worth it, as the service is fast, we had Galbi Tacos, Kimchi Fries and prawn tacos all , nachos mama, spring rolls and wings was delicious,staff are knowledgable with the food and drinks. the ambience was great and the staff were nice and helpful.

Definitely recommended and a 5 stars well deserved"
Holland village branch rubbish service,"We had yummy tacos and a so so burrito bowl with slightly watery margaritas. However the most disappointing aspect of the experience was the slow, unfriendly, ungracious service. It verged on hostile. Overpriced and miserable"
Service kind of took a bite out of the 5 stars,"The vibes at the restaurant was good, with very yummy food and to be honest, the food was served pretty fast as well.

But the service leaves much to be desired as it it was understaffed, servers was less than enthusiastic, and none of them really make you feel welcome even as I was on my best behaviour. Pity actually."
Spectacular!,"Wow, I had no idea there were such good tacos in Singapore! We had a couple of each and they were ALL good. The Mexican Martini was the absolute show-stealer though! Perfect in every way, we ca,e back three times just to have this drink, and their amazing chips and salsa!"
Wasn’t what i expected.,"The place looks amazing! & i have this habit of checking the menu out before going to the place. So i thought, it was excellent. Menu looks good & the interior was amazing!

However, i was put off by the staff who greeted us. She was hostile & not welcoming at all. To be fair, she was settling her cashier but nonetheless, a little but of warm welcome & a smile doesn’t hurt.

Followed by the ordering, it was really hard to capture the staffs attention & they didn’t check on us even once. We ordered 8 pairs of tacos & some wings to start. However after we finished the tacos, the wings have yet to arrive. When we checked w them, their response was as casual as “wings have waiting time”. I was in disbelief. Of course every food/drinks there is a waiting time to it. What would be nice is to inform beforehand regarding the waiting time for the wings to not kill the expectation of the starter being the last dish served.

Moving on the the food, the taco was disappointing. The soft shell was rather “vulnerable”. I couldn’t pick up the taco without tearing the shell. And on top of that, the ratio of the veg & garnish to the main star itself is like 2:1 To those who are not fussy, you’ll probably be alright with the food. But as for me, I couldn’t enjoy the food at all.

Lucky for us, the drinks we ordered meet our expectation. We had ‘Gold Digger’ which is an apple margarita served with somersby apple bottle. It was amazing. The price is pretty steep like $30 but its ok. As long as it taste good.

All in all, the food was beyond our control as we were experimenting. But the service could definitely be improved. Be more attentive to your surroundings & once again, doesn’t hurt to smile."
Tasteless burritos and not inexpensive,Tried the steak Burrito. You get a lot of ingredients for your $17 but this is a case of too much. Everything is tossed together without any thought about how they blend. Very disappointing and service was not especially fast although the place was pretty busy.
Nothing outstanding,Vatos is a Mexican place with a hint of Asian. I don’t think it’s fusion food. It’s got a rustic ambience. The bar stool type seating is not particularly comfortable. The food is ok. The beef tacos were bad but chicken was good. The chicken fajita platter was nice. It’s quite expensive for what it offers.
Love the food and drinks,"Food was done well, drinks were interesting and decor was nice. It had a good atmosphere for gatherings."
vegetarian dishes quite good and drinks awesome,"I went 2 times, baja fish is quite tasty, so does all the vegetarian dishes. Drinks are awesome and very authentic."
great hidden place in town,"great korean n us inspired cocktails , atmosphere and great fusion Mexican n korea food. love the casual atmosphere and the service . would come again"
Great food and all but please fix dripping aircon!,"food, drinks and staff were amazing. one thing not so amazing was the water from the air con dripping all over our food/drinks."
Good ambience but food too salty,"Place is meant to be a drinking hole, so I guess the food is ridiculously salty. Won't recommend if you are there for their food without drinking beer. Service and ambience was not bad."
Good Mexican Food!,"Tasty mexican food, nice vibe & ambiance, average service, but quite pricey especially the alcoholic drinks."
Good food. Slow service.,"Food was good. Had the fish and chicken tacos and chicken wings.
However, did not expect the tacos to be served soft. It was difficult to share and turned soggy pretty quick. Service was slow, not enough service crew for a Friday night since it was pretty packed."
Authentic Mexican food! Savoury and Delicious dishes in a good atmosphere!,Authentic Mexican food! Savoury and Delicious dishes in a good atmosphere! I love how the prawns was cooked to perfection for the tacos.
Great place to stop after work,"Very good soft tacos and great service, but definitely not a family place. Fun vibe for a office workers stopping to get a bite after work"
Nacholicious!,"Good selection of Mexican food and fun cocktails. The fish tacos and burger I wish weren’t mattered. Although nice tasting, I think simply fried or grilled better. I’m not a fan of batter. It’s my third time at Vatos and I’ll definitely be back."
Generous Portions,"Nice Tex-Mex food with very generous portions. In the end, needed to pack quite a bit of food home. Overall good value for money."
Great lunch spot,"Great lunch. Had the jalapeño spring rolls and spicy chicken street tacos. Good size portions. Plenty of space. Service was friendly and attentive. Let me have ""taste"" have a couple of the draft micro-brews to tell which one I wanted to order. Definitely will go back"
Sunday Lunch,"We visited on the Sunday of the Grand Prix. Service was friendly, the menu was varied and the beer was 2 for 1. We ate quite lightly but enjoyed what we had - nachos, fish tacos and a chicken special. Wasn’t keen on the stools as seats though. A bit uncomfortable after half an hour."
Great food & drinks to unwind,"Though a bit noisy for a date, bring friends and colleagues along to unwind with great food and drinks."
Mexi-Ko fusion,"Good selection of the traditional and Korean fusion Mexican. The very accommodating and friendly staff will make you feel welcome, there is a kids menu available if you happen to have a fussy eater. A decent selection of American and Australian beers which compliment the menu and of course generous sized margaritas.
Their playlist is also pretty good if you are in your late 30s and into R&B."
Interesting mix of Korean and Texmex,Walking distance from Promenade MRT but the location is tricky to find. It's one of the colonial building facing Raffle's Hotel. I was so glad i made reservation via Chope cause the place was fully booked. Very casual atmosphere serving Texmex with Korean vibes. The portion is quite big so good for sharing. Loved the tequila infused chicken wing and sizzling cheese dip (wish they served more chips with the dip).
Food was good but overall experience was less than exceptional,"I made a booking through Chope and the table was ready for us in good time. It was Tacos Tuesday when we could order three tacos for the price of two.

At the same time, I was buying some Chope vouchers thinking that I could use them to pay part of the bill.

It was not made clear to me till later that I would not be allowed to use the vouchers to pay for the tacos promotion.

I was feeling a little cheated.

The food was tasty though the drinks were pricey.

The hard circular stools that we sat on made us felt uncomfortable after a while."
AWESOME PLACE TO CHILL,"Brought many of my friends there and never once did it fail us. Really love the tacos and the frozen margaritas. maybe the free chips can make it refillable or at least enough for the table (2 persons 1 basket, 3 persons 1 basket, 4 persons also 1 basket.. abit not enough to go around :P - but at least it is free)"
Tacos with a Korean twist,Great place for lunch for large groups . Delicious tacos - we had a variety of them - especially liked the Korean chicken and pork ones. Very good food - will visit again
Treat,Food and drinks were good. Service was also good. A few more vegetarian choices would gave been great. High table was good but not too comfortablr to sit in.
Dinner with fam,"Good food , great ambience , friendly staff , quick service , pocket friendly , they have some great cocktails!! The place is so lively all the time!"
Overall great food at a casual setting,"Ordered their tacos, carnitas taquitos and tamales. Food was delicious and had beer to go with it and it was a good dinner. This place would be great for a group of friends looking for a place for food and drinks."
Great Street Tacos in Singapore,Was looking for a light lunch near the Carlton Hotel and found this gem on Beach St. I had the Chimichurri chicken tacos. They were very good. Had the 3 taco plate. Was a generous size street taco. Perfect blend of spice/pepper and sweet/savory chicken. Had it with a Jarritos mandarin soda. $S22.
Amazing tacos and atmosphere !,My husband's first time here and he is a Mexican food fanatic. He ordered and loved the Korean poboy burrito and the huge margarita. Exactly what we needed on a Wednesday evening. See you soon!
Disappointing,Visited for lunch today for my last meal in Singapore. The guacamole was off and certainly not freshly made. Tacos and cocktail were nice. Not having fresh guacamole spoilt the whole experience for me. I ate at 2 nearby Mexican establishments during my 4 day stay and loved their food! Would not return!
Tacos all the way,"Went on a business trip with a collage . The place is nice and the interior designer did a good job to give the place a warm and casual atmosphere, although the bath rooms are outside the restaurant and shared with other restaurants.
We started with Guacamole that was too small to share between us two and hit a B- rating from the get go.
Next we went after the Tacos. Living in Southern California I can appreciate quality tacos and those were made to perfection.
The longhorn burger was disappointing and rated C , too oily and mushy due to the onion rings that did not do this burger any favors.
Beer was cold and nice, service was fast and friendly.
The bill was on little higher side but worth it.
Two Thumbs up on the Ofer scale."
Lovely tacos but below average service,"It's my second time at Vatos, and I really enjoyed the tacos, fries and drinks there. I went there on a weekday evening both times, but received below average service with unclear instructions on their F&B promotions. Staff in charge of payments gave a could not be bothered attitude when we tried to clarify, and basically wanted us to pay the bill and leave.

Based on the service I've received on both occasions i was there, I am not impressed with this restaurant."
overhyped,we had to wait ages to get a seat and the place was very crowded. prices are affordable only with the burrple beyond one-for-one. pork belly tacos was bad.
Great Place,"This place is great, food is amazing drinks are even better and in general, great ambiance. 10/10 will recommend."
"Mexican-Korean fusion, woop!","Absolutely loved the korean pork belly nachos and tacos, margaritas were awesome, would definitely be back again!"
Leaving lunch,I came back here with some colleagues recently for a leaving lunch for one of us who was heading back to Europe. Food here is acceptable enough but there is a very strong smell of cooking. Beers are decent though and service was efficient. Generally I think there are better options for Mexican food around.
Perfect Fusion of East and West,"After meeting Sid Kim, the proprietor of Vatos Urban Tacos - he is a Cal grad and was attending a screening of the Big Game with Stanford at Boomarang last November - I always meant to try this place. I was intrigued by the menu and the idea behind this restaurant - Korean + Mexican + proper attention to the joys of alcohol. This mix could work. I dealt with Korean companies for 30 years until I finally went to work for a chaebol in 2004. My taste buds became attuned to kalbi, bulgogi and kim chi while my liver was ravaged by soju, maguli and Johnny Walker in every possible color. The promos on Facebook for Vatos looked inviting. My daughter is vegeterian and my wife stopped drinking 4 years ago; hence, I could not manager to muster up a group. But this Father's Day my daughter booked a table for a Sunday brunch.
Sid Kim has created a magical blend of Korea and Mexico and spawned an eatery that deserves the highest ratings. I hesitate to praise this place too lavishly as I still want to be able to get a table there. And this is coming from a 3rd generation Stanford grad who habitually disses anything that has traversed through Sather Gate on the wrong side of the Bay. 5-stars for a place that is cozy, a little crowded, very kid-friendly but not luxurious. SInce arriving in Singapore in 1984, so-called Mexican cuisine here has fallen way short of even the lowest standards for native Angelenos. The taco trucks in Pasadena served better fare. Guacamole does not come out of a can. Salsa does not come out of a jar. Tortillas don't come out of a bag. Local Singaporeans can whip up popiah and dumplings to die for, but they never seemed to master tacos and burritos. But Sid Kim broke the mold. I dare say he has re-invented a cuisine that deserves its own ethnic designation. It adds a new dimension to casual dining. He has synthesiezed the best of both Mexico and Korea.
The Koreans really standout when it comes to meat, kim-chi and alcohol. Let's start with the bar. I resisted the temptation to try the soju-oriented cocktails and unique margaritas. Ice cold beer always goes best with spicy hot Korean barbeque. But I could not find Cass or OB on the menu. But the range of draft beers was very impressive ... quite a few pale ales, wheats, stouts ... PLUS it was 1 for 1 on a few brews. $13 got you two different pints ... where can you beat that?
Now to the food. The 3 Kalbi tacos were incredible. The Korean elements - the beef preparation, spices and lots of cabbage and vegetables (there was probably some kim-chee in there) really blended well ... The tacos were presentated nicely lined up on a lacquer plate and overstuffed with ingredients. The homemade tortillas were unlike any tortillas I have ever encountered. Not really flour or corn. Just a fresh tasty wrap that held all the stuffing in place. I did not have room for the kim chi fries which sounded good. I had to leave brefore opting for anothe 1 for 1 on the ales.
The ambience is just right ... dark, subdued, nice full bar. The tables are a bit close together in a family style kind of setup. It is very kid-friendly and fortunately, the kids were well-behaved.
This place was so outstanding that I may have to swallow my pride and traditions and start gate-crashing Cal Berkely alumni gatherings (they have a few of them at Vatos Urban Locos). Looking forward to the next visit. Hopefully Sid will be there and I will stand him a drink (at least the first round)."
Enjoyed the food!!,"The honey glazed chicken wings were great. Food a little spicy for kids but overall, it was great. A little brighter would be perfect."
Average but expensive tacos,"The moment you walk into the place, you’re hit with strong overpowering smell of onions which can be a little unpleasant.

The atmosphere is one of industrial but yet it is cosy. The tacos are pretty good but it’s not the best out there and they are pretty expensive, for the price you’ve to pay. You could get better tacos out there as well.

They do serve up some fancy and cool alcoholic drinks which girls would definitely love. I feel you can visit this restaurant if you’re not on a budget and don’t mind the price point."
