Disappointing!! Not worth it,"Went there on 25th Dec for lunch while wandering in the vicinity. Hoped to have a good meal but we were fairly disappointed.
Ordered hawaiian pizza, was not crisp infact was soggy. Eggs benedict were average, have had better at multiple places in the city. Fish and chips was good though fries along with it had too much oil. Lastly, the I found the pancakes (ordered from kids menu if I remember correctly) to be fairly dry. In a nutshell, wont visit the place again."
Lovely experience and ace service by Swati,"Le Noir has amazing drinks, music, and ambience, but for my family the attendant named Swati was the star. She really made us feel welcomed and comfortable. Very good cocktail knowledge and suggestions."
Swati,"Swati, such an amazing person and waitress. She is hospitable and accommodating! Truly loved her and the restaurant for"

Excellent place,The ambience and staff were just awesome..Good place to chill with friends. Will definitely be back ;)
Poor service for an establishment in MBS,"Was an impromptu visit to the establishment for a drink.

Music was nice and crowd were returning with the current measures. The down side started with just getting our orders, no server came to us after we were given the seat. Went to order at the bar and the bartender was rude and attitude of the servers were ""couldn't be bothered"". After a few hoops, manages to get our drinks.

Upon billing, we were given the wrong bill and the servers were like headless chicken going around with a bill in hand to find the right table.

Really poor service even if the band were great and the drinks can't go wrong."
Best live music venue in Singapore,This place never ceases to amaze . Fantastic live bands and great music and vibes coupled with spectacular views on the Marina Bay promenade.
Amazing after work drinks or appertivo before dinner!,"Impeccable service, awesome cocktails, delicious snack menu while watching the city skyline by the bay. Highly recommended and will come back again."
"No food, clueless staff and mangement","This place is a joke end-to-end. On visiting last night, a little late in the evening we were casually told they were still serving and we were welcome. On attempting to order we eventually found out at least six dishes were off the menu and only pizza was available or the quesadillas I had ordered. Surely impossible and clearly not true they just happened to run out all ingredients to a menu of dishes that are all largely the same. So some nachos turned up and 35 minutes later - no way past 10pm - I reminded them of my other dish which we were told had conveniently 'forgotten', and as compensation we were presented with four shots of cheap (unwanted) tequila! Sorry What?? To make matters worse while approaching 10.30 and therefore having to leave we were told we could not take away our remaining nachos as ""we don't have anything to wrap them in"" and they were promptly taken away. I asked quite rightly for my bill to be refunded in full for this lunacy. Manger strides over and lazily tells me he cannot do that as he has 'closed the till'. Can I speak to your manager I asked. ""I don't have a manager - I am the only manager"" He arrogantly told us we can have ""whatever we want to drink for free, and come back tomorrow."" Come this is unacceptable service, staff behaviour and management. Avoid it and don't give them the satisfaction just for having a good view, or like cheap tequila. Unbelievable."
Great atmosphere but miss the live bands,Despite clearly not being able to play music which Le noir is renowned for the atmosphere was still great and fantastic views . Of course there are restrictions and regulations imposed by the government but the staff did their best to make us feel comfortable. Great cocktails as always and good food . Look forward to when music returns .
Such a disappointment!,"Great View and location , lovely hostess but one of worth service I have experienced in Singapore. Rude waiters, not able to eat since they only had one cook on a Saturday night. 45 minutes to an hour of waiting and no food at the end ‚Ä¶. They tried to charge us full price even if it was Happy hours time.
Such a shame , the place has a nice vibe ."
Snacks,"Good for a sit-in and people watching while sipping that cocktail from the bar. Small portions served, so not an ideal place to ""ping"" your hunger."
They have the best cocktails,They have the best cocktails and at great prices . Added to an excellent food menu and the fantastic views this is a great place to chill in the evenings. Also they just added a kid‚Äôs menu so it‚Äôs great for families.
