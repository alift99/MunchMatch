"Super expensive prices, super small portions, average taste........","The 1st thing that shocked us were the very high end ""restaurant"" prices when we scanned through the menu. Considering this place is located in just a simple humble no frills HDB coffeeshop - with no expensive decor, no aircon , no expensive rentals.

The 2nd thing were the extremely small portions. We had 4 items for 3 pax, & the total portions would probably be just nice for one small eater. Imagine it cost $81 for this super expensive average taste meal, enough for just 1 small eater.

Yes, they gave 10% discount & no service charge ( not much service anyway) but it is still very expensive.

Food-wise is average. I had been on business trips in Spain for 10 years & loved Spanish food. Not bad here but not that great. And definitely not worth it too.

We were there between 6.30 - 8pm on a Saturday night. And there were only 3 tables of customers (about 2-3 pax each), including us.

Any wonder why?"
Fantastic food!,"We went on Thursday to Don Quijote for dinner. We were a party of 8 and we pre-ordered certain dishes we knew they need longer to cook (Paella for example and other meat dishes we wanted to try). I spent quite some time in Spain and I missed the food . So, I was pretty surprised to get such genuine, authentic taste ! This was by far the best Spanish restaurant I visited in Singapore since I moved here in 2014. My favorite dishes were the tapas : the bikini tapas, calamares fritos and callos (this one needs to be ordered in advance) , the meat dishes - especially charcoaled Angus Beef Rib, heavenly tender - and the Paella Negra - this dish to die for !!! Cava and Sangria accompanied and were the best !!! This place is highly recommended for everyone who genuinely appreciate authentic taste!"
Xmas meal from the best Spanish Restaurant,"A hidden gem in SG. Excellent food, efficient delivery service and great menu choices. Turkey were moist and delicious. Yummy paella and xmas ham. Best Spanish restaurant that serves quality food. Highly recommended and will definitely be back."
Tasty and passable Spanish food,"This Spanish eatery used to be in Dempsey, started operations in early August2020, here in a 7th Mile coffee shop, easy to find HDB parking spaces, we arrived without any reservation and sat opposite their stall, you order via QR code and can make payment straight away before food was served, food was quite tasty but the churros was a let down, food choices weren’t that interesting, however there is 10% discount and no 10% service charge, GST inclusive in prices."
Father’s Day,A family dinner. Our first since circuit breaker restrictions eased. Disappointing to be left with menus and have to attract attention to order (20 mins at least). However that was only fault with service. Dishes do appear randomly. So things which go together may arrive far apart. I guess that’s tapas! Food was delicious and we have been many times and would return for sure.
"Good service, some dishes good, some average","I can't comment on the premises themselves as it was a takeaway meal (due to the Covid-19 restrictions at the time).
The staff were quick & efficient with the order (although their on-line order system isn't great).
The food that arrived was a mixed bag with some tapas being good but the main dish, Paella, was a bit bland & average."
Always good,We had our last meal out before Singapore goes into semi lockdown and we decided to support our favourite Spanish restaurant. Don Quijote as usual delivered a decent meal which we thoroughly enjoyed. Hope to be back soon!
"Average Food, Long Waiting Time, Very Dated Decor","We decided to try out a new Spanish restaurant as the one we like is fully booked.

The moment I stepped into this restaurant, I do not like the ambience at all. Everything just seems dated and dull. The curtains (near the aircon) are extremely dirty. Even the dining tables look old. It just doesn’t look welcoming.

Food is average and it took us almost an hour to wait for our paella. It just doesn’t make sense.

This is our first time and will be our last. We will not return."
Sunday brunch with family - ok,"Went for Sunday brunch with the family. The price is good, $58++ for beer/wine and brunch buffet (menu). Food was actually nice and inside was nice too. Only issue is the restaurant is understaffed. The poor waiters (I saw 2 and one bar tender) were running around like little chickens unable to keep up with all the request. I think if you plan for a delay in response it’s not so bad. We ordered several items at once in preparation for that so it wasn’t too much of an issue. I would go back. Croquettes were yummy, garlic mushrooms delicious, our kids enjoyed the pasta with red sauce & meat, garlic shrimp were good too (tiny shrim), red wine was actually nice while the white was a bit to sweet for my taste. Overall a nice change in food from typical Asian/American fair in Singapore."
Food ok Service so so,"visited on a sunday and had their buffet tapas. the only option there actually on a sunday lunch.
the waitstaff attending to us looked abit in a daze, didnt key in our order which resulted in us waiting for 30mins, and rebuted us when he forgot our drinks order.

service recovery by another wait staff saved the day but still left a bitter experience.

would not return as there are better restaurants out there."
relaxed and quick,The food was very nice. Portions could have been a bit bigger especially for the cured meat. Personnel was friendly and attentive although one did not seem to understand english very well and did not seem to know the menu completely. Sangria (red wine) was a nice big jug and tasted good. in all a nice evening
Not my Best Spanish Food,Service was good. Server was helpful in recommending the good stuff. Enjoyed the barramundi very much! Spanish egg was a little too dry Shrimps were good The crabmeat scallop on shell was okay. A little too creamy. Would prefer baguette over buns Mushrooms were okay
"Decent food, very poor service","I went there with my wife on Saturday night with a reservation for 7.30 pm. After we walked in at 7.30, it took about 10 minutes for someone to pay attention to us and show us to our table. After we sat, we quickly chose to order a paella and some sangria. It was difficult to catch the attention of the waiters... When we finally caught the attention of one of them, he told us that there are no more paellas today. So we decided to order some tapas instead. In total we ordered 5 tapas. Every tapas came very slowly and it is only after 2 hours and a half that we got our order completed. During the whole time we saw other tables getting paellas...

The food was decent and the essence of Spanish was captured.

I would however not go back due to the very poor service we received.

Price wise, the restaurant is slightly expensive and it's not worth it considering the service."
Great dining experience,"Service was great and staff was friendly. Food was well over expectation, one of the best Spanish restaurant I visited."
Dinner,Had a really great time at dinner there with the family. The food was really awesome and service warm and very friendly.
Great food,"It’s our nth time eating there and every time it never disappoints. Food & service was great! Our all time favourite is the Seafood Valenciana Paella; gambas; and the beef cubes with blue cheese! OMG, the latter is really very nice! It melts in your mouth! Love it! Highly recommended."
Typical Spanish Restaurant,"Came early and was seated promptly without a reservation. Ordered 4 tapas and 2 mains to be shared by 3 persons. Tapas came not long after but not all at the same time. Portions are very small but this is to be expected. The squid ink fideua and beef steak with blue cheese came much later. All the food taste good but not outstanding. As the place was filling up and no one came to clear our tables or ask us for deserts after some time, we asked for the check and left. Service started well but deteriorated when there are more customers. Total bill came to $136 for 3 persons without drinks."
WEEKEND BOOZY BRUNCH IS THE BEST VALUE YOU GET,"This is my second time here and I’m a little surprised it isn’t more packed. It’s such fabulous value when you head here for the weekend booze brunch. It is $58 inclusive of free-flow ala carte tapas and free-flow white, red wine or sangria. I stuck to my white so I can’t comment on the rest. It’s not the best white but it’s do-able. The tapas are ok, not the best you will ever sink your teeth into but pretty good fare. The croquettes are well done, crispy on the outside and light on the inside. Garlic prawns are garlicky good although it’s not premium prawns you get but at that price it’s superb value. Wings are good and come slathered in tasty sauce. Bacon asparagus, calamari are the other pleasers. Dessert was cheesecake and pudding which were polished off by our party within minutes. This is honestly such great value I would be back again."
Just snackin,"We came around 5ish & there was nobody yet..so dats good! Anyway, we had the mushrooms, chicken wings, fried calamari, potatoes & for desserts, lava cake & fried milk pudding. The food is alright not great but I must say dat their house chillie paste(sambal) was pretty awesome! There’s a new Filipino server & he was juz terrible. I mean since there’s nobody but just us, I wud expect him to take the initiative to actually run thru the menu since he don’t noe anything even the basics wen we asked him initially regards to the food. Anyway, we wud really like to compliment dis young 16-17 yrs old server. He is Sporean & tho he’s shy & all but he actually made effort to assist us wen needed to."
Disappointing,"Unfortunately I think the waiters and chefs were too preoccupied from having finished the brunch. Paella, which took an age to do, was burnt and dry - quite small for a large portion"
Excellent Experience,"We visited Don Quijote on 23rd November with a group of around 20 pax, to enjoy the Saturday brunch sit-down buffet. To be honest, initially we were a little apprehensive, never having been there earlier and we wanted our friends to have a great experience. The reviews were mostly all positive but we were a little troubled by some of the negative reviews.

We took a risk and needless to say, our fears were all unfounded. You have to visit the outlet for yourself to experience the absolutely delightful experience. Alvin & his team were wonderful. quick to serve the Tapas menu, bring up the drinks promptly, always attentive & topping up the glasses frequently. The food was really good, the service superb & every item was carefully prepared every time. The experience was great & it was all our money's worth. If you want to order paella, understandably you need to wait a while for it to be served as it takes time to prepare. You can opt for the alcohol top-up menu or soft drinks menu, whichever suits you. We were one happy bunch with the alcohol option (sangria, wine or beer, free flow)

100% recommended, and absolutely no regrets. Great place!"
"Quaint Restaurant, Good Service","Went there with my friends for an intimate dinner together and didn't regret it. The food was just delicious, and the service staff were attentive to our needs as well. They also provided recommendations when we needed them. We had an arrangement for flowers to be delivered for our friend and the restaurant graciously accepted and made accommodations to take in the delivery before we reached. Would go back again!"
Mother's Birthday celebration,"excellent recommendations of tapas! spicy calamari was on point, everyone loved it. My third time here and the paellas are consistently delicious. Tried the garlic prawns but they are alright..."
Tasty Cuisine <3,It was an amazing meal that includes Tenderloin Steak cube with Blue Cheese and squid ink pasta - the taste just exploded in my mouth! Will be back again for more sangria too!
Always good,"Back for brunch at one of my favourite places at Dempsey As well as the ever excellent scrambled eggs, the gazpacho was flavoursome and for a first.... Stewed pigs feet with white beans was excellent! Great service as always."
Excellent Food and wonderful service,"great food, atmosphere and service! Waited quite a while for the spanish rice but it was worth the wait!"
Happy family brunch,"Fantastic service and tasty food. We opted for Sunday brunch incl free flow juices & soft drink@S$38++ per pax. Well if you are not driving and do not mind top up $20 for free flow beer, wine & sangria."
Worst service ever!,"We went for the Saturday buffet, waited over two hours for food that never came despite asking multiple times for the staff to check on it, they never came back to update us nor apologised for the delays. When we eventually told them to cancel everything and just give us the bill, they didn’t even have the decency to apologise for their horrible service. Don’t bother wasting your money here."
Pleasant Spanish Experience,"We arrive early which was ideal as when the restaurant became more full the friendly staff seemed stretched and unable to cope, forgetting our orders twice. Otherwise tasty food and may consider a second visit."
Excellent Service & Food :),"We had a wonderful dinner setting and the service and food quality was impeccable. We left with some wonderful memories, definitely worth visiting many times over."
Family dinner,"We have been coming here for a long time. It’s 10 pm and diners in groups are still mingling and enjoying the food and drinks.

We ordered the Parma ham and tortilla which is our favourite and of course the paella . For desserts our usual order of their version of lava cake called bomba cake.

Most important thing to us is of course the food is great and its service staff. Kudos to the servers especially to Ms Ling who was very attentive to all the customers here. Well done and keep up the good work!!

See you again !!!!"
Disappointed Spanish Food,"Went there to try out the Spanish food since the reviews are quite good. However, the quality and quantity of food are not as expected. The three of us ordered one medium paella and three hot tapas to share. The medium paella ($48) is barely one inch thick, very little ingredients, instead of using big chunk of chicken like you would see in traditional Spanish paella, we only found some chicken bits and there is very little or no taste of saffron. For the price, a one serving in of paella in marche is way more worth it! Especially in the taste! As for the three tapas- beef cube with blue cheese, bbq prawns ($13) and potato wedges with eggs ($15), all taste mediocre. Beef cube ($20) was served lukewarm and a little tough, definitely not the best beef they used and I think for such price, we can easily have better and bigger steak elsewhere! The bbq prawns uses fresh prawns but that’s about it. As for the potato wedges thingy, it is just some potato with scrambled eggs. Nothing special. Not worth $15 for such trashy fish. Not sure how Spanish it is other than the plates that they used. The quantity is pathetic. We all went for a second dinner after that. Before we left, we overheard the same comments on the quality and quantity of their food as well. Regret wasting time to eat here. We will never ever go back."
Excellent food and Excellent service!,"This place absolutely blew me away! The food was authentic, rich with flavour, beyond my expectations!! And what made the experience wholesome was the amazing service. Ling together with a couple of others served us, Ling especially knew how to take care of us customers and make us feel at home, warm and welcomed! It's really a person like her that makes me want to come back here again and again! She's knowledgeable, friendly, genuine and honest. Glad to have has a wonderful experience here this evening! Thanks Ling!"
Don Quijote,"We went here on a Sat evening, we tried 4 tapas and they were all generally good. The potato wrap in egg, calamari will stand out dishes, I also like the BBQ beef satay, waited too long for the palla but worth the wait as it tasted really good."
Yummy food; great service,They give free tap water upon request. Amazingly soft bread rolls as a starter with garlic butter spread. We have 4 warm tapas and 2 desserts. All were very yummy. Am surely going back to try their paella!
Mind blowing service and food,"its My 1st time dining with Don Quijote, the service is fast and excellent. Food was out within 10-15min upon ordering with the friendly waitress and their sangria with red wine is mind blowing. The best I’ve ever had. Thank you for the fine experience"
Great Affordable Tapas,"My partner and I enjoyed free flow wine, beer and tapas at Don Quiotis. The food was very tasty, and in good portion size, the wine and beer complemented the food and the staff were very attentive. I can't wait to return!"
Great Sunday brunch,"Excellent Sunday brunch buffet. The great thing is that all the food is freshly prepared and not just laid out getting cold.

All the food was excellent and I would highlight the shrimps as being the best. They were also very accommodating towards the one vegetarian in the group."
Nice place,"Located in Dempsey place - a wide variety of tapas (average), good wines and great sea food paellas-(nice hot and freshly made) with good service - anice evening out"
Alright,Sangria solid. Chips good. Paella generous and yum. Suckling pig juicy and crispy. Chicken stew bit of a letdown.. uninspired.
Good as always,"First time going for brunch in a group. Food as good as always and the small helpings allow you to try all the dishes and go back for more of there is one you particularly like.
Could have done with another waiter, but generally a great place to eat."
Nice cosy restaurant,"Nice ambience. Food taste good but tapas portions were really small and pathetic, kinda disappointing."
Good food but really slow service,Good is above average but wait is very long. The waitress with long hair serving our table looked like the whole world owes her a living.
"Great ambience, service & dishes","We had all our old favourites. Barramundi from seasonal menu among the best fish dishes we've ever tasted. Very reasonable prices. Furthermore, we had great savings as we could use our Chope vouchers."
Amazing Food & Top Notch Service!!,"What an amazing brunch we had at DQ! We booked out the restaurant for my sons’ birthday and despite the demands of a large hungry crowd, the staff never failed to deliver a smile with grace and patience. The food was also superb, best Spanish home-style cooking in SG for sure! Ken was also very responsive and helpful leading up to the date. Thank you so much DQ team! We had the best birthday for baby M thanks to you! ❤️"
"nice food, good environment, superb services Spanish food place","we love the Spanish style reno, wine, food, tapas, paella and the services given, definitely a very good place to visit again and again"
Great Sunday Brunch,"When we arrived at 11.30, there were only a couple of tables busy, but by the time we left, it was busy! We could see why, we had a great time! The brunch is free-flow (rather than buffet), as in you order whatever you like off the menu provided and it is cooked for you. We had the calamari, patatas bravas, wings, chorizo, and even re-ordered the croquettes twice, they were so good. Everything was great, nothing crazy or re-inventing the wheel, but really well-done Spanish tapas basics, which was what we wanted. We loved that everything came out fresh and hot, and it was delicious. We thought the servers were all really good, as well. Sometimes in Singapore it can be hard to get the attention of the servers, but we felt that we were attended to just the right amount of time. We have already spoken about coming back again, and look forward to it."
Casual dining,"Ambience is a lot more casual than i thought, a place where you bring old friends, eat and chat. Servers are v helpful and attentive. The only negative was i found the food very salty, esp the squid ink seafood paella."
Good service and delicious tapas,"There is a wide variety of tapas to choose from. We ordered 2 jugs of sangria, calamari, garlic prawns, beef cheeks, croquettes and paellas. They are all delicious. The in-house chili was marvelous too. Worth a visit!"
Tapas restaurant in Dempsey Hill,"Tapas restaurant with all the normal dishes you would expect. Especially seafood paella is tasty. We had a table inside, pretty sterile environment pretty far from Spanish restaurant but suitable for business dinner. Outside seating looked nicer for couples or families."
"Great restaurant with good food, wine and excellent service.","We visited the restaurant for a business dinner and 3 days later I brought my family for dinner.

Great service - staff are friendly, patient, knowledgeable and accommodating. Shoutout to them all especially Jill!

Plus they had a great wine selection - several Spamish wines exclusive to the restaurant.

The food is sumptuous and reasonably priced. Amazing that the restaurant is good for both business and family gatherings!"
Excellent,"The food was above expectations. We had grilled squid chili, prawns, iberico pork and kids pasta. Service staff was very attentive and friendly."
Valentine dinner,Excellent service n food. Staff were so attentive to requests even with packed diners waiting patiently to be served. Thank you for generous bread while waiting.
"Overexpensive and undersized portions, average taste","The meal was way too expensive for the average taste, and the relatively small portions. There were also very few patrons for a weekday evening."
Good mood; Good Food,First of all please please please visit Dempsey Hill area. The place is full of eating places (though highend) Amazing variety of restaurants. So we chose Spanish food @ Don Quijote. Sangria of course is a must have. Food to die for each and every dish ordered was cleaned out in minutes.
Don ever come here,"We managed to make reservations for Sunday lunch just an hour ahead of going down. We were surprised at its availability then, but I guess we aren't now.

Interior:
There was no natural light, and with those mustard yellow walls lit by light not bright or warm enough, it made the entire place look drab. There was also lizard stool on the wall by the table we were given. I requested for another table, but was only attended to by the second wait staff. Perhaps, the first guy didn't hear me ask.

Food:
Of the 4 dishes we intended to order, there were only 2 available. Odd. However, when the food came, we were glad that we didn't order more.

The first dish we ordered is the classic gambas al ajillo (garlic shrimp). If you've ever had it before, you'd know that they usually, and if not always, come sizzling hot. However, after waiting for 15–20 minutes for the food, it came barely warm. It just seemed like it was heated up in a microwave or left on the counter for a while. Neither good.

The other classic Spanish dish we ordered was huevos revueltos (Spanish scrambled eggs). It was very mediocre; it lacked executional finesse. The chorizo (Spanish sausage) tasted more like cheap Taiwanese night-market sausage.

Another observation I made was that the front-of-house staff and the kitchen staff didn't seem united. When I made my inquiry about the food preparation, the service staff were quick to draw a line between themselves and the kitchen team. The chef did offer to make the dish again, but I declined. After taking way longer than needed to deliberate the matter, I appreciate that they eventually did cancel an item from my bill.

Summary: Don('t) eat here."
Lovely evening at Don Quijote,Went on a weekday night. Surprisingly not crowded.went early so parking was not a problem. Enjoyed the paella and the tapas. Food consistently good. Service staff was attentive.
Disorganised... we didn’t get fed!,Our family went for Sunday brunch- the first three dishes came out within 5 mins. The rest of the food was at least an hour per dish and some dishes didn’t even arrive. We had to go somewhere else for lunch because we all left hungry. Dessert didn’t arrive either. Worst experience ever!
So good all these years!,"We have been visiting Don Quijote for a good 8 years! The food is the main reason why we keep coming back. Not to mention, the good service! (Special call out to Ling) Highly recommend the Paella!"
Great food,"Great food and even better service from Ling! Keep it up! 9 years and counting. The paella and tapas are top notch. So flavourful that I get hungry just thinking about it. If you don't drive, the Sangria is really refreshing."
Good,"Food was delicious, selection was not extensive but enough for brunch. Basics were done well. Hidden away at a corner of dempsey, so took us awhile to find it"
Great food great service,This Restaraunt serves authentic Spanish food and yet very tasty. The waitress serving us that day was very friendly and helpful. Will come again.
Experience for Spanish Food,"Restaurant serve average Spanish food.Other then the Seafood paella , the rest do not have the wow factor.Very disappointed with the Spanish suckling pig,Its very dry and oily,need to have sauce for some flavor."
Good Cozy Place for family,Service and Food were good while I was there with my family. Friendly staff and serving quiet fast for every order . I will definitely go there again with my family .
Great food at Don Quijote,food was good and service was efficient. ambience was cosy and it was an experience enjoyed by all. a good place for a group meal.
Good tapas,"We used to get to this restaurant when we were leaving in Singapore a few years ago and we loved this place. We just came back there and we were happy that things have not changed much there. The tapas are still good (chorizo, jamon, cheso, etc). The vegetable paella as well. But Dempsey Hill is no longer a great place and it is slowly dying."
Great food and value for money,"Sunday brunch with free flow red wine sangria. White wine sangria, beers or just soft drinks also available. Great choices of tapas and portion sizes just right so you can try (nearly) everything on the menu. Been a few time and never disappointed"
Delicious!,"Great ambience, anazing tapas. Doesn't get better than this for a tapas night out! And parking was so convenient."
Good value,"We tried the weekend buffets and it was good value for money. Chorizo, cheese cake, chicken, croquetta were good."
Wonderful,"We have been twice to DQ already and we enjoyed the food both times. They take a Long time to take orders, prepare and serve, but it was worth waiting for. Portions’ sizes are solid, quality of food and presentation is good. Recommend it for friends and family outing"
almost everything was just right,"seafood paella, grilled octopus, both were amazing
chorizo with red wine sauce was a miss for me
my partner said the red wine sangria was amazing (and he's had a lot of sangrias)

prior to arriving, i had arranged for the restaurant to serve a cake as a birthday surprise at the end of the meal. they did it wonderfully, with 'happy birthday xxx!' written with strawberry sauce on the plate along with a chocolate lava cake served with ice cream. they were delicious! (paid for, of course).

service was okay, not the most attentive or friendly but it was alright. i still enjoyed myself.

ambience was nice, homely, family-style kind of restaurant. doesnt require formal dressing, which was comfortable."
"Authentic, delicious Spanish tapas","Been here twice now and the food never failed to disappoint! From the paella to the tapas to the sangria, everything was delicious. Not forgetting the bread and butter pudding, for which I came back for and will keep going back for it. Staff was a little lacking in friendliness but the food more than made up for it!"
good tapas restaurant in Dempsey,We frequent this restaurant as the food is excellent value for money. Seafood is fresh and the grilled calamari is excellent. Other dishes we would recommend is the patatas bravas and gambas al ajillo. The soups are also excellent. Service can be stretched at peak times but the waiters/waitresses are always helpful. Warm bread rolls on arrival are a plus.
Average Food / average service / average place,"After trying several higher end Spanish restaurant in Singapore, I was looking for a more casual, more affordable place for family dinner.
Don Quijote is indeed more casual & more affordable. However quality of the dishes proposed remains average - I barely traced back the real taste of Spanish food in what we tried. Only exception was certainly the Ox Tail which was quite convincing.
Staff is friendly but service is average (while pouring sangria, waiter largely spread over the table...).
Inside dining room has nothing fancy, but fortunately you can enjoy al fresco dining."
Food is good but service sucks!!,"My son and I were keen to have a good dinner to celebrate my birthday and after a lot of research narrowed down to Don Quixote.

We reached around 8.45 am to a mostly empty restaurant, probably 3 tables were occupied..We were shown to a table by a very surly and unhappy looking waitress. Ordered drinks and a few Tapas and they came promptly.

Food was good and everything was bearable till we asked for more bread and then things went down....the waitress rudely told us that more bread would cost us extra...I just looked at her And then she added “$1 for a piece”...seriously??!!

One, why tell customers who have come to a pricey restaurant that bread is going to cost extra? Two, who charges extra for bread in the first place. And three, will $2 really matter for someone who is ready to spend over $100 on dinner!!

My 13 year old and I just looked at each other, shook our heads and laughed...

Anyway, the bread came after 10 minutes by which time we were through with the Tapas.

No smiles, no follow ups, no checking on main course...

We asked for the bill, paid and left to finish the rest of our dinner to another restaurant in Dempsey...

Hope Don Quixote achieved its sales and profit targets for the day by charging us $2 for the 2 pieces of bread...

First visit and the last..."
awesome dinner with my family,"this is my second time here, and I brought my relatives this time round. the clams with white wine is highly recommended as my family really love it. and paella is a must to order, I would say don quijote had once of the best paella in Singapore. highly recommended!"
Really Casual,"If you need to spend a night in a relaxed mode with your friends an have multiple dishes with finger friendly food with exquisite taste, this is absolutely one of my favourites. Friendly personnel can guide to through the plentyfold tapas as well as through the wine list. And at the same time you can enjoy the nice Dempsey with its plaura of evening opened shops. Please enjoy!"
Dinner with family,"Had a delicious dinner especially the paella and the other small dishes like sausages, ham and cheese which was TOP up by Sangria. Friendly staff and nice ambience ."
Always the best!,"Dog-friendly restaurant (outdoor seating). Staffs are always friendly, very attentive even if you're seated outdoor.
Best part... the food never disappoint. We'll always visit this place to celebrate occasions (birthdays, anniversaries) or simply just to satisfy our cravings.

Must order:
Squid in its own ink
Garlic Prawn
Seafood Paella (al dente)
Oxtail (yums)
Hokkaido Scallops

Dip the bread in those garlic oil after your garlic prawns!"
TGIF spanish dinner,celebrated a friend’s birthday there and the service was amazing. the seafood paella was awesome too!
Catch up,"Catching up with a new or old friend over a drink with some lite bites or full dinner - Don Quijote gives you a choice. Located in cozy Dempsey Hills with free parking. The staff was attentive and our orders were promptly taken.
We ordered Sangria red - pretty good standard. I am not a big eater for dinner thus went with the hot tapas. We liked the croquette con jamon and the egg plant in a casserole soup based.
The atmosphere was conducive for chatting. However, I felt the acoustics could be better managed as when the noise level goes up, it was difficult to listen to my dining companion.
Would probably return to try the desserts - churros."
Not good enough,Service was poor. Main course delivered separately. Atmosphere was not great. Food wasn't bad but poor value for money
"Great Food, Great Service","My husband held a surprise birthday party for me at Don Quijote for about 60 persons. The owner Ken went out of his way to source for the cake, balloons and the band! Ken is a foodie, so he really puts his heart and soul into the food preparation.

Everyone, from 1 year old to 70 years old, enjoyed the night. As expected, the garlic shrimps, green beans, paella and sucking pig were great. We have never tried the roast beef prior to the party and one of my friends said the roast beef was one of the best she has had.

Definitely our favourite Spanish restaurant in Singapore. The atmosphere is laid back and you feel like you are eating with family."
Average weekend buffet,"Simple tapas buffet with average food. Service wasn't great.. one of the staff was rather rude. Visit once is enough, unlikely to come back again."
A Disappointment,"This was my second visit to the restaurant. Being the new year's eve, the place was a bit crowded and the service standard was not as good, which is understandable but there must be no compromises on food quality. I ordered a Tortilla Espanola which was so salty and totally inedible.
What a meal to end the year !"
Good satisfying food...,The food was well made and satisfying. Enjoyed each of the three we tried. Will definitely visit again.
Good authentic Spanish food,Food was really very good and reasonably priced for Spanish food. Good service and very nice cosy restaurant. Love everything about this place!! Will definitely patronize this place again!!
The worse brunch in Singapore,"We met with my two friends for brunch at Don Quijote today. The entire experience was very poor there. The ambiance and deco were sordid, the food was defrost and tasted the same as the food in some bad quality bars. Everything there was far from being acceptable and definitively cannot be called Spanish food, it is an insult to the Spanish cuisine."
Give this place a miss,"Our whole experience dining at Don Quijote was a disappointment.
We dined here on a Monday night so we were not expecting too much with regards to the atmosphere in the restaurant. The service was mediocre and the lady who served us was very unenthusiastic and clearly did not want to be there on a Monday night.

However the biggest let-down of the night was the food.
Every dish that we ordered was disappointing. The produce used were clearly frozen - frozen prawns, frozen squid and what was to be Paella tasted like tasteless squid ink fried rice. For the quality of food served, the bill of $180 for 3 adults was quite ridiculous (considering we only had one drink each).

I don't normally believe in writing bad reviews for a restaurant, I would normally just move on and never go back, but Don Quijote is far from below average and a huge disappointment. Go elsewhere, so many other amazing Spanish restaurants around."
Weekend lunch buffet,It's my second time at this restaurant for their weekend lunch buffet. Very reasonable and wide variety of Tapas. Highly recommended if you have guest visiting SG and don't fancy asian food.
Great service and decent food,It’s not the best Spanish restaurant but the service and ambience certainly makes up for it. Great variety of tapas. Expected better chorizo have to say. The mushrooms and the shrimps are recommended. The wine list is great but the servers didn’t know enough about them. We tried the lava cake and found it just about ok and overpriced.
Nice ambience and good food,Cosy ambience with friendly staff. Nice place for gatherings. Food was yummy - a wide selection of tapas and mains to choose from.
Good service but not so on the food,"A good concept, good location and ok ambiance. The staff were friendly and attentive. The let down was the food. Being a Spanish restaurant I would expect the Chorizo and anchovies to be of good quality and reminiscent of what you would find in Spain. It was however not the case."
Birthday celebration with family,"Celebrated daddy's birthday here, armed with 4 children. Table was set up with highchairs and children cutlery as agreed. Service staff were knowledgeable, patient and friendly. Food arrived quickly and was yummy. Good value for money. This is a return visit and would come again!"
Sunday Spanish brunch,"Restaurant serves up delicious food. I would recommend the potato dishes. However, the steak and Spanish eggs were under seasoned.

Decor and atmosphere is comfortable. High quality food ingredients, things here taste fresh.

One big grip I have is the saltiest of the Paella

Would recommend this place for a gathering and causal lunch but food wise..not the best Spanish restaurant in singapore in my opinion."
Good service,Service is good. Food is served within minutes. Food is nice but could be better. Only one draught beer selection (Estrella). Good ambience.
Great meal and awesome service!,"The brunch deal is amazing, the food selection was great and had some vegetarian options for my friend so that was much appreciated. The sangria was well made and quickly topped up. Service was quick and with a smile :) Definitely will go again!"
"Good food, Good ambience","Visited several times.... love the beef cubes with blue cheese sauce & garlic prawns. ambience was great, good place to catch up with friends for chat as it is not noisy like many other places."
"Good Service, brunch food was good but can be better.","Service was good. Staffs were attentive and knows their menu well. Place needs renovation, change of curtains. Food, Chicken stew was so so. Croquettas - they can make it smaller and more portion rather than 1 big ball. Garlic shrimp taste good, but the shrimp used seems to be frozen. Asparagus wrapped in bacon - quite salty. Maybe they can use a low sodium bacon?!"
Fantastic food and service,"My second time there, food is still as good as always. One of the best Spanish restaurants in Singapore I've tried. Service crew is always readily available and friendly throughout the whole meal. Will definitely go back there for another meal soon."
