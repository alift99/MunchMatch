Amazing birthday dinner!,Food was beautiful and tasty! Great service and ambiance. will definitely come back and recommend it to friends
Our favourite meal in Singapore,"We were greeted by the waiting staff and made to feel so welcomed and at ease straight away.
We were given a menu of ingredients and asked to let them know what we preferred not to eat.
Our table was near the kitchen so that we could watch the chefs preparing our food. The individual chefs came to our table to serve the food and explain what they had put together for us. Everyone was cheery and polite. So refreshing. The waiting staff were so helpful and attentive.
It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish. Thank you."
Best dinner in a long long time,"This is a fantastic place, sadly opened only in the evening for dinner and Friday for lunch. The food is fantastic, really amazing, keen to go back asap"
One of a kind dining experience,"Visited this lovely restaurant with my partner after a friend recommended we try it. Stunning food, every single bite was perfection. Lovely wait staff and cocktails were lovely too!"
Birthday Dinner,"Had a birthday celebration with my family at this restaurant that is tucked away from the Hussle and bussle in Central Singapore (Chinatown and CBD is just nearby). An excellent place to chill out over great food and wonderful people.

Every dish presented is of top quality exquisitely crafted and cooked to perfection. Your taste buds are treated to a fanfare of flavours and textures like the world was celebrating the world cup victory in your mouth.

Highly recommended for people who loves food and who are looking for a chill place to wind down after a long day."
Great hospitality and food,Chefs table never fails to deliver. We had an exceptional time there for a birthday celebration with the new Omakase menu and wine pairing . The restaurant manager is very knowledgeable with his wine selection . Definitely will come back again . Thanks for the warm hospitality.
"Tasty food, good service","Food was nice, though you have to be a fan of fusion food to enjoy it. Great that they offered customer to try the wine even for orders by the glass.

Good service with staff giving clear explanations of dishes and non-intrusive service."
Perfection ü§ó,"The food was amazing! Not just tasty, but also very beautifully presented! We will definitely come back again"
Best meal we have ever eaten!!!,This was AMAZING! Our first trip to Chef's Table. We chose the 6 course evening menu with wine pairing. Every course and every glass of wine was sumptuous and a delight to the taste-buds. We were dining with vegan friends who had a totally different menu to us but they were equally impressed. We will return again soon. It was not cheap though :-) so save it for a special occasion!
Will Be Back,"We had enjoyed chef‚Äôs dishes at an HSBC event last month, and the entire table decided to try a meal at his restaurant as well.

We opted for the $98 4 course set lunch, and the ingredients were fresh. They will ask you if you have any allergies or food preferences.

The eatery has nice vibes and decor, as well as a glassed in show kitchen, and staff were friendly and efficient, and also took pains to explain the dishes, which were well presented.

The meal was well curated, with balanced flavours and quality ingredients. Our favourite was the beef done in two ways. Dessert was nice, and we thought the weakest dish, if that might be called, was the hamachi starter - it had nice tart and citrus notes, but the fish was slightly ‚Äúfishy‚Äù.

It was a good lunch, and we decided to come back to try the other set lunches."
Great night out! Food and service top notch,One of the best dining experiences we had in Singapore (and that‚Äôs saying a lot)! The food was creative and delicious. The service was spot on. While not cheap this restaurant is a true value considering the quality of their product. Will definitely come back next time in town.
Lovely time with some really delectable dishes at Chef's table.,Starting the new year with good mates and a little indulgence at @chefstable_61tras . We had starters that used Egyptian star flowers which apparently is grown all over Singapore as shared by the chef. The prawns from Argentina and cod was beautifully done. The cod literally melts in the mouth. Good recommendation of wine to go with the meal and decent pricing as well for the wines.
A Very Pleasant Experience,"It was the night before the R√©veillon and I really wanted something special for my loved ones. And indeed, it WAS special. We were explained what each dish contained and every ingredient was carefully plated in a harmonious and eye catching manner. We had pleasant surprises on each plate and were advised which wine is better for the menu. Crockeries and cutleries had interesting features and were changed after every course.
All was very good, but for me the foie gras stood out.

While I enjoyed thoroughly the experience, I must admit that this might not be for everyone and not on daily basis for a number of reasons.

But for that special night of the year, be it Christmas, New Year‚Äôs Eve, a birthday, an anniversary or simply that meal comforting meal taken when you‚Äôd like to stop the clock for a while, I would highly recommend Chef‚Äôs Table.

Thank you for having us. The European me needed that respite."
Awesomely awesome,"Great atmosphere, lovely food and all things considered for Singapore, not bad value. My only question is why all the staff looked like they‚Äôd shopped at Uniqlo, wearing various combos of jeans and checked shirts. Maybe some sort of uniform - at least some consistency Like all black. But service was good‚Ä¶"
So so,"Food was average. Each dish was good but as an overall experience, all the dishes flavour were heavy. Expected a little more‚Ä¶
However, service was excellent - friendly and fun"
V Enjoyable Xmas Dinner at Chef‚Äôs Table,"My family had a wonderful dinner at Chef‚Äôs Table on Christmas night. Every dish was a beautifully plated surprise & a delightful combination of delicious flavours! Great service from the staff too which added to the warm, unpretentious & cosy atmosphere!

Chef Stephen also catered to rest of the family at home with the takeaway dinners which left them all with very satisfied tummies!

Overall, very worth it for the food quality and price performance. Will return again!"
Yummy Xmas lunch,Loved the food and how the chef come up with some unusual pairing of ingredients. Foie gras is definitely one of the best I‚Äôve had. The burrata and soy sauce was amazing. Love the details for every dish. Absolutely worth it and will definitely come back again to try other dishes.
Anniversary dinner,"Food was great. I ordered the 8 course and my wife the 6 course. Everything was executed well, bar one or two misses. The scallop and hamachi were especially good. The food in general had great depth of flavour, was well balanced and many different textures. One feedback I had was that certain dishes I had such as the wagyu beef and iberico pork were pretty similar in delivery- both were fork tender and perfectly cooked, and finished off in a demi-glace- while delicious, was slightly repetitive on the palette since they came back to back. Another point is that the atmosphere and lighting is more casual, so might have to take that into consideration if you want some place quiet and with a nice ambience. Service was very efficient and friendly, and they even prepared an additional cake to celebrate our anniversary. Very nice touch. Overall, good dining experience!"
Utterly WOW,"First time trying a western style omakase meal and I am totally blown away by the experience. While I was looking forward to the red meats, it was actually the seafood that really stole the show for me. Every sauce was on point, elevating each course to something that was delightful and memorable. Special mention to the staff for being attentive and patiently answering all my questions. My partner and I were taken on a gastronomic journey and we look forward to coming back again. If you're tired on typical restaurant fare, take a chance with the Chef's Table and be wowed."
Awesome meal experience,"The service was very friendly and personalized! Two of my friends have quite a few eating restriction and was worried that she won‚Äôt be able to enjoy the meal but it turned out well! My friend was so happy with the 6 course meal she had! The ambiance was chill and lovely, we had a wonderful experience here!"
"One of my favourites, and it's got better","Been many months since I was able to visit, and this restaurant - always one of my favourites - has got better and better. The food is up a notch on the consistent high quality, with really interesting combinations, flavours and tastes. The wine pairing is always exceptional here. I gfo with high expectations, because I've always had great experiences here, and on this occasion, those expectations were exceeded."
To Die For Dining Experience,"The whole experience was to die for.
Food was impeccable.
Service was top notch...everyone was so attentive.
Love the decor - it was so intimate it felt like I was having a private dining experience at a friend's house."
Delicious food,"We went for a birthday dinner. The concept of this restaurant is a western Omakase and you just tell them the ingredients you don‚Äôt like and they come up with a meal for you. We went for the 8 course and every single course was beautifully plated, well balanced and very delicious. The staff are warm and unpretentious. We are looking forward to our next visit!"
Amazing Dining Experience,"Amazing atmosphere, service and most importantly; innovative and delicious food at a reasonable price point. Will be back again for sure."
Michelin Dining Experience,"Not the first, neither will it be the last visit...
Always great to be back here at Chef's Table! It's the #1 selection for friends after their 1st visit there!
Michelin-star Food from Chef & team and Personalized Service for returning customers from Manoj & team.."
"Amazing Food, and Great Dining Experience","Celebrated wedding anniversary, and what a great choice of restaurant. Opted for the 6 courses, and the food was amazing, portions were great too! superb value for money for this experience!

looking forward to dining here again soon!"
Amazing Restaurant for Dates and Special Occasions,"Went for my boyfriend's birthday and food was amazing!
Had the 6 course dinner and the passion for gastronomy delight is reflected in every course. Service was great too, love the interaction and attention.
Would definitely be back for more!
Please try it at least once, you won't regret it!"
Amazing Food Awesome Service Great Dinning Experience,"We went there to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday. It was our first time there and we are in love with the place. Beautiful and delicious dishes cooked with fresh ingredients. Service was exceptional, very warm and friendly staff. Will highly recommend this place for celebrations and dinner to make memories. Thank you gram Chef‚Äôs Table!"
"Amazing food, great service. Wonderful dining experience","Celebrated our anniversary there. It was an absolutely wonderful experience with great food, service and ambience. We opted for the 6 course meal and each dish was cooked to near perfection. The ingredients used were fresh and tasty, and the flavours in each dish all went well together. My partner was vegetarian with several dietary preferences, yet Chef Stephan managed to put together an amazing and creative meal for her. We will definitely be return again in the near future. Thanks once again for a wonderful dinner."
"Great food, service, atmosphere and value",Had a great dinner with my wife there. Loved the omakase concept whereby they give you the menu of the list of ingredients they use for the dishes and you can pick and choose from there. Chef Stephan and his team cooked up a great meal and service and ambience was great. Will definitely go back and good value for what you get
Wonderful dining experience,"Had my anniversary dinner at Chef‚Äôs table. It was very memorable. The food was wonderful and done to perfection. We opted for wine pairing and the entire experience was great. Lovely wine, good food, great service. We loved it!"
Birthday lunch,"Thank you for a wonderful lunch!! We absolutely loved all the dishes, and the fact that vegetarian food was fantastic too

Hope to drop in again soon."
Awesome food! Great experience!,Food variety is well thought through. The pairing of food in each dish is amazing. Like the vibe in the restaurant.
Unique and Fantastic restaurant,"Our 2nd time visited Chef‚Äôs Table for Friday relaxing lunch. Western Omakase style, food was delicious, unique and fantastic, with wonderfully attentive staff. Will definitely visit again and again."
Fresh ingredients for a fantastic meal,"I've eaten food catered by Chef before, but this was the first time I ate in the restaurant and it was amazing. Every dish was full of flavor and hit the spot. I also enjoyed the wine pairing, the atmosphere and the friendly staff. I can't wait to go back!"
Husband's birthday,It was a fabulous dinner. The food was simply amazing! Love the relaxed vibe of the place. Definitely will return again.
Up there with one of the best meals I‚Äôve ever had.,"Recently arrived from Australia. Exquisite presentation of plates and loved the chefs explanations. Tasted divine. Was very special.

Very very casual place where you sit at high tables.

Super expensive (compared with Australia :@ circa $460 although the food component was only $200 for two people)."
Birthday Dinner,"Celebrated Husband‚Äôs birthday at Chef‚Äôs Table. Went with the 8 Course Dinner with 4 glasses wine pairing.
We enjoyed the dinner tremendously."
"Food is very good, staff is friendly but atmosphere can be improved.","First I want to highlight that really all of the staff members were really friendly and trying to accommodate us. Food wise there is nothing what I could say negative. It was really good wonderful experience. Also I have to say they‚Äôre really speaking very fast when explaining the food and dishes. I think if they would just add 20 seconds more it could help to understand the chefs better.

Two negative points are still there: on is the atmosphere and the set up of the restaurant. But maybe this is my personal preference. I think the high chairs or not comfortable at all which makes the quality of sitting and eating not really amazing. I‚Äôm fine with high chairs in the bar for casual food and drinks but for this level of food and dining I would prefer proper chairs and tables.

The other thing what I think is not suitable for a restaurant which is a little bit in the higher price range is the attire of the stuff. Even if they don‚Äôt have a dress code like everybody is wearing black or black-and-white I would appreciate something more neutral so I guess can roughly recognise who is the staff member. As I said some of the things I have no problem in a casual bar but for this category of dining a Nice attire is a must. (and sports shoes is a no go in a restaurant of this category for staff member)

But as I said the stuff is very friendly and I assume it‚Äôs not their fault that they are dressed like this because if the management doesn‚Äôt ask for proper attire they are not to blame for it."
Expected more,"Based on the past reviews I let myself have higher expectations for this place. Although it was fine, it was not special and something I'd return to.

Firstly the bread cost $5 per pax. Even fine dining restaurants charging far more or normal restaurants do not do this. Especially if the bread was not something special made in house with some unique spread. This gave me a really poor image of the place front he get go.

Service was decent although I believe that the explanations for the food can be less rushed. Especially since it's an omakase you'd expect some more information about the food, style or story if any.

The food was not special. Expected to have something special but it was just that. Average food on a plate. Good portions which I appreciate. Had no real cohesion with the flavours. The dishes were things you'd find at any other restaurant as they were very safe and lacked finesse. For example the Tuna Tartare had white veins or fibres inside. Which is just meat that's not minced properly.

Disappointed as the reviews were so fantastic."
Excellent,"Elegant atmosphere, very relaxing, chef has an amazing team, they were all working together as a team. Excellent experience, and every dish was like an art piece with a different and unique taste."
Mama Mia,Perfect and best fine dine with friendly staff. Simply love the menu. Had a 8-course meal. All dishes surprises me and raise my palate to the next level. Highly recommended.
I‚Äôd give it six stars if possible!,"This was our first and very long-awaited visit. The whole experience was fantastic. The service was superb, the food delicious and great wine recommendation (we chose not to do the pairing).
I have various dietary restrictions and they still managed to serve me an impressive meal alongside the rest of my group.
Not a cheap evening but the food menu pricing is absolutely worth it for what you get. Wines are also reasonably priced for this type of establishment.
Can‚Äôt wait for our next visit already!"
"Interesting dishes that show creativity, but the decor needs a rethink","I'm not one for menus where the chefs dictate what I will eat, but at least Chef's Table allows you to tell them what you don't like or want. The six-course selection I ordered ($128 before tax) was more than enough to have me rolling our satiated, but then again, I'm a light eater. The dishes were very imaginative, albeit have a somewhat one-dimensional taste (there was a lack of sweet, sour, spicy, tangy, which was surprising given that I had five courses before dessert. Of course, I'm nitpicking (as one should in these sorts of reviews). All the dishes were very carefully thought out and prepared to perfection. The nice wooden table tops and spot lighting provided ample opportunities to turn out nice IG pics.

Service was excellent and the chef came out to explain each dish in detail. The staff was ever alert to make sure my glass of water was full, to a point where I had to say, ""easy, boy, let me finish this glass first"".

I instructed the kitchen that I was dairy-free and shy away from red meat, and they had no problem curating dishes that met my requirements. In fact, the dessert of sorbet, raspberries, and strawberries with slices of pavlova proved so delicious that my wife preferred it to her chocolate-based one.

All in all, a lovely night out and a most satisfying meal. Now if only they're re-think that book-shelf/wine table furnishing on the side of the restaurant that only served to distract me from the delicious dishes."
Best Dinner out !,Wonderful relaxed atmosphere in this lovely restaurant. Amazing food and wine with a friendly attentive service . This is our favourite go to restaurant here in Singapore
Great experience,"Had a great time: surprising flavours along the 6 course menu paired with surprising wines, great for the eyes and the palet !"
Just Awesome!,Been coming back for dinner on a monthly basis since March 2021 after the first visit. My husband and I have very different palates so being able to choose what goes into our food is just great. There has not been a single dish that we did not enjoy. The whole dining experience is made perfect with wonderful service team. Looking forward to my dinners in the coming months!
Amazing experience,"I visited the place a second time and am very happy with the experience. Friendly and professional service, relaxed atmosphere, nice wine selection and wine paring. The food is amazing, and can easily accommodate food allergies and restrictions. Beautiful plating, different textures and high quality ingredients. Do not even consider skipping the dessert ;-)"
"Casual ambiance, Exceptional dining experience, Flawless","Had lunch with my wife. What an exceptional and memorable dining experience. The service was attentive. Both of us had our own diet restrictions which was noted and thereafter,....magic occured! We had the 4 course menu since it was our first visit and style (Omakase). Every course we had not only Chef Stephan come out to explain the dish prepared but a member of the culinary team. We engaged with them as some of the produce we were curious on where they would procure them as well as the taste and flavour profile. Every single dish was a beautiful orchestra that played in your mouth. Absolutely divine!
I‚Äôm struggling to find something for the team to improve on. Flawless.
Since we were the last to leave at lunch managed a short conversation with the star himself- Chef Stephan. So humble but clearly someone who prides himself on the quality of the food prepared.
Definitely coming back, this time for dinner with a glass or two of wine so that we can test Manoj
Thanks for a memorable dining experience. With the year we‚Äôve all had, a bright spark, nice to treasure these memories. You guys contributed to that. Well done! . What an awesome team with an inspirational and humble leader!"
"Chef's Table = Amazing food, wonderful team, great vibe!",My family and I have dined at Chef's Table a number of times and this is by far the most exceptional and consistent restaurant in Singapore. The food is delicious and innovative and the staff are always warm and highly professional. Simply amazing! Already looking forward to our next visit...
Great Lunch Experience,We have been to Chef's Table for dinner many times but this was our first lunch experience. The quality of the food and service are amazing. The detail and mix of flavors that goes in to each dish always impresses us. I would definitely recommend it.
Chef‚Äôs Table Scores Top Marks,"This was our first visit and we sat by the door. It was light and airy and the vibe was good. We didn‚Äôt get to see the kitchen in action, so next time would request a table near the back. Service was perfect - attentive but not intrusive. We went for lunch and chose the 4 course premium menu. We also chose the fish for the main course. We thought that this meant that some courses would include meat, but that the main course would be fish. In fact all 3 savoury courses were fish/seafood based. Which was fine by us, but next time we would try the meat option. All courses were packed with interesting flavours, textures and aromas. We had a glass of Loire Sauvignon Blanc too - it was delicious. Chef Stephan and his staff looked after us really well and we‚Äôll definitely be back again."
Consistent Top Class Dining Experience,"We have been to Chef's table multiple times over the years and my wife and I are always amazed at the creative and unusual dishes. The fact that the menu changes so often means you can go back frequently and always experience something new.
The atmosphere is lively but you can easily have a conversation. The tables are high and are arranged very well so as not to have interruptions from other diners. There are three tasting menu options 4,6 or 8 courses. We always go for the 8 course and this has never disappointed, we are full but not uncomfortable.
Each dish is presented to the table by one of the chefs and is explained in detail with visible passion. The wine list is not extensive, but they do permit corkage (1 for 1) in case you have a special bottle you wish to bring. In fairness the restaurant wine list has more than enough options to suit all budgets.
For me this is a top five restaurant in Singapore and whilst it is not a low price, it is very good value considering the quality of ingredients and the expertly crafted (and innovative) dishes. I would highly recommend this restaurant for pretty much all occasions and we will definitely be returning in the not too distant future."
"Delectable 8-course omakase menu, friendly staff.","Hosted by an attentive, friendly team at Chef's Table by Chef Stephan Zoisl (@chefstable_61tras ) Tucked into a delectable 8-course western-style omakase meal, accompanied by ros√© champagne. The concept is simple. You inform the staff about you can't eat (or simply want more, like wagyu!) and wait to be pleasantly surprised.

Every dish was light on the palate, tastefully constructed and beautifully presented in a medley of flavours. Plus it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket too! They change their menu every 3-4 weeks and reservations are highly recommended."
What a delight...,"Had an excellent 6 course meal. The portions were just right and all the dishes were well balanced. Service was excellent as well, very friendly staff. Definitely a recommend for anyone who wants excellent food in a casual environment. I‚Äôll be back for sure."
"Amazing food, Excellent service","Definitely an omakase experience not to be missed.

The food simply amazing and bursting with flavour.

We Loved that the service was attentive and warm.

Kudos to Manoj, for his wonderful wine pairing suggestions and service too!

We'll be back again for sure!

p.s they'll make sure you never have the same menu everytime you're there"
Friday Premium Lunch Set,"I like the dining concept at Chef Table. Basically, you will be presented with an ingredient list. All you have to do is to tell the staff which ingredient you do not want and leave the rest to the chef! This omakase experience is awesome because I'm pretty intrigued by every course. I booked about 1.5 months in advance for their friday lunch special. I will be back again!"
Amazing culinary jounrwx,"Celebrated my husbands birthday and we were so happy for this Choice. Every dish was amazing and such a culinary joy including all senses . We choose the 6 course menu and it was perfect . Just the desert wasn‚Äôt too my liking as my favorite deserts are basic and sweet so creative deserts don‚Äôt do anything to me. We had Rickie as our waiter and
He was brilliant . We can highly recommend
The chefs table . It is worth it ."
Our Dining Experience,The restaurant is simple but classy. It gives a very warm and cosy atmosphere. The staff service is very good. The food is excellent and the portion is just right. Thank you for the experience.
Great food and atmosphere!!,"The food is amazing and umami.
Service staff is very patient and friendly!
My family really enjoyed the dining experience, thought we were on an episode of Masterchef :)"
An interesting fine dining lunch,"An interesting fine dining experience. The ambience is very casual and they have attentive friendly services.
They have quite limited spaces but it can give you a warm homey feeling.
After seating, you will be given a piece of paper, it is not a menu but showing you the available ingredients for the day.
You let them know which ingredients that you do not like (and you also can tell which ones that you love) and choose between 'fish' or 'meat' for your main dish. You also choose which meal course that you want. The chefs will prepare the dishes like japanese's 'omakase' style - based on the available ingredients.
You will also be asked for your preference of the Nordaq water whether prefer a still or a sparkling water.
As per standard, they will give you assorted breads with butter in the beginning.
For every dish, the chef will come to personally explain the dish for you, just like the MasterChef competitor explain the dish in front the judges.
We took the classic 4 lunch course (only available on Friday, other timings are for dinner).
The first course was the best dish, very delicious and unique. I only remember that had smoked salmon, something like sashimi, fish roe, rice cracker (looked like paper, very crispy) and avocado puree.
The second dish basically was a prawn bisque with brocolli puree, croutons and egg yolk. It was tasty and pleasant.
My wife's third dish was a grilled fish with saffron sauce. It was a bit too salty to our liking though the taste was blended quite perfect.
My third dish was three slices of grilled meats with a piece of thick braised beef (cheek?). The braised beef was really tender and the grilled meats are perfect but I found the meat broth sauce was quite salty.
The four dish was a lava cake with passionfruit sherbet and cuts of mango. It was a balanced dessert where the tanginess of the passionfruit sherbet balancing the sweetness of the lava cake. Love it! ... But I did not like the passionfruit sauce/puree that were dotting the plates. They were too strong with a bitter after taste.
Their attendees are very attentive and friendly. It was quite amazing to hear one of them (Ricky) talked to us in casual Bahasa Indonesia even though he is a Northern Indian.
Please try to reserve the table beforehand (just search in the internet or call +6562244188 or drop an email to chefstable@2015L.com) and you also can tell if you have any special dietaries preferences.
For Magicbox package users who did not like alcoholic drinks, I do not really suggest to change it to 'juices' because I think they are giving commercial juices, not making freshly home made juices."
Wonderful Evening,This was a delayed valentine dinner. The food was excellent with lots of nice surprises. Staff were very helpful and genuine firendly.
Delightfully Original Cuisine,"My husband and I went for dinner and both had the 6 course menu. I found the food inventive, flavorful and well balanced."
Best Steak Ever,Easily the best meal I've eaten in Singapore in years. The standard was raised with every course and my 8 course dinner was concluded with a beautiful plated dessert. The main course of tenderloin with beef cheek and mushroom duxelle wrapped in a crepe was absolutely delicious and the steak was perfectly tender and juicy. Will definitely return for more delicious treats should the chance arise. This restaurant seemed to be ideal for dates with all the happy couples dining around us and the food is sure to please even critical foodies.
Treasure In Tras Street ( Tanjong Pagar ),"Great Service, Fine food, Fine wine,
Texture of the food is interesting,flavorful,fresh
The team are vibrant,professional and super friendly
Drop by to said hello to Mr Manoj and the Team
Thanks for the hospitality Cheers Good Jobs"
Great experience at the Chef,"Great experience at the Chef table. Second time and the only thing that changes is the ingredient list selected with care by the Chef and his team. Service, ambiance and quality remain excellent. Congrats and thank you"
A Great Food Adventure,"My life is Vegetarian, and I love my meat. So finding a great cuisine in Singapore for us both can be tough. Chef's Table's simple approach on ingredients meant we both had a wonderful evening, full of new flavours paired with some great wines. We will be back"
Really excellent and also consistent,One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Consistently high quality. Staff are really excellent too. Attentive but not irritatingly so... they find a nice balance. The food is just so good. Cannot really find fault. Just love the experience.
Gluten Free Catered For,"Omakase and if I recall correctly we went 6? Courses plus cheese. Food was terrific with many standouts. In particular, the banana based dessert was outstanding."
Beautiful & Flavourful Meal like an Art,Dining while watching Chefs in action. Each course meal came to the table beautifully and flavourful. Chef Stephan is very passionate and enggaging! He will take some time to bring one of the course on your table and describe it like an art. Chef‚Äôs table is located at Tras street where shophouses are conserved pre-war building. One of the best restuarant in Singapore. My 3rd time and looking forward to bring my family so that they can have an awesome food experience. Thanks to the team for the the great service and always happy/satisfied in our favorite table #1!
5 stars,Very original menu and a lot of work put in. Very very good food. One my favourite restaurants in Singapore
a delicious lunch - definitely to be repeated,"Food, service and atmosphere were all wonderful. Dietary restrictions accommodated with ease. The wine specials were completely reasonable. We will come again!"
"Very good food, unpretentious location","Really exceptional food: my guests refused to give up their main course plates until the waiter had brought them some bread to wipe up the rest of the sauce, it was that good. I'd rate this as some of the best food in Singapore. Superb wine pairing. Attentive service, and a Chef who's making sure that everything served under his name is good.

There's no menu, they bring you what they've cooked today from the best ingredients they have. Requests to avoid a couple of specific ingredients were catered for with a minimum of fuss.

If you're looking for glitz and glamour you're in the wrong place; it's a nice restaurant, but they concentrate on the food, not the decor. If you're looking to gorge on US-size portions you're also in the wrong place: portions are a decent size and you don't leave hungry, but they're looking to feed you not fatten you for slaughter."
Michelin price for average tiny portions food,"Having been to many fine dining restaurants/hotels with posh settings at similar price range, I have to say this is very poor value for money. It's your average restaurant in Tanjong Pagar area, with 2 very basic toilets and 2 shared basins outside the toilets (not what you would expect for this price point). Waiters are not uniformed as commented by another reviewer and one of them has a tattooed arm (well exposed) but well perhaps not every guest has an issue with it.

We ordered 2 sets of 4 courses and 1 set of 8 courses with 2 bottles of wine ($98++ each). The damage was more than $600 for 3 pax. The cold bread is chargeable (we had to ask for it to be warmed up). Food and wine is passable and nothing spectacular/impressionable as what you would expect of this price point except that the portions are extremely small.

We stated our food preferences to the waiter right at the start. I specifically asked for seafood. I can't recall what the first 2 out of the 4 dishes I ordered were, just that the food occupied 20% of the large plates (mostly garnishings/sauces). The reviewers' photos did warn me that the portions are small but when half of my courses still didn't half fill me (I'm a small eater), I asked for bread which was not offered voluntarily as most other western restaurants do.

By the third dish, there was still no seafood. I rejected the third dish as the medium rare beef was too raw for me. We were not asked how well we wanted our beef. I asked if I can have a seafood dish since this was communicated right at the start. I was offered a pork dish instead. By this time I was really puzzled why I can't have some scallop/prawns when I have to pay $100 for my meal (I can have a large crab at a seafood restaurant). The waiter finally came out with one scallop decorated with garnishings and sauces. OK at least I have one scallop!!! The last dish was fish. The learning point - insist on what you want since you are paying the bill!

For the price, the portions are minute, passable food and given you won't know what you get (even when you tell them what you like you still may not get it), you are better off going to one that you can order what you want, pay the same price tag and get a much higher class experience as you will feel more pampered. Having said this, there was no major unpleasantness - the waiters are fine. Just nothing spectacular. I won't be going back."
Amazing experience -- one of our all-time favorite restaurants in Singapore!,"We've been exploring the Singapore restaurant scene for 1.5 years now (everything from $1.50 hawker plates to 3-star Michelin venues), and we just keep coming back to Chef's Table again and again. The food is exquisite, the servings are well-paced and nicely sized, and it's always such a fun surprise to see what Chef Stephan and his team will make based on the seasonal ingredients that are available. We love the simplicity of ordering -- are there any ingredients you don't want in your dishes, how many courses, and do you want a wine pairing (if so how many glasses). Then you can simply sit back and enjoy! The wine pours are generous by Singapore standards (they make us feel like we're living in Europe again), the wine list has some really lovely bottles that we haven't been able to find anywhere else in Singapore, the wine tasting menus are very creative, and we were so pleasantly surprised that the sommelier remembered us (and our favorite wines) between our first and second visits, even though they were 4 months apart. That brings me to the staff -- everyone in the restaurant is extremely friendly, the waiters and sommelier are very knowledgeable yet also easy and fun to chat with, and the service is outstanding. When we last had dinner there on my husband's birthday, they even served us a delicious, complimentary special dessert for the occasion (and the dessert was fantastic -- much better than other birthday cakes we were charged extra for at other restaurants). In short, I cannot find a single thing to criticize about Chefs Table, and although there are so many other places still to try in Singapore, I know that we will be back here every few months because it is absolutely delightful."
"Delicious Food, excellent wine selection","Had a date night with hubby here. I had 4 course while hubby had the 6 course degustation menu. We also took up 4 wines pairing by the restaurant's sommelier.

Every course were done perfectly, they were so delicious that I licked the plates clean.

Wines were well selected, the two whites and reds were not run-of-the-mill Chardonnay/cabernets. I applaud the sommelier for taking the effort to procure these wines.

I have planned another visit to this lovely restaurant. Ladies will have to be mindful on their choice of clothing.Sitting on the high bar chair in a sexy little black dress would be a challenge."
Amazing Birthday Experience with Family!,Special Birthday celebration with my husband and Teen/Tween Kids at Chef's Table in November. It was amazing! We ordered the 8-course tasting menu -- all of us loved it. Chef Stephan and his warm and professional team took great care of us. Truly one of the best dining experiences since moving to Singapore in 2019. Highly recommended. We already have follow-up reservations...it is that good!
Awesome fine dining experience!,"Luv this unique fine dining experience since we don‚Äôt choose our dish from the menu, instead we let the chef know the food that we don‚Äôt eat, really enjoy the food & surprises for each course! I truly appreciate the effort that the chefs have put in every courses, from preparation of the ingredients to the decoration of each dishes! I will definitely come back again! Surely recommend this place to my frens!"
Superb personalised dining,"Had a really excellent dinner at Chef‚Äôs Table. The degustation menu with a twist makes dining here a truly personalised experience. The food was quite exceptional, bringing together perfectly cooked and expertly presented exquisite ingredients. Every one of the six courses was first class and we thoroughly enjoyed each mouthful. Credit to the Chef, and also to the staff for their attentiveness and service. Only downside was a noisy group who at times drowned out all conversation - unfortunate, but it didn‚Äôt spoil our evening. Highly recommended to those looking for a unique dining experience. We will definitely return and look forward to learning more about the Chef‚Äôs philosophy."
"Food is good, but oh.. the service is impeccable!","Good food brings people back, but great service will make me a long time customer going forward. Kudos to the entire team at Chef's Table that made this experience such a wonderful one.

The food is good, especially the seafood etc... but the meats can still be worked on...

No complains here, and definitely made an impression!"
Deserve Michelin,"This is the third time we celebrate our wedding anniversary at Chef's Table because we know we will have the WOW factor, and it is true. Each time we visit Chef's Table, it is an experience and always learning something new. Whenever we have visitors in town, we go for the safe bet - Chef's Table. Keep up the excellent, no, consistently excellent work guys! Chef Stefane has got to be one of my favourite chefs in SG. Always innovative, excellent food quality, immaculate presentation, without breaking the bank.

Their staff is really hospitable, warm and sensitive,"
Interesting concept though amount of food is rather small,"The concept is interesting in that the cooking area is an open area visible to the customers, and different chefs came to our table to introduce their dishes, including a young Singaporean chef who had studied at CIA (Culinary Institute of America). Food wise, it was Omikase, depending on ingredients available, and you can choose from 4, 6 or 8 courses - and you can have different combinations at the same table. I liked the first dish which had an interesting blend of flavours and textures, including fish roe (in the picture attached). However, the rest of the dishes to me were less memorable. One issue, especially for big eaters, is the amount of food. I am a small eater and I chose the 6 course option. There was hardly any carbo in the 6 courses, save for a ring of mashed potato. I was not full, but OK. However, I can imagine someone who is a big eater feeling hungry at the end of the course. My husband and friend had the 8 course, and my husband could eat more after the meal. I think this was mainly because unlike restaurants which serve bread, this restaurant did not. Another issue is the mineral water. I did not realise when the waiter asked if I wanted water that he was serving sparkling water. It would have been good to alert the customer. I do not like mineral water, whether sparkling or still. Would have preferred iced water, which they served my husband because he asked for it - but I didn't realise there was a difference, and didn't want to be troublesome by asking for a change after the water was served."
"Excellent, have been there for dine in and takeout","Tried their takeout menu during covid lockdown, very much value for quality and taste. Went back after reopening to try, maintained their standards. Especially love the seafood, my bf likes the meats although it‚Äôs a bit too savory for me. Good wine pairing menu. Omakase style, so no need to think about what‚Äôs on the menu. Just tell them what you don‚Äôt eat out of the ingredients that they present to u, though I still get some ingredients not on the menu which I don‚Äôt like eg asparagus and celery which I transferred promptly out of the plate. 4 course menu great for a lady, 6 course for a guy, and 8 to be completely sure of satiety."
A must do in Singapore!,"It's my first review ever on TripAdvisor but I truly think that they deserve to have some good feedback. The food was elaborated and sophisticated, the crew was super nice and the atmosphere in this rather small restaurant is lovely. The experience is really amazing even though Chef Stephan himself wasn't around on that specific evening.
The vibe in the restaurant between the crew is also very healthy and good which is important. You feel relaxed when you eat over there. Maybe a little bit disappointed by two wines among the wine pairing as they weren't really on the same level as the food. But I'm quite picky on Wine as well.

Overall an amazing experience. Thanks for this very good moment team Chef's Table!

Nathan."
Lovely experience,We had a 4 course and wine pairing set dinner. I am very picky with my wine but the wine options were well picked and it accentuate the food flavors. Price point is very reasonable. Would definitely go back again.
Excellent service and food,We went last week for the Friday lunch set menu and it was fantastic! Food was delicious and the service was top notch. Very friendly staff and very attentive.
Great food and service,We tried Chef's Table twice and found the service excellent and the food innovative and unique. Enjoyed the evening immensely and will return again.
Excellent food & excellent service,We went to Chef‚Äôs Table with another couple and opted for the 6 course wine pairing menu. Our friend had some specific dietary requirements but the Chef was very accommodating & created a personalised menu for her. The food was exquisite and the sommelier chose some excellent wines to compliment our dinner. The staff are very friendly & were extremely knowledgeable about the food and wine. It was a very special dining experience and I would thoroughly recommend Chef‚Äôs Table for a special occasion.
Interesting Western ‚ÄúOmakase‚Äù experience,"My friends and I really enjoyed dinner at Chef‚Äôs Table by Chef Stephan - thoughtful food pairings, interesting cooking techniques and beautiful plates. Expect a delightful ‚ÄúWestern Omakase‚Äù experience, curated from the list of fresh produce, so it‚Äôs a surprise every time. I would definitely go straight for 8 courses instead of 6 the next time!"
Had an excellent dining experience,Had an excellent dining experience here. Went for the 6 course menu and was satisfied with each and every course served. Will definitely be back for more. Thanks!
Excellent once again,"Had a surprised birthday dinner there arranged by friends in March before the Covid lockdown happened and was swept away by the amazing food , great wine and accomodating services. The sommelier and waiters are very friendly and funny making it a joyous occasion for my birthday. I was impressed by the little details they added to make it a special birthday celebration for me. Our table has quite a list of food limitation due to different religions but they were all thoughtfully catered to.

We went back again last weekend. Just my husband and me for a rare romantic dinner. The chef delivered once again with beautiful food and service. We like the personal introduction of dishes by the chefs involved.
Thank you for another wonderful night!"
Exquisite and solid,"Have ordered extensively during the circuit breaker period, when they were doing a very compelling take-away warm-up-at-home concept, which worked out brilliantly. At the time it was 2 x 3 courses for 2 people at a SGD180+. So $45+ per person per day for a 3-course meal.

Yesterday, I had lunch there after a long absence from dining-in, and it was an utterly enjoyable experience. The atmosphere was confident yet relaxed, basically one felt that Chef Stephan knows exactly what he is doing and what he likes, and that he lets you share his space and food with him. No hang-ups here about what diners should look like or how they should be - come as you are, and as long as you are polite and courteous, you will be treated like a good friend.

Now for the food: We have a 4-course lunch that started with a Hamachi (Yellowtail) sashimi, followed by a chicken risotto, then came a wagyu + beef rib combo for my friends and a salmon with Jerusalem artichokes for me, finished by a sublime combination of red velvet cake with mascarpone, pomelo and a few other bits and bops. Whilst all the dished were excellent, thoughtfully put together and beautifully presented, Chef's pastry dishes always stand out for me - perhaps unsurprisingly for an Austrian chef, but really, if you like your desserts, you will feel right at home here. At SGD58++ a real steal (Especially since it also includes a good coffee or tea at the end)."
We had dinner at this place,"We had dinner at this place with our teenage daughters. The food was excellent, every dish was different and the wine pairings were nice too. They also had vegetarian options. Staff are fantastic and the service was really nice. Highly recommended for a celebration meal."
Innovative and delicious dinner,"Chef's Table puts together some of the most creative dishes I've seen. Their menu is based around choosing ingredients that you like and crafting something bespoke that creatively includes them. My wife and I really loved the concept and how the entire approach was focused on evolution, change, and not serving the same dish twice. Special mention to the Foie gras which was brilliant, and that's coming from a person who doesn't usually like it. It wasn't just the food that we loved, the service was great with the staff being extremely attentive. I challenged myself to finish my glass of water before anyone could refill it but failed repeatedly.

I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Chef's Table and I highly recommend a visit."
Stunning and very yummy food,"It was a great experience! I had a vegan dinner, and my partner got a meat-based one. Each dish was beautiful, and the taste was wow! The only pity was that they didn't ask us about our cheese preference which meant we didn't eat 2 of the 4 :/
We went for the 4 dishes option, and it was just enough."
gourmet cuisine in a relaxed setting,"After enjoying Stephan's gourmet food delivered at home during the circuit breaker, we finally made it back to the restaurant in person... bustling with people, we were glad to see the restaurant is popular as it was before Covid-19... they really deserve it!
Amazing food at a reasonable price,,, even more surprised that the kitchen crew pulled off an absolutelt perfect and stunning 8-course meal even without Chef Stephan... kudos to all the crew behind the stoves, but also the lovely waiters. we'll be back soon for sure!"
Amazing,"We had an amazing birthday celebration dinner at Chef's Table on 7 August, 2020.

The wonderful journey has started from reservation stage, staff paid great attention to every detail of our preference and dietary requirements.

We took the 8-course set dinner, every dish came with pleasant surprise.

Special thanks to wine sommelier who gave us fantastic recommendation for our champagne, wine and digestive wine.

We are extremely amazed by the excellent service and teamwork at the restaurant, on such a busy Friday evening, flow of courses goes very smoothly for every table, drinks are consistently topped up. We feel the passion of all the staff, it naturally cheer up diners at the restaurant.

We'll certainly come back soon."
Wow!,"What can I say, the food is so good I don't know where to start. We've 6 Course Meal, I can't fault any of it. The taste, flavor, presentation by chef surpass all the resto I've been visiting. The wine by the glass selection though just 4 whites. All are very good. We'd a glass of red wine to finish the meal. I had Pinor Noir and partner had Melot, so yummy! Cocktails Summer Passion and Twisted Rosemary are unimpressive, we could have skip it.

The food and price are 6 star yet strangely their ambience is like a Bistro. Restroom is not particular clean. 2 restroom total and 1 of them I find it hard to open the door after latching. I thought I was going to be trapped in the restroom!!

I hope they consider changing their high chair seats. Is not comfortable and I can't consider bringing my elderly friends here.

Our server Ricky is very attentive and pleasant. 5 star for a great evening!"
Excellent Meal!!,"Food was excellent and interesting in taste, beautifully presented with friendly service. Chef Stephan came round to explain the fresh ingredients he used in the menu. Every course is a delight.
It was a very enjoyable lunch for the whole family. Thank you!!"
Great food and attentive service! :),"Enjoyed ourselves and I can‚Äôt believe I walked past this place so many times yet did not try it before.
Food quality was amazing, I especially love the porcini mushroom risotto and the hamachi with grade fruit sauce which has an interesting twist. Thanks again Chef‚Äôs Table for having us and may I wish you all the best! Oh, and lovely ambience!"
