ADK team building lunch,Food was yummy yummy. Prawn curry was really nice.Had a good time bonding with my colleagues. The Naan was nice.
Totally delicious!,"Moist Brown chicken tandoori (no artificial coloring), love the presentation of prawn curry in the coconut, happy place!"
Not as good as it was,We've been here twice before on our way back home to Aus and loved it. This time however we were very disappointed. The quality of the food was not to the very high standard we've previously enjoyed. My wife noticed our order sitting on the counter going cold before it came to us. Service wasn't great either.
"Wonderful food, warm friendly service in cosy restaurant. Must visit.","Fantastic Bengali dishes beautifully cooked. Wonderful complex flavours. Chef skillfully uses the palate of spices to produce excellent dishes.
Great advice to guide you through the more unusual Bengali and Punjabi dishes which are very special.
Lovely cosy room enhances the special experience.
We will visit again and again."
Cannot speak more highly of this restaurant!,Fabulous cuisine and service. Loved our night here : I like the way to order a few entrees and mains for us and we were seriously not disappointed. I cannot speak more highly of this place.. we BYO’ed a nice bottle of red and this exquisite dinner was only $120!
Truly from Bengal,"Did a takeaway to celebrate the birthday dinner of my friend , who comes from Calcutta

Right from ordering (Meera on the phone was attentive with great advice ) to picking me up the order , the whole experience was outstanding

Maacher Paturi, Kosha Mangsho and Amer Chutney . The feedback given by my friends on these dishes as I am a vegetarian was simply outstanding and a BIG THUMBS UP !!!!"
Pretty satisfying indian cuisine although portions are not always consistent.,"We often opt to get our orders delivered. On good days, Mustard is generous with their portions but on bad days, the delays and reduced portions can be frustrating. Wish they would just stick to some consistency... of being generous:)

Apart from the issue above, this place serves tasty, delicious, unpretentious grub. They're big on taste here so move along if you're watching your salt and oil intake. It's the very reason we like what they whip up most times.

We find their signature punjabi dishes rather too spicy but once you know that, either steer clear or dive in and brace yourself. The dals are rather too watery too.

Our pet faves are their lamb and prawn curries. Can't go wrong there. Prepare a good portion of rice, prata or noodles at home and you're all set.

Just know that breads don't pack and travel well. Best to eat at the restaurant itself."
When Indian food is on your mind…,Great experience… food is delicious! We tried a few times and most times we ask the waiter for recommendations just telling them the type of meat/spice we look for! Always great suggestions!
Twice a week at Mustard makes Singapore life happy!,"In my mother's village, you could stop by any home and they would serve you delicious home-cooked food. Those times are gone, but Mustard is still here. Dishes that I never found anywhere in the world, and the joyful warmth of service makes me feel I am back at my mother's village home. I tried every Indian restaurant in Singapore, Mustard is #1 in food, service and value. Food you can be thankful of receiving twice a week!"
The best Indian in Singapore!!,The best Indian in Singapore!! Small quaint family fun restaurant! Service is amazing and the food is Devine. The quality of food has been consistent over the last 10 years (this says something for singapore) consider it a crime if you have not been!!
Surprising Enjoyable Dinner,"My friend invited me & another friend to dine in Mustard. It was my first visit trying punjabi & bengali cuisine.
We ordered
#1 Onion Bhajia
#2 Damodar Chingri (cocont prawn curry)
#3 Kadhai Paneer (cottage cheese)
#4 Bhindi Masala (lady finger)
#5 Kosha Mangsho (boneless mutton)
#6 Begun Bhaja (pan fried egg plant)
#7 Naan
#8 Mango Lassi

Due to my vegetarian diet, i had enjoyed the above vegetarian dishes as it was pretty authentic with balance flavor.
However the egg plant was a bit oily & did not have the crispy texture.
My friends have enjoyed #2 & #5.
The prawn curry is Mustard's signature dish & crowd favourite.
The mango lassis was intense with milk & yougurt flavor.

The restaurant was rather small & it is recommended to make reservation in advance.

I would like to visit again for other vegetarian dishes.

Regards

SINGAPORE"
Awesome Awesome,"This restaurant is something of its kind
Chef Bijay is one of the most accommodating Chefs I have come across.
The mustard Chicken is amazing coupled with the Achari Chicken and don’t forget the Kosha Mangsho if you’re not a beef lover Chef can make a Chicken Mangsho
The puris are like having a foodgasm it melts in your mouth with the the food
Having had a wholesome dinner we were done
But were surprised with a round of homemade kulfi and being so stuffed, my wife and I couldn’t get more of it after the first bite"
Good ambience and food!,"Mustard is good for any occasion! Birthday, anniversary, etc. We came here for our anniversary lunch after exploring the Mustafa Center in Little India. There are many busy restaurants nearby that also looked delicious and with long queues. So it was nice to have the reservation set at Mustard. The food was some of the best that we have tried."
Excellent Bengali food.,"The food was awesome, authentic Bengali fare and service was attentive and efficient. Highly recommended."
Well balanced flavours,"I had prawn in coconut gravy served in a coconut, mustard fish wrapped in banana leaf, jeera rice, salad and garlic naan. Flavours are so well balanced. Yes it's pricy but the food is of quality, service is amazing and ambience is cozy."
"Homely, cozy, warm and delicious food",The staff here are amazing. They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. The food is delicious... beyond words. It is owned by a lady and you can see it has a special touch. One of the very nice Indian boutique restaurants on Race Course Road.
Really good Indian meal,"Really good Indian meal. We came on a recommendation to try the ‘best Biryani in Singapore’ from a local friend and were delighted we did. Had a starter which was crispy whole spinach leaves in batter, followed by Lamb Biryani and a Dhal plus Pilau Rice. Washed down with a bottle of wine and iced water (tap water provided free). Really nice meal and great friendly service. Highly recommend a visit. And fun to walk around Little India afterwards."
Book ahead,"While a bit more expensive than it's neighbors, the high quality food here is worth it. You'll need to book ahead, even for lunch, as it's small and has been ""discovered"". And excellent family-owned restaurant."
Delicious!,"We brought our Indian friends from Switzerland to try the food in this restaurant since they are vegetarian, and we are not. This restaurant offers both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Our friends ordered the dishes since we're not familiar. The dishes were delicious and we enjoyed the food very much."
Garbage,Just utter garbage in the name of Kolkata food. Just doesn't represent Kolkata on a plate. Tries to be unnecessarily sophisticated and sacrifices what Kolkata looks on a plate. Also the price.....no words
Good dinner,"A must if you’re in the area. I’ve tried a couple of other places in the vicinity but this has go to be the one that stands out the most in terms of Punjabi and Bengali food. I’d highly recommend the coconut prawn curry and paneer(the prawn curry is probably the highlight).
The restaurant space is just about right, however, you need a reservation.
The service was great and the staff do help if you’re not sure about what you’d like to order."
OCC SGP review of Mustard,"The Oakham Curry Club (OCC) is a well-respected Institution with multiple international franchises. This review of Mustard being the latest by our Singapore branch
The OCC takes pride in searching out the finest Indian restaurants and providing impartial reviews of Curry Houses all over the world.
Members vote anonymously without being influenced by other members (we call this “no swaying”) on 5 categories, and an average score out of a maximum 10 is given to each restaurant we review.
On Friday 28th June 2019 – The OCC visited Mustard, Race Course Road
Before we get to the review, a brief introduction to Mustard which was prepared by our Chairman prior to the meet.

Mustard – That one crucial ingredient in the Indian spice treasury that ties the vibrant cuisines of the Eastern Indian State of Bengal and the Northern State of Punjab, yielding a rich and exciting harvest for the connoisseur’s palate.

We, at Mustard, celebrate the cuisines of two of India’s most culinarily advanced states, where passion for food is not just an ethnic identity, it is a way of life!
This pioneering concept executed by Ms. Radhika Abbi, a trained Chef herself, brings to Singapore’s food scene a plethora of authentic and unique dishes that have already attained ‘Comfort-Food’ status with regular clients and tourists, who enjoy Mustard’s warm, personalised service with a glass of wine or a pint of chilled Indian lager in a relaxed and cosy atmosphere

For full transparency, see below scores (out of 10). The voting is based on the votes from OCC members. Restaurants must score an average of 7/10 or above to receive the OCC sticker of recommendation. All OCC members have been through a rigorous selection process to gain entry into the Club. In short, we all know our curries.
Quality: 6.58
Customer care: 6.58
Value: 7.25
Service: 7.12
Atmosphere: 6.67

Overall: 6.84
Mustard IS NOT awarded the much-coveted OCC sticker of recommendation, narrowly missing the required 7/10 average

We ordered a mixed platter, grilled cottage cheese, onion bhaji, egg plant, sag aloo, prawn masala, yellow dahl, butter chicken, mutton vindaloo AND poppadoms – much to our dismay the mighty OCC we’re served BURNT poppadoms. This did not go down well with the curry connoisseur. The manager spotted this and apologized profusely before quickly removing them and replacing them very quickly – before hopefully scalding the kitchen for serving this travesty.

Poppadom gate over we moved onto starters, beers were flowing from the attentive waiting staff. The starters were a hit with the grilled cottage cheese a particular winner, however it seems the mains were the real let down of the night, the spice of the Mutton Vindaloo was terrible and the tastelessness of the prawn masala was a really poor show. Comments from the OCC members as follows: Some dishes were excellent but some were average, the prawn dish tasted of absolutely nothing. Having eaten here before I was expecting a much better showing. They should be embarrassed to call that a vindaloo…..

Also being jam packed into such a small venue was also a problem for the portly OCC crew, the acoustics for the speeches were terrible, which made actually hearing the speeches incredibly difficult.

Personally I am a little disappointed that Mustard didn’t quite cut the mustard as it has the potential to be a really great curry house. Unfortunately, the mains and restaurant space were its real let down.

"Fantastic food, wide choice","Fantastic food, wide choice of menu and everything is cooked fresh - restaurant is spotless and staff are welcoming and efficient - definitely would recommended efficiendefinitely would recommend a visit"
Dinner,Excellent food. No complaints there. Waiting staff were a bit slow but the place is understaffed. Fantastic food. Highly recommended
A true gem on Racecourse Rd,"Firstly, locals and tourists have plenty of choice on this busy street. There are many more, bigger and more 'upmarket' places to eat. But Mustard offers something different and more intimate. You can taste the love in their food. The secret, of course, is knowing what to select that will excite and also satisfy you. I'm fortunate to have eaten some wonderful food from the Indian sub-continent, so navigating a menu is less of a problem. Mustard has a simple and uncomplicated menu. But one thing is clear.... Everything is good! We adored sharing their butter chicken, a stunning dish using succulent breat of chicken in a subtle, rich and fragrant sauce. Take the plain Basmati rice to compliment it. For me, I love a Peshawari Naan with coconut and sweet candied fruits in a wonderfully, light Naan. Alongside the roasted cauliflower was amazing in its own blend of Masala. Not overpowering in any way. Simply served at Mustard with courtesy and humble thanks."
"Great Food, no preservatives, hospitable too","Really liked the dishes we ordered, my family enjoyed the fish with mustard (came wrapped in a banana leaf), the desserts were great as well.

Learnt that they don’t use preservatives etc, no MSG too.

Keep up the hospitality and food quality, will certainly visit again."
Mustard ... It is okay kind of lunch for family with kids,"We have been there 2 times, once as office colleagues and once with family. Specifically, non-veg food is above average, not that kind of awesome. But yes, if I am comparing with other Indian restaurant, it is in top 10%. One point I want to mention here, that it is always better to book the table and then proceed. Because we had booked that day luckily, just after we reach, there was a couple waiting for their round, but that time, they just say no to them. So better to book the table.
LOcation wise it is very convenient from Little India MRT station. Ambience is okay and not that flashy.
I had lot of expectation from their fish item, but that was not that great. But yes, chicken tandoori was good.
Service is good, folks provide you few things which you ask them to serve. Overall it was a okay experience."
Outstanding,"Awesome experience, looking forward to when I return. Friendly staff. A full restaurant always tells a story."
Best Bengali Cuisine,"The restaurant is super small, but the interior is awesome and the pricing is bit on the higher side. The service staffs are very friendly, even during their busy hours. They have a bar."
Good Indian food,"The dish with shrimps inside the coconut is awesome and we really enjoyed it! I couldn’t stop eating it!
Also the rice was very good, just a little bit spicier than what I’m used to eat so it was difficult to finish everything.
If you are European like me: never trust when they say “it’s just a little bit spicy” because it’s vulcano level spiciness :)"
Amazing Indian food ...A culinary gem,"Our family has been going to Mustard for 4-5 years. Recently, we came across a review by the Oakham Curry Club (OCC) about the place, and we were shocked to read that contrary to what we would expect, Mustard didn't quite make the cut (their cut of a score of 7). We decided to re-check the place out for ourselves, and we are happy to say that the food is as excellent as it ever has been, and the service quality was their usual top notch standard. We tried the following - Kalibari Chop, Egg-Mutton Roll, Sorse Macch, Paneer tikka, and as always we were utterly satisfied.

The Internet of things has given rise to many a armchair expert, who have very little understanding of what Indian food is. Reviewers of such ilk give their sage advice, and thus rob people an opportunity of a good culinary experience, especially those who have never tried it before.

Don't pay much attention to what OCC has said. Mustard has always been a tremendous experience. You won't be disappointed."
Very good quality Indian restaurant,"We’re glad we chose to eat here. The food was of a very good quality and tasty and the service was very good too. Back home there is a perception that Indian cuisine has to be very spicy hot, so it’s refreshing to see a restaurant not succumb to such stereotypes and stay true to authentic Indian cuisine. Our 8 year old enjoyed eating here, especially the puri and the Kastoori Kabab, a chicken dish marinated in cheese and fenugreek. I really enjoyed my lamb chops, called Masale waliyan Chaampan as well as samosas for my starter."
Cozy place,"We went for lunch with family and kid. Place is centrally located but small. Food was ok. It's a Bengali restaurant and one of the dishes had lots of mustard in it. The desert we ordered, phirni, could have been better. Service was good."
"MUSTARD- A MUST VISIT IN LITTLE INDIA, SINGAPORE","We went there for dinner on 20th June 2019. We booked the table in advance and had no problem in getting immediately seated. We were served our choice of food very fast on placement of order. The Fish finger was a good choice of my grandson and we all enjoyed it with Biryani.

Hope to visit again"
Reliable as ever!,"Mustard is one of our favourite Indian Restaurants in Little India. It turned out ‘reliable as ever’ this Sunday morning as we decided to visit for lunch. Our lunch order included Paneer Tikka as starters, followed by Malai Kofta, Bhendi Masala, Baingan with Parathas, Garlic Naan & Roomali Rotis. Our drink order was the incomparable Alphonso Mango Lassi. A good weekend meal, all round!"
Delicious freshly made food,We had a family lunch here with a small baby. We were made very welcome. The menu is extensive and dishes are very tasty and carefully cooked. The problem is that we all ate far too much and wanted to try more. Service is attentive and efficient. The restaurant has a good atmosphere.
Quality gone bad,"Biryani looked liked scrapped from bottom. Aloo Bhaja and loochi was served stone cold. Absolutely unapologetic behaviour even though the feedback was provided on the spot.

Will not go back again."
Lunch at Mustard,"Best authentic Bengali food restaurant in the whole world. Coming from a Bengali.
They have the most authentic bengali dishes which are very hard to find like Dab Chingri and Bhetki Pathuri."
"The real ""mild"" for spicy","We like Indian food, but unfortunately, can't do with much ""spicy"" food...so you are wondering ... let me tell you that this place its just perfect for this combo! Awesome flavors and mils spicy for western paladar...
the places is small ans not super fancy but we went for the food...book in advance..."
Terrible Service and food,"I was quite excited to try this place as some people visiting from India contended that the food here was very “authentic”. That intrigued me and I decided to take some local friends out who wanted to try authentic Indian food.

But oh was I disappointed. We went during our lunch break after making a table reservation. It took them 45 minutes to being our order !! That’s not what I expected during lunch hour but still reserved judgement.

And then the food that came out was all completely wrong. The tastes were bland or designed to ape some culture I couldn’t relate to. It was terrible in taste and I truly regretted having made that choice without trying it myself. I found the curries totally wrong and the dishes more average than any restaurant I’ve been to. To top it all, the server was rude.

Moreover the tagline of this restaurant is that food is cooked in mustard oil. But it didn’t taste like that, and it was not worth the visit whatsoever.

Not a place you want to visit if you know your Indian food..."
Authentic Indian nasi bryani,"I visited the famous Mustard Indian restaurant at Race Course Road this afternoon for lunch., Take a train on the Purple Line or Blue Line and alight at Little India MRT station. Exit at Race Course Road and walk for about 10 m and you will reach Mustard.

The restaurant is not very big and can seat at most 20 customers. The service is very slow and you must be prepared to wait for your food. However the quality of food is very good. The nasi bryani with chicken and mutton is excellent but the only drawback is that they do not provide free vegetables. You have to pay extra for any vegetable. The place is clean and the boss is quite courteous. The price is double what you pay at the hawkers' centre at Tekka food centre which is just 20 m away. Anyway you will get value for your money."
Probably the best mid-range Indian dining in Singapore,"Excellent food, including Bengali dishes. North Indian is superb too. Don’t go on a weekend without an appointment. Would also take my family on a good occasion, or whenever we need fool-proof good quality food and service. A must try!"
Ok food and clean restaurant,"The food is good, not outstanding but ok. We had better Indian food before. We ate here 2 times, but last time the appetizer they recomended (Kolkata roll with lamb) was not eatable :/ The price you pay for the food at this restaurant is not fair."
Must try their malai chingri,"Their Malai Chingri (prawn in creamy curry inside a coconut) stole the show - you can just go there for this one dish. They have a spicier version too. My father (a Bengali) felt that their Sarson Bata Jhol (mustard fish curry) wasn't authentic. Besides that though, overall, the food was very good.

Ambiance is not great - it's a small, cramped restaurant. But service made up for it.

In terms of value, I think it was a bit pricey given the kind of restaurant it is."
The best Indian meal I ever had,I had a coconut prawn dish and it was amazing! I really love the place and would take all vistitors in Singapore to eat at this amazing place!
Mustard is must-go!,"When food served is delicious, wholesome, authentic and prepared with care, it has got be a rare find these days!

We did not reserve a table, so had to wait about half an hour for a seat. Though space is a bit cramped inside, we were comfortably seated.

There are plenty of vegetarian options, so we are going there again and again over the next few months! Menu has many bengali names and sound mouth-watering!

If you are in Singapore, you must go!"
Bengali food in Singapore,"Great place for bengali food. We had the koroishuti kochuri - bread stuffed with peas, the shingara - which is the bengali samosa filled with cauliflower and peanurs to start off.. both dishes were great, reminded me of home, though the bread could have done with more filling. For mains we got luchi - puffy flour bread and malai chingri - prawns in a rich coconut gravy served in a coconut, and was totally the star of the show! Recommended if you want to taste Bengali food, the Punjabi food is average here and there are better places around for that."
Great spot to try Bengal food,"This is a small, casual restaurant in little India that specializes in Bengal cuisine. Get's crowded so call to book - we called same evng and were lucky to get a table (outside, all that was left). Service is fast and pretty good, food was excellent. Helped us order and adjusted level of spice (hotter) to our taste which was great. Have selection of beers, decent salty-lime soda. Overall a legit place, worth a visit."
Great little restaurant,"I have been here a few times and the food quality and service is consistently very good. I am not usually a mutton fan (often times it can be to gamey or undercooked) but their mutton curry is fantastic. They also have one of the best coconut prawn currries I’ve ever had, which is served in an adorable little coconut. The Apam is a delight! If you’ve never had it before, it is a light, gluten free, rice-based “pancake” with a light sour-dough tang. It is served with coconut milk and colored sugar for dipping. All around Mustard is a great place for a date or small group of friends."
Great experience,"The restaurant is located near the MRT Little India, very convenient. It's small but the food and service are excellent. I recommend to make reservation."
"review of mustard restaurant, singapore",My wife and I ate here recently and absolutely loved it. This was the best Indian food we have ever eaten! Everything was excellent! I just wish we could have eaten more or had time to go back for round 2.
Family dinner,"We went to Mustard on 28 th September 2018 , a family of six from Australia , we had a lovely meal , everyone enjoyed it so much , we did have to sit outside as inside was packed but that was fine , would recommend"
Dinner,Definitely one of the better Indian Restaurant in Singapore in Little Indian. Never disappointing every time we are here. The usual butter chicken chicken tikka fish curry and vegetable dishes are always good as can be.
Dinner,"Would highly recommend this restaurant. They don’t use food colouring or addictive flavouring (MSG) in their food, unlike so many of the restaurants in little india, and their food is simply to die for! If you’re looking for a healthier option, this is the best choice for you. Don’t miss out on the mutton curry (Kosha Mangsho) and the Prawn curry! And try their cheese naan or their rare Bengali desserts if you’re really looking to indulge yourself."
Make reservation,"Otherwise, you’ll not get a table on a Saturday night. We saw so many being turned away.

Mustard is now to be one of the top 3 restaurant along Race Course Road. The food was so good that we had forgotten to take more pictures.

The staff were responsive but not intrusive. They also give good recommendation. We waited a while for the food to be served and it was OK. When they were served it was good. So were the breads."
SVP Bank,"The worst restaurant in Singapore and extreme unprofessional. You travel this place to taste Bengali food. Even they have many empty chairs in the restaurant, they will tell you all seats are reserved. This happened 3 times when I walked to the restaurant just at the opening time as well. When you call them to make an advance reservation, they make you wait long hours on phone and then they say you require to come there to get a place."
A fortuitous chance encounter,"Was looking for a good place to eat along Race Course road and we chanced upon this place.

It had such good reviews pasted on the window and we thought why not we give it a go.

All I can say is YUMMALICIOUS!!

One thing to note - they don’t have Coke. Only Coke Light.
But hey, if you’re in an Indian restaurant, why in the world would you want Coke anyway??"
Good Price & Good Food,Expensive compared to other local restaurants in the neighbohood but whort it Make to reserve a table before getting there !
very very good,"Went to mustard after a gap and the food was excellent once again. We chose Bengali dishes - mustard fish curry, egg cooked in spices, and lentil cakes with gravy. All the dishes were delicious. Indian breads were also prepared nicely, especially liked the missi rotis.
Mustard stands out from the crowd of Indian restaurants on Race Course road. Will go back soon!"
Quiet Place,"Located in Little India Enclave of mainly South Indian population. Well known & popular for Indian style of food.
Quality is reasonably good and not very expensive. Though a small place with limited acco one has to be in Q particularly on weekends.
Service is really prompt and courteous. For change one may visit the place for a sumptuous Lunch or Dinner."
Found this Bengali and Punjabi restaurant in Little India after busy day sightseeing.,"We were tired and hungry. Small restaurant which was busy with locals which is always a good sign later in the evening. We had butter chicken,biryani and dal which was delicious. Staff very friendly and efficient. We had no complaints."
Extremely slow service,"Whether you do take away or dine in, the service is extremely slow. On top of it Food Panda also picks up food from Mustard in a very small radius. Sad that a good restaurant is so pathetic in terms of service."
Average Bengali food,The service was very nice and the fishes were fresh and tasty but the curry taste was average. The price is on the higher side. The highlight of the visit was deserts. We both enjoyed the shahi tukda and pati shapta. We may visit next time only for the sweet ending.
Just Awesome,"The best Bengali Indian cuisine I have had so far , the kosha mangsho (mutton) is amazing so is the cholar daal.
Eggplant bhaja is delicious and naan breads are supremely soft .
The only drawback is , if you plan to visit this place take a lot of time with you as the food generally takes upto 1 hour to be served.
This place is small with few tables only so it’s advisable to make a reservation in advance.
We waited for 1 hr after giving order. But it was worth waiting.
Must try place."
Expensive,"Small and quaint restaurant with a nice ambience and friendly staff. Food and drinks are quite expensive and portions are very small. Long wait for food as they claim to cook-to-order. Ok for a first visit to try Bengali/Punjabi cuisine but probably won't be going back unless the portion sizes are increased, at least."
"‘Father, mother and daughter evening’","Visited with my wife and daughter. Lovely welcome, food superb, what more can you say. The coconut and shrimp curry was beautiful. We had an assortment of curries and they all complimented each other. A few blades of Tiger beer rounded the evening off. Will certainly return when next in Singapore. Bathroom facilities, very clean, always a good sign in a restaurant."
Wonderful Bengali food,"The Bengali food at this restaurant was quite good. The prawn curry in a coconut was very similar to what I ate when I visited Kolkata. The other two Bengali dishes we ate were also good. The staff were friendly. The only downside was that it took quite long for the food to come, like many restaurants in India. I guess it was maybe because they cooked the food from scratch and wanted to maintained the quality."
Dinner for 2,We loved our food. Highly recommend this restaurant. Mutton curry and coconut prawn curry were amazing.
Cuts the mustard,A little gem. Comfortably the best curry on Race Course Road. Small dining area so arrive late or early.
The best Indian food in town!,"I’m an Indian, and I’ve lived here for 20 years. Always went to the same old haunts for home cooking, decided to try this place out for a change. And boy am I glad I did!
The prawn curry is INCREDIBLE. As is their maacher (fish) cutlet with kashundi [think along the lines of breaded fish with mustard sauce that melts in your mouth quicker than butter].

They do an awesome saag and makki ki roti as well, and their kebabs are sinfully good. If you go, go with a group, so you have more items to try and can split the cost while you’re at it.

Also make sure you get a reservation; they were packed on a *weekday* for lunch. I can’t imagine what it would be like on a weekend!"
Punjabi Dishes,The food is good and they serve some Punjabi dishes too . Apart form North Indian they serve delicious Bengali food
Good North Indian Restaurant along Race course road,"Dined here with with my family and friends on a Saturday for lunch. Ordered chicken tikka masala, garlic naan, lemon juice and masala tea and coffee. Chicken tikka masala was pretty good. It was subtly spiced and creamy. Naan was aromatic and fluffy. Masala tea was pretty decent too. Service was pretty slow though."
Punjabi Pleasure in Little India,"Little India is becoming a favourite destination for me now in Singapore, but as always better to leave the locals to choose the best of many options. On this occasion, my colleague Raj suggested Mustard which is a Punjabi and Bengali specialist. The Murraya Chicken was excellent with boneless tender chicken with a spicy marinade and a great chilli kick. The “handkerchief” Roti was great too with the accompanying Mustard Gravy. Washed down with a super cold Kingfisher. The service was efficient and friendly."
Eat Here,"I wasn't a big fan of Indian restaurants in Singapore (of which there are many) until I ate here. The food is really fantastic. The various blends of spices they use are aromatic, exotic and deeply pleasurable for the senses rather than simply hot and spicy. The meats are tender and come from good cuts. Recommend reservations as this place is typically full. The service was attentive even though they had several large tables of business people. Mango lassie, lamb dishes, shrimp and the chicken tikka all were excellent. another plus is that it is very clean. Only drawback for me is that it was very loud."
Authentic Indian flavours,We went here for dinner on our last night in Singapore. The Indian spices and flavours greeted you as you walked in. The restaurant was very clean and the staff were very helpful when choosing dishes. I would recommend this restaurant for great night of good food. We went on Sunday night when Little India is quite busy. The restaurant had a steady stream of tourists and locals.
One of the best Curry’s had,"Just a random stumble into a restaurant but what a meal! I am a curry, or anything spicy, fan and that chicken was outstanding. SGD$17 very affordable. Friendly service, chilly aircon all was great."
Authentic Taste,"The A/C in the restaurant was a bit too cold for us so we sat outside. That aside, the service was fast and courteous and the food was excellent. Best city I’ve had outside of India."
one of the best i[ve tasted,"The owner told me that this is likely the only restaurant in the entire south east Asia that serves Bengal food. With much skepticism, I put the first taste of the coconut curry infused prawns and I'm immediately a convert. This is by far one of the best meals I have in Singapore, any cuisine included."
Punjabi “sarson” and Bengali mustard in the same place,"Where in the world would you ever get a marriage of the finest, authentic Punjabi cuisine with real, authentic Bengali. Nowhere else in the world but Singapore. Mustard specializes in serving both cuisines and you cannot go wrong- definitely order the Kosha mangaho (mutton cooked in its own juices) and the fish with sarse bata (ground mustard) and get the sarsoon ka saag (mustard seed spinach) and the tadka daal. You will not regret coming to this place. Service is phenomenal and the place gets packed with tourists and locals so be sure to book."
Excellent and extremely delectable Indian (Bengali) cuisine,"Ok so apart from the obvious profiteering by charging $25 corkage for one bottle of wine, I have to say this place is quite a gem. Obviously we opted to drink their pretty average offering served meagrely in quantities that would make your most parsimonious aunt blush.

We had the fish Tika, succulent and spicy. The spicy Dahl finished with cream, and the prawn masala served in a whole coconut were divine. I can’t remember the last time I had a curry in a restaurant, where you could savour all the complex spices that went into the finished product.

The naan we ordered appeared to have been heated up in the microwave, it definitely wasn’t fresh, it was hard and inedible, and they quickly, and without drama, removed the charge from the bill.

If this place just paid a bit more attention to detail it could be great...I am rating it four stars but it reallly deserves 3.5 for the poor bread, the mean wine serves, and the exorbitant corkage."
A new Favourite and the Best of Little India,"I live in Little India and have eaten my fair share of curries and prata roti. This place is superior to the rest.

We ordered fish tikka to begin with, which was succulent and served with a zesty coriander sauce.
For main course, their signature prawn masala curry and creamy dhal were magnificent. Creamy, fresh and full of spice. I can still taste the cumin!

The roti bread was a little disappointing as it was burnt and hard on the underside. Next time I would order rice rather than bread, or stick with just naan.

Altogether an excellent meal and I would go here again, above all other Indian restaurants in the area. A new firm favourite!"
Excellent food for a reasonable price,"The place is rather small, but it has a large number of option of either Bengali or Punjabi cuisine. I was there with 4 friends and everybody was pleased with the food (taste and appearance). I got a Bengali curry and it was delicious."
One of the best Indian in Singapore,"People who know Bengali and Punjabi cuisine well, know that Mustard is definitely at the top of the game. I have been going to this place for years now and it has been an absolute delight each time.

Their mustard fish is as authentic as it gets and is really really delicious with plain steamed rice.

You can also try some of the vegetarian options like fried egg plants or potatoes (called bhajas) or the okra.

Their mutton vindaloo is another winner. In fact I have a few friends from India who can’t wait to get this mutton every time they visit. Their koshe manghsha (mutton cooked in bengali style) is amazing too.

Service is lovely with attentive staff, who are happy to explain various dishes and share recommendations.

It is a rather cozy outfit and hard to get tables, so getting a reservation in advance is recommended.

Can’t recommend this place enough.. a must visit!"
Farewell lunch,"The ambience, silverware and deco was good.
Service was so & so, we had to wait one hour for food.
I ordered naan and aloo gobi, I was NOT informed that naan contained eggs, despite the emphasized that I am vegetarian, but the waiter took no notice of it. Until I wanted to order another naan, that when he advised all naan contains egg. Aloo gobi was not tasty at all, it was bland. Overall experience was not that fantastic, basically one is paying for the ambience and not the food."
Excellent food!,We had the boneless mutton dish which was excellent - the meat was tender and the thick gravy was extremely flavorful. The Chana dal with potato crisps was delicious as well. Good to have roomali rotis after a long time . It’s a small restaurant and tends to get a bit noisy . Will probably visit it again.
Must stop if in the area,"Great little boutique of a restaurant of the main drag in Little India. Only about 10 tables so plan accordingly for your visit.

Good menu with lots of selections to choose from, curries, tikka, and non-veg. Good quality ingredient and flavor.

I left full and satisfied!"
Exquisite taste of Indian food,"If you never visit Mustard restaurant, you probably miss up a lot on how fantastic are Indian food tasting. I have visited Mustard for years and they are getting very popular; needs to make advance booking. Mustard is an unusual restaurant compared with others because their menu are from Punjabi area from the Central of India. Because of that unique location they create the best of north and south combination. This restaurant also accepts alcohol tasting to compliment the food. White wine and rose are perfect combination."
Not at all a proper bengali restaurant.,We went there for bengali food which it claims to serve. But we were totally disapointed. Mustard Rui fish curry and mustard prawn curry both were not at all propet bengali preperation. It appeared only a punjabi restaurant. No bengali should visit this place.
Authentic sumptuous Bengali food,"Been there thrice now and can't get enough of their sizzling mustard curries! The Bengali cuisine is their highlight as there are lots of other places for Punjabi cuisine. Their chef is Bengali..and all their Bengali dishes be it fish, chicken or lamb, are awesome.
The friendly staff offer their insight if you ask for suggestions when ordering food. We really appreciated when the staff advised us that we were ordering too much food when we ordered their famous prawn curry, fish in mustard gravy AND a mutton dish.
Pros: Great food, excellent service, easily accessible
Cons: Small space, limited tables"
"Disappointing, better curry in hawker center","Ordered 3 different curries, they all seemed to have the same sauce (same colour and taste). We were also asked if we wanted it spicy, which we did. However none of the curries were spicy. I had a tastier curry the next day in a hawker center for a quarter of the price.
Service was also slow."
Delicious,"Great food with wonderful flavours, family friendly, ordered too many of their delicious garlic naans!!"
Good food & Nice service,Good food & nice service. smiling faces & helpful gestures ..!!One extra Star for the wonderful service ...!! Taste of food can be improved as food could not deliver as per expected ..!! Will visit again soon 👌👍
Good enough,"Unique blend of Punjabi and Bengali dishes on menu. The two starters we had could be improved. The Calcutta samosa advertised cauliflower but didn't find or taste any. The chicken egg rolls also failed to meet the Calcutta taste perhaps as both the egg and chicken quantity was less than desirable. However the main courses were good with the fish in banana leaf, paneer kadai, and dal. The puris were with as little oil as possible. So overall enjoyed it. They allow for 25 dollars a bottle to bring your own wine! Hurrah for that"
Left hungry,Clearly the chef has limited knowledge of bengali cuisine. The shorshe ilish (lish in mustard sauce) and the mutton kosha left a lot to be desired. The rice was too dry. And after you place the order the food takes more than 25 mins to arrive! Not going there again.
The best Indian restaurant on race course road,"I have tried them all or almost. That's my top one. Good service. Nice place. A nice menu, with a map of india that tells you more on what you eat.
It tast very good. I'll recommend anyone to go to that one first now.
Enjoy."
"Great Food, good service, over priced!","We had been to Mustard over for lunch. Food was fantastic. They serve a mix of punjabi and begali food.

Must say that I have not had a better Paneer Kadhai at any place in Singapore. Service was good and prompt.

I found the place to be overpriced. A bill of 105$ for 3 veggies, 7 rotis and a sweet dish is definitely pricey.

Overall happy, recommend to all to try this place atleast once."
Delicious Bengali Fare on offer!,"Just the place in Little India to visit for delicious Bengali cuisine! This place tends to be full up often. So make sure you've reservations in advance to not face disappointment! Once in, you'll find the host very accommodative and adjusting. We had a full table of six and when we felt cramped, they were accommodative enough to offer a change. What we ordered was purely Bengalifare of Aloo Dum,Doi Baingan, Dhokar Dalna along with Chana and Roomali Roti. Alphonso Mango Lassi was my drink. The food tasted great and very different/unique. All tables were taken last Sat evening I noticed by expats from Europe & the US, showcasing the international appeal of the fare! Several guests without reservations had to be turned back, while some even didn't mind taking the two tables seated roadside with no AC on that sweltering evening. So much for the popularity of the place!"
Awesome & Bengali!,Must go and eat their mustard fish! It's a sin to be in Singapore and not eat their food! It also has some Punjabi dishes like saraso ka sag (mustard leaves curry)
Rude and impolite,"We entered the restaurant at  6.45 pm and there were two other tables taken,first question in a very rude tone is so you have a reservation then when we say no he says, OK we'll give you a table but food will take  45 mins... Again in a very brusque n impolite tone. Now really, In which normal restaurant ( not a Michelin 5 star haute cuisine place) which has two tables full does  food  take 45 mins..it was almost as if he didn't want us there so we left.never going there again.."
"Really poor food, and overpriced","Disappointing experience overall. Table wasn't ready when we arrived so we had to wait.

Of the three dishes we ordered, two were very poor. One was in a watery sauce that only tasted of mustard. One had hard undercooked chick peas.

Manager was kind though, agreed the food was not good, and didn't charge us for those dishes.

So they handled it well, but still disappointing overall. Lots of competition in the area that is far cheaper and better."
