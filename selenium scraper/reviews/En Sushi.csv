Dining with a private room,"We booked a private room for a meeting for 7 pax. The room was great and private for conversations, and the food was AMAZING. One of my friends is a Japanese who is very particular about quality of her food and she loves what was served that day. The location was also good for us as it’s located in bugis near most of our offices and not far from MRT station."
Family dinner,Good service with good price. Best Japanese restaurant at bugis. Will come back and visit here again
"Excellent food, ok price and great service","Excellent food, great service. From the moment we arrived the staff were surprising us with Japanese delights. We especially recommend the Otoro👌"
Great experience. Will be back!,Delicious and fresh Japanese cuisine. Service was excellent. Will visit again. Tips: try the Fugu Mirin Boshi - can’t stop ordering more. The warm sake was lovely too.
Best Sushi restaurant!!!,"Best Sushi in Singapore!! Beautiful restaurant. The food is amazing, great menu. Everyone was warm and welcoming. Very helpful and informative on the menu. I had the privilege to meet the owner. He was very kind to customers and the staff. Highly recommend."
Fantastic Sushi & Sake in Singapore,"Great spot right in the core of the city !! The service and quality of the food was on point. And if you like great sake, this is the spot for you ! Ensushi could rival any sushi spot in Las Vegas"
Absolutely amazing! Great sushi and fantastic drinks!,"We couldn’t recommend a better place to go in the city! We walked from our hotel as its very centrally located and tried a little of everything!

We heavily recommend trying several appetizers as they are great portions and have fantastic - different variations on traditional dishes (salmon hamachi carpaccio was especially good) and then plenty of sushi, sashimi and don style.
Recommend the sashimi as the bang for buck is much higher!"
Japanese dinner,A place with good fresh Japanese food for a very reasonable price. The beef slice was my favourite and my wife enjoyed the food a lot to the point she ordered more after we finished our first orders. Will definitely come back again in the future.
Great food and service,"Food and ambience of the place was great, with attentive staff whose service was great. Was a great dining experience with good food."
A Delightful Dining Experience,"I had a really nice time celebration with big group at En Sushi. It was not only the food so delightful to everyone’s liking, but also the ambience which give tranquil and relaxing mood to everyone, with the very welcoming restaurant staff’s hospitality and passion in making customers happy. The function room in the restaurant provided privacy, spaciousness, and comforting for all of us. Many of us started the dining with cooling and soothing Cold Honey Yuzu drinks, Spicy Salmon Belly, Hotate Menkai Aburi and a few Chef’s recommended Uramaki. We continued our sumptuous meal with delicacies of En Sashimi, Salmon Takaki with Uni, a few sushi and hand rolls, Donburi, Hot Food, and many kinds of Yaki, with my favouite of which was the fabulous Hamachi Kama Yaki with both Yellow Tail Head and Collar hot plate. The delicacies of Ika Shio and Ika Terriyaki (grilled squid with salt/sweet) were also the items impressive. We wrapped up our scrumptious dinner course with delectably and uniquely invented Mochi ice-creams in variety of flavours. Overall, it was an awe-inspiring dining experience for both adults and children. I highly recommend this restaurant for any get-together for good food in nice atmosphere."
It was very tasty.,"I went to this place with friends and family for my birthday and it was good. I didn't really like the sashimi other than salmon, but that's probably just me."
"Quiet, peaceful restaurant with good sushi","Chirashi Don was very fresh, Salmon and unagi rolls were yummy. Grilled ika was slightly under-grilled and needed a bit more salt. Green tea was diluted and you get a tea bag in your cup..."
Food is fresh and flavourful! Great ambience too! Definitely visiting again,"Very delicious food and great ambience! They have private rooms that are good for cosy gatherings and also for business meetings.

only had a photo:) was too indulged in the good setting and food. Sashimi is fresh, grilled Salmon is cooked to perfection, don, yaki was good. The waitress recommended a good bottle of Sake to go with the food. In all, highly recommend! Will surely visit again."
Awesome Sushi in Town!,Really fresh sushi served and prompt service! Portion given was reasonable and is of value for money.
Great sushi in Singapore,"I was looking for an affordable, well rated sushi place, and I found it. It’s slightly on the high side of affordable but totally worth it. I got a salmon roll, spicy tuna hand roll, otoro sushi piece, and salmon belly appetizer. All fantastic! Would highly recommend."
En Sushi,The sushis were amazing. Really one of the best ones I have tasted. Highly recommend sushi from there.
Quality Japanese food with affordable prices!,First time here and overall it’s a great experience! The sashimi were fresh and beef steak is a must-order :)
Great Sushi,"We came in on a whim, and I am glad that we did. This is a great little spot and the Sushi was fantastic. Our group tried a bunch of different rolls and they were all great."
Korea & Malaysia families,"Foods are really amazing, lovely environment, great services from all the service crews and chef. Thank you for such a wonderful experience"
"High quality, very tasty",Best miso soup I ever had. Sashimi was also very tasty. Good selection of sake. Sake was a little expensive. Service staff was very polite.

En sushi,Awesome food and service from the staff Recommended Good ambiance Will will visit next time to try other food
En Sushi,"Delicious sushi, terrific service. Will definitely come back again with family and friends - a real gem"
Left without eating - terrible staff and service!,"My partner and I read the reviews and were looking forward to dinner here. On arrival the restaurant was very cold and we asked for some warm water whilst we were reading the menu. We were told they only served bottled water - and ""didn't have"" tap water. Clearly the restaurant has water!

We were about to order a lot of food and would have had a few beers as well, but the unwillingness to simply serve us a glass of warm water whilst reading the menu (and to help us warm up!) plus the surly / ""cannot"" attitude from the staff meant we left and took our money elsewhere. Singapore is a hot, sweaty place and people need lots of water! I don't understand restaurants who refuse to serve tap water. It's wasteful and not environmentally friendly to use bottled water and it wasn't like we were there and not going to spend a lot of money. Take your custom elsewhere where you'll be welcomed and receive better service."
Incredible place in a great part of town,En Sushi was incredible! We went 3 times during our recent trip to Singapore. The freshness was incredible. Highly recommend!
Great,"Great choice of food. Amazing environment. Fresh sashimi. Friendly staff, quick response and very attentive"

"Cozy, quiet and delicious",I was searching a Japanese restaurant that is less crowded and comes with delicious Jap food. En sushi was able to fulfill those requirements! I love the cozy environment that I can bring my girlfriendbto enjoy the dinner together and have a fruitful conversation. The sashimi and hamachi are fresh. The Amebi Karaage is the must-try !

Perfect Treat,"It was a fabulous dining experience from the get go. The menu offers a wide variety of quality choices. The sashimi was fresh and the beef steak was perfect.

Best casual Japanese restaurant in Singapore,"Being a Singaporean, food is always at the top of our lists and minds. As a country filled with a myriad of cultures and of course cuisines, food and rather good food is something we would queue hours for and make a trip to.

En Sushi is located conveniently near Bugis+, a well visited shopping mall in the central part of Singapore.

If you drive, there are ample public parking just across or if you’d like, you can park at the mall as well and just cross the road to reach En Sushi.

Arriving at En Sushi, you will be greeted by a nostalgic sense of travel as if you were visiting an eating place in Japan, going through a small walkway and up the wooden stairs to get to the restaurant.

Once in, you’ll be then greeted by a very comfortable yet modern Japanese setting and if I could say, it looks posh even.

Ordering the food from their impeccable menu, convering their house specials of starters like Pitan Tofu (Century egg tofu), egg uni (poached egg topped with uni) to must tries like their grilled fish head.

You’d only wish you could fit more food in!

Their menu is suitable for all ages and I’m pretty sure you’ll find their food impeccable!

Don’t just take my words for it, try it today!

When you want Japanese, eat En Sushi!"
Fresh and yummy,"Dinner with a friend. Didnt have a queue to our surprise. Food was served really quickly, yummy and very visually pleasing too!"
Nice place,Very friendly japanese stuff!! The food was also very delicious. I really recommend this restaurant.
Good,"Nice environment, the food is good and the price is reasonable. Overall the experience is very good. Definitely will visit again."
Great food and service!,"Saw good reviews online and it sure didn’t disappoint! Ordered the pitan tofu, sliced beef steak, ebi salmon aburi maki and En Premium Chirashi don to go with our sake (monthly hot sake and Yoshikubo Ippin). Everything was so good we ordered another soft-shell crab aburi salmon maki before having the tofu cheesecake (which was amazing!) to end the night. Thank you Kenneth for your hospitality and your staff for the good service. Will be back again! :)"
Business and Friends gathering,"Wide selection of sake. High quality and value Food selection is great, especially the appetisers. Hamachi fish head is a must try. Super fresh and delicious. Reserve early for private rooms if required. Highly recommended for business setting or night's out with friends!"

Everyone of us enjoyed ourselves and my friends who are there the first time said they definitely will return! So will I! This is not a paid review, if you don’t believe, please go and witness yourself! Don’t say bo jio!"
Wonderful dinner,"1st time having meal at En Sushi. Was surprised to see swordfish bowl of a few veriaty . It was very enjoyable and worthy of a price for meal like this. Having a delicious meal was pleasant. What's more respected is during this difficult time, they still upkeep their standards to serve the freshest raw ingredients to me. As I know that Japanese restaurants are having a hard time keeping up this standard. I believe that En Sushi will definitely stand stronger than ever after this episode of pandemic. I will definitely return for their business and recommend everyone to do so."
Awesome food that are value for money,"I am pretty much a foodie myself, since high school days I have been traveling around Singapore trying out new and highly anticipated restaurants or hawker food. This restaurant is by far the one that I will find myself visiting whenever I crave for some Japanese. There are some dishes I would highly recommend. The yellow tail fish head is very fresh and has a lot a lot a lot of meat, a very good sharing dish. Salmon/Yellow tail/Tuna belly sashimi are highly recommended if you feel like splurging a little *trust me you will not regret it. Raw cod sperm are really amazing if you are feeling adventurous *this is one of my favourite, you will get drunk by the taste even without a drop of alcohol. Seared raw scallops with mantaiko is sweet and savoury *for those who don’t normally eat raw sashimi and wanted to start somewhere this is for you. Well and for the matching drinks they have a white range for you to choose from beer to whiskey. I like warm sake with sashimi, at times I’ll match it with whiskey. When in doubt just ask the manager for recommendations, they are highly equipped with the knowledge to satisfy your fine taste. I have been there a couple of times, so far I have never been disappointed. Thumbs up."
Love the Food!,"Good Food, Good Service, Good Ambience and reasonable price! Will come back again for more! Love the fish especially. You shoud order that."

Good Service with Excellent Food,"Having to quarantine for 21 days, we were craving for sushi and chanced upon En Sushi which was nearby to our SHN hotel. We took a chance and it was a hit! The Chirashi Don was fresh and we simply love the rest of the items we ordered from them.
We highly recommend their ""Soft-shell Crab Salmon Aburi Uramaki"" . Will order again."
Fresh sushi delivery,Yummy fresh sushi delivered to your door step. The sashimi has ice packs to keep it fresh too. Will recommend to my other friends.
No dine in but still not disapponited,"En Sushi is where we go for comfort food, reasonable pricing and its hamachi kama! Yes, grilled hamachi is our must-have. The beef is another favourite and The Son who does not eat garlic loves the fried garlic that serves alongside the steak. Jan is great with her recommendations too. We cannot wait for reopening so the family can dine in again."
Takeaway Promo - Chirashi & Salmon Aburi Mentai Don,"Ordered their promo 1-for-1 takeaway Chirashi Don & Salmon Aburi Mentai Don. Excellent, totally worth it!!! Portion of the dons were also enough for a normal adult meal !!!"

Fresh and thick sliced sashimi 🍣😋,"My plan to eat out today to celebrate my boy’s 21st birthday was screwed by the “no dine in allowed” CV-19 rule. Thanks Kenneth and Ching from En Sushi (@ensushisg) for sending over these oishii delights. We were able to continue our celebration safely in the comfort of our home.

Check out their 1-FOR-1 Donburi deals section - 2 Donburi will be delivered for every single order of Donburi #好抵食"
Great!,"Nice ambiance. Attentive, pleasant service staff who attended to our every request. The food was delicious; I especially enjoyed the ika teriyaki and the ebi salmon aburi maki. The tofu cheesecake was good as well. Had a good time here and would definitely patronise again."
En Sushi,One of the better Japanese place in Singapore. Rarely we will see such a nice Japanese place with such affordable price.
Omakase 9-course,Had the 9-course Omakase. Was pleasantly impressed by how good and affordable it is. Will come back again next time
Omakase at en sushi,"I had the Omakase at En sushi and it was really good, it is worth the price and they even explained each dish that is served so we knew what we were going to eat. The service is prompt and the setting of the restaurant is very calming. I highly recommend this place!!!"
Great sushi delivery!,"I live overseas and wanted to send my father a Japanese dinner for his birthday. I found En Sushi online via TripAdvisor and Google reviews. Had questions about their menu so I contacted them via fb - and got a response quickly from Kenneth (the owner). He offered to substitute an item from a set menu due to dietary restrictions, which was appreciated. I told him it was for a milestone birthday and he reassured that he would deliver it personally. Ordering was a breeze, the food arrived on time, well packaged and chilled. My family raved about the dinner, my dad who hasn’t had sushi since Covid enjoyed his Chirashi very much. Perhaps his only gripe was he would have loved a little more wasabi on the side. Otherwise the food was delicious all around. Thank you En Sushi for making this easy for me!"
Good japanese food!,The food was delicious! I highly recommend the bara chirashi don as the sauce they used was something special. Sashimi is fresh too. The tofu cheesecake is also a must-try! Service was prompt. Will be back again.
