Thank you to maintain your quality through the years, you make people do happy for your Brittany corner in SG !
Bloavez Mad 2023 ! ( Happy New Year in Brittany)"
Best escargots not only crepes,It is best place of crepes and escargot. Trying 1-2 a month to visit the place. Having breakfast with escargot. I think it is best escargot in Singapore as well as crepes. My wife is crazy about crepes.
One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore,"Just love this place! The most delicious, freshly made authentic crepes. So yummy! This is a small family run business who care passionately for the customers and take pride in the quality of everything they serve.

Lovely service and setting in a great location. Top tip... Save room for dessert! Can't recommend this place highly enough!"
Best Crepes in Singapore.,"A little gem of a place in Singapore city.
Right beside Raffles, don’t miss out on these yummy crepes.
Friendly staff, quiet and comfortable.
Crepes were delicious - sweet and savoury. Something for everyone!
Great job Entre-nous. ❤️
Perfect for our family with 3 kids."
Crepes on Chinese New Year!,"Entre-Nous Creperie has been one of our favourite places to visit for crepes! Service was friendly and delightful as usual, and the food was as delicious as ever. Today, we tried Stephan's favourite -- crepes with roasted chicken, mustard and caramelised onions -- which has become my new favourite! To top it off, we ended the meal with our go-to salted caramel crepes, which was as warm, sweet and comforting as I remembered.

As we visited entre-nous during CNY last year as well, we may have unwittingly started a new family tradition! Can't wait to be back :-)"
Excellent service,"I came with a friend. The food is great and the service excellent. The hostess is very friendly. I love the dessert, homemade creme brulee."
Delicious crepes,"I have been to Entre-Nous a couple of times before, and they have never disappointed. I had La Ouessant and La Genan today and as always it was great. Thank you to our gracious host for the lovely meal!"
"Cozy place with delicious galettes, dry Breton cider and great service","There are plenty of good eateries around Raffles Hotel, yet this is our place of choice whenever we are in the area. This was our first visit in 2023 and they did not disappoint this time either. This is a small and cozy place, and we were tended by the owner Geraldine who ensured fast and efficient service.

The tomato/egg galette was delicious, and I also treated myself to a wonderful plain sweet crêpe with some syrup on the side for dessert today.

We left with happy faces and two bottles of cider.

Highly recommended."
Simple and delicious French food,"This is our fourth visit to Entre nous creperie, the food was very good with a wide range of galettes and sweet crepes, delicious cider and brisk service. Geraldine, the French hostess, is very friendly . Good atmosphere for casual and business meals, and easily accessible from three MRT stations. Located next to the iconic Raffles Hotel."
Wonderful service and good food,"I went to crepreie to try their crepes and it is quite delicious. I ordered the coconut spread crepe and the taste is awesome. Service is good as the owner, personally serve us and see to our needs. Recommended for others to visit this place."
Good food standard,"We brought our friends for dinner and we really enjoyed ourselves. Cosy place and great gluten free options. Our friends loved the food. Savoury crepe is thin and crispy, sweet crepe is soft. Appetizer and dessets are good standard. Given that it's a small set-up of 3-4 staff, they offer a good variety. I think it is reasonable to accept limited payment modes (cash or PayNow) for a small establishment."
Good food and service at Entre-Nous Creperie,This restaurant is right round the corner from my office and I hadn't been for quite a few years but was pleasantly surprised to find a menu that now included vegan and non-gluten options. My friends and I had a great time during dinner. Service was good and the food was delicious with plenty of choice on the menu to suit a variety of tastes. If you are in the mood for french galettes then this is the place to go to!
Excellent Crepes,"Got the savoury ham, egg, cheese & mushroom crepe and Stephan's favourite choc banana sweet crepe. Absolutely blown away by the quality of food and was very impressed by the speed and delivery of service. Coffee was overly hot and was not great for me. All in all it was a great dining experience."
Excellent authentic French galletes crepes and escargots and creme brulee and french onion soup and....,"...The caramel flavour sweet crepes tops it all! Despite the inflationary environment, I salute Geraldine and Stefan who kept prices as before! Will be definitely patronising more often whenever possible.
I am sure all other menu items are exquisite too!

"Really authentic, worth revisiting.","Had a really awesome dinner at Entre Nous. My friends and I totally enjoyed our La Brehat and La Groix savoury crepes. The buckwheat galette was freshly made to order and crispy. As for the sweets, I loved Geraldine’s favourite. We unanimously loved the in-house salted butter caramel on the sweets. Cider and organic apple juice were also really lovely.

A shout out to Geraldine who was a very attentive host and she ensured that we got our orders freshly made so that we could enjoy our food at their best.

Huge thumbs up!"
True experience and perfect service,French and Bretonne I am in Singapore for a while. I would like to enjoy the bretonne's cuisine. I love crepes and this one was fantastics ! The service was perfect. Thank you !
Great Gluten-free Grub,"Delighted to discover that this venue is still open, having not been able to visit Singapore for five years.

The savoury crepes are gluten free and so thin they just melt in your mouth. So many fillings to choose from too!

With only having five days to enjoy Singapore we enjoyed the first meal so much that we had to pay a second visit before moving on.

The sweet crepes are normally made from wheat flour but can be made gluten-free as well for a minimal additional charge.

Geraldine is a wonderful hostess - so much so that I was surprised to receive an email after our second visit wishing us well for our continued vacation. That's customer service at its best!

For great, tasty, gluten-free food you really must pay a visit (cash only).

Here's looking forward to our next Singapore vacation - we will definitely be returning to this amazing restaurant."
"Absolutely delicious crepes, good as always","I finally managed to make it for crepes at Entre Nous after accidentally visiting when they were closed. I had the duck confit rillette with gherkins and bread, as well as the No. 13 savoury crepe with roast chicken, wholegrain mustard and caramelised onions. The French bread was fluffy and hot, and it tasted delicious with the gherkins adding a little sourness to balance out the rich duck confit. The crepe was lightly seasoned (the restaurant provided salt and pepper to add to taste) and was just the right mix of sweetness, savoury and texture from the crispy crepe, caramelised onions and roast chicken."
Awesome!,First visit today and will definitely be back for more. My 8-year old has requested to have entré nous crêpe every year for his birthday! Oh and did i mention that Geraldine was really nice.. :)
Authentic french crepes and galette! Best in town!,"This is by far the best and most authentic french crepe and galette I've had in Singapore. Studying in Europe and spending most of my time in Paris, I've tried many kinds of foods that France has to offer. Being that it has almost been 7 years since I was last there (in France), Entre-Nous Creperie certainly brings back the nostalgia of the taste, the ambiance, and the setup of a narrow (and most times crowded) french creperie.

Geraldine, who is the server/manager of the front of the house is friendly and very accommodating. One of the things I tend to look for is not only good food but also good service."
One of our favourites for lunch!,"We started coming to Entre Nous for lunch a few years ago, and now it's one of our regular weekend spots. The crepes, both savoury and sweet, are SO SO good, and our kids absolutely guzzle the onion soup, leaving nothing but dregs for poor old Mum and Dad! The hostess, Geraldine is friendly and so efficient. We love this place and will always keep coming back."
Still the best and only place for authentic French-style crepe,"Came by on a gloomy Sunday afternoon with friends to celebrate a birthday, but our experience was anything BUT gloomy! :)

The last time I was here was before the COVID pandemic. I can vouch that the quality of the crepes here are still top notch. WAAAAY better from other places in Singapore who claim they serve French crepes. They have a generous selection of both savory and sweet crepes, and are flexible if you want to customize to your liking. Crepes are light, fragrant and crispy on the edges. Need gluten-free options? Not a problem with their buckwheat flour crepes. We had escargots and French onion soup for starters this time round - both were excellent.

Service was attentive, warm, friendly and prompt.

Pity that the place is a little small (adds to the vibe though), so if you have larger groups advance reservations are advisable.

Note that they only except cash and PayNow (a local funds transfer system)."
A taste of France … fabulous!,"This is a fabulous little French Bistro in a very cool location just opposite Raffles Hotel. As an expat here, I’m drawn back for the authentic French Cuisine and wonderful craft French cider.

Whist this place is definitely famous for its amazing crepes other dishes like the duck rillet and French onion soup are also amazing!

Top tip - don’t leave without having desert! You can thank me later"
Delicious buckwheat crepes,"Excellent, quick, helpful, friendly service. Buckwheat savoury and sweet crepes. Perfect for coeliac and gluten intolerant. Homemade chocolate and caramel sauce plus home made icecream- delicious!"
Always a top-notch service & food,"Authentic French creperie and a delightful dining experience- hostess is always friendly and attentive, hence we always come back every month!"
Coeliac friendly and delicious,I have coeliac disease and I think it's so difficult to find a restaurant for me in Singapore. I could order here a savory (avocado and prawns) and sweet (maple syrup) gluten free crepes too and both was delicious. There were lot of styles of food and the owner was kind and helpful. Highly recommend for coeliacs and I will definitely return.
Rare find!!,Fantastic dinner at Entrenous! Pre ordered a sweet crepe for dessert but we were too full!! Will definitely be back for more!
Great food and service,"Second time back at the restaurant and the food were as good as the first time. Didn’t wait too long for the crepes to be ready. My boyfriend and I especially love the escargot - the garlicky taste is to die for! Geraldine, the owner, is very friendly and made sure that our experience was awesome. Recommend everyone to try their crepes at least once!"
Excellent food .. authentic taste,"Authentic taste and good service ... ordered savoury and sweet crepe ... very delicious and fresh ... creme brulee was the best i ever had ... its not only the food thats authentic its the staff too ... staff eas very transparent in telling upfront about the wait time due to high traffic .. inspite of the risk of loosing the customer.

Recommend this 100%"
Great food and service!,"We had a range of savoury and sweet crepes for dinner - both were delicious! The salted butter caramel is highly recommended and you can buy a bottle for home. Service was very friendly and attentive, even though it was peak Saturday dinner time. Ambience is very cosy - we had a great table outside with a view of Raffles Hotel - my sister remarked that it felt like we were in France!"
🤍,"Check out their daily specials on the board. I had the chorizo and egg, and it was delicious! Service was lovely as well. A nice cosy space for a lunch escape."
My favourite place for crepes,My go-to restaurant for crepes! Location is easily accessible too. Good for vegetarians and they've buckwheat options for all the crepes. Great for afternoon snack or scrumptious dinner.
Delicious crepes!,"Have been regularly visiting Entre nous for years. Always enjoy the crepes here. Their home made salted caramel and butter sugar crepes are my favourites, simple yet satisfying."
Hungry for crepes? Look no further!,Very good service. Very good crepes. Very homely and cosy feeling. Definitely try Stephan's Favourite from the sweet crepe section.
Always delicious!,This creperie is one of the best we have tried. The galettes are perfectly crispy on the edges and the crepes are soft and buttery. We have tried lots of different crepe toppings and they have all been delicious! The escargots are also great - the garlic butter is never wasted and always mopped up with the bread roll that's served with it. Our kids love coming here - one of their favourite dining places.
Great Crepes,Amazing tasts crepes. Loved them. Service was very friendly and helpful. Only criticism is the place could do with a bit of tlc. Bit tired in there and needing some redecoration.
Lovely lunch,My little child and I enjoyed the lunch of crepes and ice cream very much. Mushroom cheese was a healthy option for child. I super love the salted caramel ice cream too. Thank you Geraldine for being a wonderful host too.
Great Crepes and homely environment,"My first visit here and it was my friend the birthday girl who requested to come here for their crepes. So glad this place didn't disappoint! Generous serving, fresh ingredients were used and staff were friendly! I requested for a birthday surprise and they were able to put a candle on our dessert crepe!

Nice and cosy place to come with family and friends! Will definitely return again!"
The best crepe place in Singapore!,I can't thank my friend enough for telling me about this restaurant.. they have the best crepes in Singapore! My favorites are the ham and cheese crepes and the nutella crepe for dessert.. there are so many others that i have tried with my family and i have enjoyed all :) this place is a must try!
The best truly authentic French dining experience Singapore has to offer.,"Tucked away in the high end Downtown / Marina district is a little slice of Brittany that is one of Singapore's best eateries - Entre-Nous.
From the minute you walk in, the layout, decor and atmosphere is like a local bistro in France. It has that busy yet relaxed style that they are so well known for. Geraldine greets you with a warm smile and takes you to your table.
My dining partner is coeliac (strict gluten free) and getting gluten free food in Singapore can be a big challenge. Entre-Nous scores top marks here - Geraldine knew exactly what that was and reassured us that one of their specialities is the gluten free buckwheat crepes which could be done with pretty much all fillings. As they make their own sauces and dressings in house, they know that it is gluten free.
We ordered the classic French onion soup, two savoury crepes, a sweet crepe and two desserts along with glasses of apple cider imported from Brittany (we had the sweet variety which was a pure unfiltered and not too sweet cider with an encompassing rich apple flavour). Our drinks were served very promptly and soup quickly followed. The soup was superb with the natural sweetness of the onions combined with the flavoursome soup was delightful and reminded me of the soup my Belgian grandmother made - truly authentic. Another amazing reminder of home came via the salad which was simple lettuce with house made vinaigrette. A source of confusion for my dining parter who grew up eating salads that had to have a multitude of other vegetables in it, this was what I remembered having growing up and I hope they never change it. Tender sweet lettuce with a tangy vinaigrette is perfect to sharpen the tastebuds for the crepe course.
Next was the savoury crepes and they were hands down the best I have had outside of France. Fresh and delicious fillings encased in an almost wafer thin crepe that would put many expensive 'French' restaurants to shame. This was authentic French cooking at its finest - with a focus on the flavour and traditional cooking methods. No strange foams or clouds on tiny food but honest and delicious French cuisine.
All the while and despite having a near full house, Geraldine ensured our table was looked after - plates promptly cleared, checking to see if we needed any more drinks and ensuring service ran smoothly.
The creme brûlée for dessert was incredible. Framed beautifully by house made salted butter caramel (which I was almost tempted to forgo manners and lick the plate it was so good), the top had a satisfying crack followed by velvety smooth vanilla creme.
After a few very poor dining experiences around Robertson Quay (some of which were quite a bit more expensive), this was the experience that blew them all away. This beautiful art of making exceptional food by using authentic house made ingredients, time honoured recipes and classic methods is what French cuisine is all about.
If you are in Singapore and deciding where to dine out, you owe it to yourself to go here. Because I think one visit and you'll discover that Entre-Nous (which means 'between us' in French) is the best authentic French dining experience Singapore has to offer."
Gluten free paradise in Singapore,I must eat without gluten and Entre-Nous Creperie is a paradise! You can choose all savoury of the buckwheat flour galettes and there is no cross contamination so a very safe place for celiacs like me! I simply love this place!
Authentic crêpes from Bretagne,"I've been coming here for years, less so in the past few years with the pandemic. Having lived in Montreal and France for a little while, I can say Entre Nous is easily the best crêperie in Singapore. Recently I brought colleagues from Italy and Netherlands to Entre Nous for dinner. One of my colleagues is gluten-intolerant. The chef made sure to prepare her galette with care to avoid gluten contamination. All in all, I've always had a good time at Entre Nous and would recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic, wholesome French food."
Best French Crepes in Singapore,"We revisited here after Singapore started accepting tourists. I am so delighted their quality remains the same and my friend who traveled with me enchanted their galette and a crape.
Staring with Brittan style cider, then galettes, followed by sweet crapes. Every item comes with well-considered ingredients, and very tasty of course. I never been to Bretagne yet so I don’t know the real local taste, but I don’t see any difference to the ones in Paris where people say those are the genuine Brittan crepes.
Décor is contemporary and the service is quick and the right time manner, the owner Geraldine is always taking her guests very nicely.
If you visit this crepele I strongly recommend to try their house made sea-salt butter caramel, either sauce, or ice cream. The right amount of Brittan salty taste is mixed with sweet butter caramel which is superb and addictive. Also, they have dry, sweet or fruity ciders hence you may enjoy different types of ciders as well."
Worth a visit,"If you're looking to spend time with family/friends over some good food, this is the place to be. We felt at home in this cosy family-run space. Shout out to Geraldine for her kind hospitality!"
Very nice crepes and friendly staff!,I go to this small family run restaurant located minutes from Raffles Hotel on a regular basis and it never disappoints! I love the crepes with salted caramel and the selection of savoury ones. Last time I tried cider and it was very good as well. Will be back!
The best authentic crepes in Singapore! :),"My mum and I are regular customers at Entre nous Creperie and I would happily as well as proudly admit that it’s one of my fave crepe places to dine at in Singapore. Today, we had soup, salad as well as crepes and we are always happy to find a consistent standard made by Geraldine and her husband. They are such a wonderful duo who work in sync as well as make food that warms the stomach and heart at the same time. Her crepes are crispy yet moist in the centre, with excellent quality ingredients.

Always brings a smile to my face to catch up with Geraldine on how she is as well as her family is doing, almost like long time friends! :D We will be back again very soon and to enjoy more yummilicious crepes! :) till the next time~ :)"
Unfriendly disappointing short visit!,Unfriendly experience- didn’t eat as when we arrived we were asked if we wished to sit inside or out. We initially said inside until we were told we had to order a minimum of 2 crepes each to eat inside ( memories of the Grand Canal Venice but with absolutely no view….. ) so we sat at a table outside. I’d add not one other person either inside or out! Only went here as saw reviews and quite like a crepe. Just after we sat down a single person arrived and was asked same regarding seat but on stating ‘inside’ nothing mentioned about number of crepes. This got my back up so we left. Been a long time since I’ve felt so unwelcome- and it looked like they need trade. Went up the road to corner and had lovely breakfast there instead…. Wouldn’t consider returning
Nice french crepe place,"Authentic french crepe place. Very cosy place and friendly people. Feels right at home. No frills, just genuine people serving good food with their heart!
Thank you for staying strong thru last 2years serving good food to us :)"
Good crepes,Really good crepes and galettes. The texture of the crepe / galette was soft in the middle but nice and crispy on the edges. Fillings were delicious. Even the salad felt very fresh.
Entre-Nous creperie,"The crêpes were just too good and the service was great. They even have glutent free options.

Thanks again Entre-Nous creperie"
Ranked no 1 for a reason and its consisgent,"Its rated number 1 in tripadvisor and for a reason. Yesterday visited as a family, my 3rd time, my wifes 2nd vusit and my daughters first one. All of us agree on the rating including the little one who was very happy with the bites of caramel butter crepe and the breadroll. This was my trip after covid and i ended up ordering something i did not intend to order but still they maintain the consistency. Will come back soon"
Best crepes in Singapore,"If you want a really lovely, cosy and casual evening with your loved one/s, you can't go past entre nous creperie. Their crepes are light and delicious with a great selection of authentic fillings. Cheeeeese! Bon appetit!"
Love love love the food!,"Never been disappointed with the food and organic cider (must try!) each visit. Fresh, wholesome, flavourful and no doubt made with love (feel it!) Love love love the food and the gorgeous owners too!"
Fantastic crêpes outside France,"One of the most authentic crêpes places in Singapore. Crêpes were crispy on the edges and soft towards the centre, with delicious savoury or sweet fillings that paired excellently for a perfect French casual meal with the family.

We love the salted butter caramel drizzle on the sweet crepes, and the emmental cheese, ham & egg crepe plus the avocado and roast chicken crepe too! Lip smacking with the cup of cider"
Yummy and Authentic French crepes!,"Great evening!
Lovely food, very authentic French crêpes, and the team is very friendly.
It’s a good location, opposite Raffles hotel.
I have been few times and I Will definitely come back!"
Enjoy Brittany crepes in sunny Singapore!,Warm hospitality and great food. Geraldine's Favourite is highly recommended as are the savoury crepes. The ciders are also a must-have.
Wonderful service and best gelattes!,"We reach there 10 mins before last order, the lady was very kind to have us seated and help us with the order 1st. I must say really appreciate with their positive service attitude. The gelattes was really good, better than the one I’ve try in France. We really enjoyed our dinner, will definite recommend friends to this restaurant."
Best Creperie ever!,I’m so into Creperie and theirs crepes are outstanding plus fantastic service. Definitely we will try more recipes next time soon.
Lovely Gluten free crepe brunch,"Excellent French crepes with gluten free options! I love the Briezh menu, no need to choose between savoury vs sweet crepes, have them both!! The cheese used in the crepe was very flavorful! Salted caramel was done with a perfect touch, not too sweet, which will make you crave for more!

Warm friendly service from Geraldine. Making reservation was a breeze with fast response and pre-order option available to reduce waiting time. My favourite French crepe place. Highly recommended!! :)"
Wonderful Food and Service,"I really loved the recipes, the environment, and the fantastic customer service offered by Geraldine. Will visit many more times in the future"
"Great food, Great value for money","We love the food at Entre-Nous. The savoury galettes and sweet crepes are great and really good value for money. We really like the butter caramel sauce too which you can buy from their retail store.

Plus they allow dogs outside!"
Brunch,"Stephan and Geraldine run a delightful breton creperie in Seah street.The savoury crepe with ham,egg,cheese and cream was thin and crispy and absolutely delicious.We had the lemon sugar crepe and the chocolate almond slivers( toasted to perfection) crepe to follow!Sooo goood…We will be back soon.
P.S.It is a small cosy restaurant,so make a reservation or just pop in!

"Best French Crepes in Singapore, period","Celebrated my 23rd Wedding anniversary with my husband and 3 daughters. The savory buckwheat crepes are excellent. The garlic butter escargot is to die for. The highlight is the sweet crepes. We love the chocolate almond crepe so much, Every single dish is well executed. The price is also very reasonable for such great food! Will visit again. Highly recommended!"
Second visit and maybe 3rd in the near future,"Geraldine sets you up even before your visit. Make sure you make your reservation a day ahead. You will have to place 30SGD reservation fees which will go into your bill. The reservation process is a breeze. Text her on the number on the website and she will get back to you within the hour (we got a response in mins when we texted at 10pm). You can order your food in advance which helps the kitchen prioritise your meal.

It’s a great place to meet. I prefer indoors because Singapore’s sweltering heat can be quite unbearable. But if you do end up in the outdoors, the restaurant does try to relieve the heat w several well placed fans.

Set meal was the best. It includes a savoury, a sweet crepe and a cup of cider which you can top up with a small fee to make it refillable. Crepes are delicious, and almost feels home made. Personally prefer their savoury crepes to sweet ones because they have more depth of flavour."
Amazing food and service,3rd time visiting Entre Nous and I'm still amazed at the quality of food and drink. The Milky Dream is to die for and I can't help but look forward to the next visit to try more crepe variations! This place is a must try!!
Must try!!!,"We tried the Entre-nous and la ouessant - both were light, tasty and filling. For dessert we ordered the homemade creme brulee and it was the best I’ve ever tried!! If you’re around, this is definitely a must-try place!! Also the service provided by Geraldine was impeccable!! Will definitely return to try the other items on the menu."
Excellent service,"Geraldine is extremely kind and attentive. I had the Le Brehat, it was very filling. I liked how it was cheesy. Geraldine did not rush us even though the five of us sat for the whole evening until she locked up, thank you for your patience Geraldine! My pescatarian friend was able to find an option that suited her conveniently as well."
The best crepes ever.,Really enjoyed the crepes - which were made to perfection. The banana caramel crepe was to die for. Will definitely come back for more.
Authentically French,A warm Gallic welcome despite us arriving near closing time. Sadly no photos but the crepes were simply presented and tasted delicious. I’d definitely recommend this place for savoury and sweet crepes if you’re looking for a change to the south East Asian cuisine.
Yummy buttery crispy crepes,"Both the savoury and the sweet crepes were fragrant and delicious. You can taste that the ingredients are good quality! If you are a fan of strong cheese, highly recommend Geraldine’s Favourite Buckwheat Flour Galette. Will come back again"
Magnificent crepes!,"Fabulous experience at entre Nous. They are the most authentic crepe is town. Never too oily, rich in authentic French ingredients, look nowhere else.
Only thing to bear in mind is to eat in need each person to consume one crepe, which is easy for us since I eat two myself.
Had one hot apple crepe - was magnificent. The apples are juicy and don’t taste old, fresh and well marinated. Cooked to order with no taste of burnt crepe, on point."
My go-to place for amazing French crepes,"If you are ever looking for authentic and delicious French crepes, then this is the place to go. They are consistently good quality, delicious to eat and the service is attentive as always.

Only thing to note that they only accept cash or Paynow, which shouldn't be an issue for the vast majority.

Highly recommend to pay a visit. It does get busy during the weekends, so would suggest trying to book, else you can turn up and see if they have spaces."
Good crepes,"Last time I went with my family ,that was 3 years ago.I had a very good time. This time I went alone to try different crepes -still nice crepes - very delicious ,good quality as before.No wonder the reviews from all different visitors are all good! If I have opportunity to Singapore ,I would go back to this restaurant to enjoy all kind of different crepes .Ones again .strongly suggest this excellent crepes restaurant ."
Delicious Galettes!,"Nice cosy, unassuming place hidden at the corner of Seah Street. Their buckwheat galettes are amazing! Tried the egg/ham/cheese and the roasted chicken galettes. Both are crispy, savoury and tasty! Ended the meal with a sweet crepe with apple and homemade salted caramel. Enjoy the meal! Service is great too, will come again."
My Go-To for Crepes in Singapore!,"Been here quite a few times with friends and family and it never disappoints!

Both the galettes and crepes are absolutely delicious with my personal recommendation being ‘Stephan’s Favourite’. The french onion soup is definitely worth ordering as well!

Always a top notch dining experience here :)"
Nice crepes,"First time trying Entre-Nous, and we liked the crepes that we ordered. We had a variety (the 3 Chef's Recommendations and the cream spinach smoked salmon). Each crepe was crispy, tasty, and had a unique flavour. We enjoyed it. Will come back next time!"
Great French food!,Great homely food and service. Must try the apple ciders and dessert crepes! Onion soup and ham/cheese crepes were delicious too.
"Heartwarming, authentic crêpes","Been at Entre Nous a couple of times by now and enjoyed myself every time. The galettes and crêpes taste just like what you get in Brittany, and it's a joy to be able to access those flavours here in Singapore. We got:

- Escargots: deshelled, which saves you the hassle of having to scoop them out of the shells yourself (although that means you do lose out precisely on that fun). Good texture, fantastic accompanying sauce - really the wonder of escargots in general - that goes perfectly with the bread. Minor quibble: would love to have even more bread to sweep up all that garlicky goodness. (The bread in question is soft and very, very moreish.)

- Galettes: I had an Ouessant (cheese, egg, ham, and mushrooms). The buckwheat flour lends the entire concoction a pleasingly complete flavour profile, and the galette itself is cooked to a just-right crispness. Star of the show you can savour with no rush at all.

- Crêpe: had a nutella crêpe. The nutella filling is very, very generous - you get enough nutella on the plate after slicing your crêpe to scoop and guiltily devour. Slight hint of caramel to the crêpe that's an excellent complement - I imagine ice cream would have gone well with all this too.

The crêpe may seem a comparatively humble dish but prepared this well there's no question this is restaurant-quality. Get a galette and a crêpe on the same night and you shall be very happy indeed."
Excellentas usual!,Me and my wife decided to go taste some nice crèpes after not going there for a very long time!! I am happy to say the food was even better than last time we went and the service was excellent! Géraldine immediately made us welcome andat ease! Highly recommended for those who want to have a taste of Brittany!
The Best Crêperie in Singapore,"We had been away from Spore for a while and it was, once again, really nice to be back to find everything we could have wanted from a traditional French Crêperie."
Superb crepes!,Very yummy savoury french crepes and pet friendly for the outdoor seats. Great service and nice desserts too. Will definitely be back again soon.
Excellent food!,Partner and I ordered a galette each and we enjoyed them! Do note that each person has to order 1 galette in order to sit indoors.
A real gem!,"Apart from the delicious crepes (both savory and sweet) which all the other reviewers have already attested to, and the refreshing cider which it’s absolutely impossible to just stop at one glass (or bottle for that matter!), what kept me coming back time and time again over the many years is the relaxing vibe of Entre-Nous which transports you to Brittany and the friendly service which begins even before you step into the restaurant. On our most recent visit, after making table reservation (which you will be well advised to do so for weekends), the co-owner Geraldine took the trouble to inform the day before that they were expecting a busy lunch service and recommended that we order in advance to reduce waiting time. I found that very thoughtful especially since we were catching a play right after lunch. Having placed our order in advance, our food and drinks arrived promptly after being seated and we finished our meal in good time, allowing ourselves 20mins to take a leisurely stroll to the Drama Centre (located just one block away across the road).

Thank you for the lovely meal as always!"
Excellent crepes! 🥰,"Absolutely blown away by the delicious Geraldine's Favorite, the sweet crepe with apple fillings. Recommend to have it if you go.
Tried the savory crepes and they did not disappoint too! Great portion size, very generous with the fillings!
Excellent customer service too! Must try!"
"Best crêperie in town, right in the heart of SG!","Very scrumptious crêperie both salty and sweet, best paired with cider 🥰 been here a lot of times for a long time with colleagues , friends and family, one of my fave restaurant. Thanks always for the great food and service!"
Best Crepes,"What an amazing experience and even better food. This gem of a restaurant is tucked away in a busy street across from Raffles hotel but never forgotten. They were welcoming, very helpful to book a table and the overall experience was fabulous. Highly recommend"
"Great atmosphere, amazing food!","We frequent this place as it ticks all the boxes: amazing food, good service, good vibe and the right price point. The crepes are all delicious and they are super accommodating about any preferences you might have. I love the roast chicken and sautéed onions. The location is also great and it’s a nice spot to sit out front and people watch. We love it and can’t help but go back for brunch nearly every other week!"
Great galattes!,"Good quality ingredients, good buckwheat & overall flavour, & they have a good variety of options. Plus, the co-owner (Geraldine) is always friendly & welcoming. My favourite place for galattes & crepes in Singapore."
Delicious gluten free crêpes and apple cider,"I had the tomatoes and eggs buckwheat galette (gluten free) and for the sweet dessert I had the one with shaved coconut and maple syrup and coconut ice cream.

I have a gluten free and dairy free diet and they have options to accommodate those so it was sooo lovely as there aren'tamy gluten free ""crepes"" or ""pancakes"" available in Singapore.

Last time I was here was probably 10 years ago and this place still remains superb and vibes are pretty laid-back.

A must visit if you're visiting the nearby areas in bugis/city hall!"
Still the very best creperie in Singapore and better than some I had in France,"My n-th time back and the food is consistently awesome as always! There is just something in the crepe batter that makes it so flavourful, and the crepes are always served fresh and crispy.
I’ve tried a lot of other creperies including those popular on social media but Entre Nous is hands down just the very best. Recommended must-tries - La Brehat and Entre Nous crepes to be washed down with sparkling apple juice or cider. Nutella or Geraldine’s favourite for dessert if you still have space (if not make space it’s worth it!)

A cozy restaurant with a great casual atmosphere for catching up with friends over good food and drinks. I’ve even managed to convert a friend who doesn’t like crepes to be a regular an easy recommend ❤️"
"Delicious food, drinks and warm service","Visited with my family including a preschooler and one very picky two-year-old… everybody loved it! The crepes are freshly made, and the salted caramel cannot be missed. Merci beaucoup Geraldine and team!"
Delicious crepe in the middle of Singapore's cultural center,Lived here 9 years and this place has the best crepes in town! It's very hole-in-the-wall so while centrally-located it still felt like a hidden treasure. :) Would 100% go again!
Entre Nous creperie brings authentic French crepes to us in Singapore,"Loving the taste of French food and everything else french, I was really excited when I first stumbled upon this nice little eaterie many years ago, and I always try to come back whenever I am around the area.

Owners and servers are French and it cannot get more authentic than this.

I also like this specially curated French apple cider, which in my opinion goes really well with both their savoury and sweet crepes that they served there.

Came back again today this time with my parents.

My parents are typical Chinese who are usually used to Chinese food. This is their first time consuming French crepes and they really loved it thanks for bringing France to us.

I think they might come back again on their own next time ☺️"
Hidden gem!,"We absolutely adore this gorgeous authentic little creperie. Not able to nip to Paris … never mind! I can never quite decide what to order as I absolutely love the house made duck rillet but also want a savoury crepe! If I’m lucky my friend will share. The highlight for me is the desert crepes with vanilla ice cream … you have to save room for them!

These small family run businesses are an absolute joy … I can’t recommend this one highly enough! Go … just go. You won’t be disappointed."
Our go-to place for authentic crepes,"Highly recommended. Entre-Nous Creperie is our go-to place for authentic galettes and crepes. Great place for the entire family, including young children. We've tried other creperies in Singapore and this is, by far, our favourite. The savoury galettes are flavourful and delicious - the ingredients always fresh. The dessert crepes are super yummy. They also serve a nice cider - the dry cider goes really well with the savoury galettes."
A real authentic creperie,"For the aficionados who love galette and crepes, this is the go to place. Great food!
Do preorder your menu the day before your reservation to save you a long wait!"
Great place to be,"We were 8 pax for a lunch to enjoy authentic crepe just like in Bretagne! The savory galettes were delicious and we all add excellent crepes for dessert to share including the salted caramel, chocolate and lemon with sugar. The cidre was also very good. We had spent many years living in France and the lunch brought us back to our times in France. Unforgettable. Despite that restaurant was full, the service was very good too."
Great crepes,Very enjoyable at Entrenous. We had a very tasty dinner followed by dessert and coffee. The environment is convivial and the other patrons friendly.
Delicious,The food at Entre-Nous is delicious. Definitely worth a visit. The crepes are cooked to perfection. Compliments to the chef.
A must visit,"My family and I have been coming for their amazing and authentic crepes since 2012! Really glad to see today that they still have the same quality and consistency that we love. The restaurant is decorated in a natural/beach theme, the owners are French and the food is 100. Definitely one not to miss!"
