Good food and good serive.,We really had a wonderful meal there. I really love the atmosphere of the place. The food was lovely. I am sure we will be back
Wonderful Staycation for a family,The hotel is very clean. The Covid regulations are strictly adhered to which was comforting. The staff are welcoming and attentive. The facilities are great and family orientated. The only slight issue was eating in the level 3 restaurant in the evening. The service was very disorganised. We waited ages for cutlery . It arrived 20 minutes after the food. And we had to ask 3 times. We had breakfast there every day and the service was amazing/ in spite of it being super busy. So our poor experience may have been an off night.
Amazing range of delicious food and great staff,"The food, particularly the buffet, at the Rasa Sentosa Resort is outstanding with a huge range of delicious and healthy options that suited all the family (including 2 teenagers). I am coeliac (so very allergic to gluten) but the staff here (in particular the Executive Sous Chef, Pradeep) was so helpful and accommodating helping me find suitable food and making me special orders so I didn't miss out. I would definitely visit this Resort again."
BASIC CLEANLINESS NOT MET,"The room floor was dirty, I had to wear my shoes in the room. The bedsheets are just as bad. You can feel the crumbs inside the blanket which causes my skin to itch. This hotel is not cheap, it is way overpriced and of course expectations was high especially for the basic which is cleanliness. The ‚ÄúGood old Days‚Äù buffet was misleading, they didnt have the durian station as advertised. They agreed to give me 20% discount. Not recommended even if you have extra money to burn"
Great for families,"I stayed here with my husband and 3.5 years old daughter in June 2019. The service was really good. The property is big and very clean. The room was specious and had a good view. The breakfast spread was good too. The bus connectivity in Sentosa is good from this resort. There are options available in and around the resorts for good meals. For people travelling with kids, there is a big kids play area and the resort is super kids friendly. Enjoyed my stay here!"
We recommended this hotel,"We recommended this hotel to our family in laws from Sweden. And they enjoyed it very much. Especially our nephews. It‚Äôs a kid friendly resort and many things to do. Activities for kids and aerobics by the pool for adults. We stayed for 10 days with four rooms. Our room was spacious and very clean. Mei Ling from Housekeeping was friendly. The hotel buffet breakfast was huge and lots of varieties to choose. We definitely missed the delicious scrambled egg. Service from Vera in the breakfast buffet is amazing. She reserved a table for us every morning for 10 people. This kind of service is a must especially when you have big group. Definitely a table for big group should be ready to lessen the waiting time and service staff can focus on clearing the used plates from the table. We love the food in Trapizza but service is inconsistent. First day we had a very good service from a young lady. Unfortunately forgot her name. She repeats our order and ensure that table sequence is followed. Very attentive lady and defo the best server. Next day we had a terrible experience. Guy took our order, repeat it and left. My father in law told him to expedite the kids food first and drinks but this does not happen. Appetizer for adults came w no drinks. Few Main course was served but not all, kids was served late and drinks. It was disaster. They gave us discount as they realized a big mistake was done."
Rasa Sentosa resort,What can I say about this hotel. The staff are exceptional from the reception area to the maids cleaning the room. The choice at breakfast was expansive from western cereals to Asian noodles. The pool is excellent with a quiet area just for adults. Should you wish the hotel is the only beachfront hotel on Sentosa the beach is clean with warm water .overall if you book to stay here I'm sure you won't be disappointed. 5*
Leaves a lot to be desired,"I‚Äôm not sure on what planet this hotel calls itself a 5* resort but this struggles to get up to 4 in my book
The room ( A deluxe sea view so I was told) was tired looking
The shower had three settings cold tepid and scolding hot
Breakfast on day 1 was excellent however that was because I went at 7am - day 2 tried to go at 9.15 and ridiculously long queue to get into dining room so I tried the Business lounge which was described as Adults only - obviously no one told the staff about that
There was one lady working there she had to make eggs ( a superb omelette ) clear tables refill buffet and coffee machine etc - she was doing an admirable job on her own
Staff were friendly, nice pool area but I have to say definitely not good value for money and if this is an example of Shangri-La Hotels then no thank you"
Must Stay to Believe It üåü üåüüåüüåüüåü,"Like you guys, we travel all the time, for work and pleasure. At an average, We do 100+ nights in hotels. Which is why we can say - We have never experienced such Warmth and Professionalism as the ShangriLa Sentosa, Singapore.

No matter how busy (and they are surprisingly packed all year around) you will be attended to quickly - or at least acknowledged - which is very unique and great! Letting us know - we will attend to you in 3-5 min is a Superb process !

Then, the Shang charm kicks in! No matter who you are - everyone is a friend and everyone gets that warmth. I‚Äôve noticed that with even a bus load of weary travelers. Big noisy groups, demanding people, large families, quite business traveler - all get the Luv!

The location, Right On Siloso beach, is simply Spectacular!!! Beach, sea, islands, the view is ‚ÄúSoo Not Singapore‚Äù.
The rooms are superb too! Families can ask for specific kids / infant / extra bed requirements- and it‚Äôs done ! Yes, it‚Äôs expensive - but only 15-20% more than other Sentosa hotels - but they are worth it. ‚Äú‚Äù The other RWS hotels are a carnival, a crowded hotchpotch of pushy tourist and baaad service. We have tried them a few times, hence cautioning you‚Äù‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt know how the Staff are training or what process they follow but - you never wait, you are always tended to, wait staff are an absolutely joy, breakfast buffet is constantly tended to - and cleaned / cleared.

There is Nothing quite like it on the Island, or elsewhere, so ShangriLa Sentosa - You are a Six Star for us"
Noises in the mid of the night,"Noises from other unit in the mid of the night, made few calls to inform the hotel staff but the same answers was given, they will investigate. No greeting from the housekeeper, no polite and black face from the breakfast (Egg Benedict) counter. Strictly No late check out allowed even only 1 hour (1pm) for us to finish packing and preparing kids from swimming pool. Be fair, if you looking for 5 stars rating hotel please go with VIP/suite/club to enjoy the better service."
Disgrace ! Clean up the beach,"On the whole stretch of beaches in Sentosa the ‚Äòprivate‚Äô one in front of the hotel is full of plastic , cans , straws etc and kids are even swimming in it ? When I mentioned to staff they said oh...but we clean every month ... ???? Sorry hotels around the world , 3,4,5 stars are cleaning the beach for their guests .....every day and several times a day . Iam sure you have staff that could do this in 1 hour .."
Amazing vegan dishes prepared especially!,"I would like to commend Pradeep Kumar for his amazing response to my vegan requirements. Many of the indian dishes at the buffet include dairy, so he made me a mix of curries and sides which were delicious. It was so good, I couldn't eat anything else! I will certainly be back again to taste his culinary delights again."
Such fresh food at all restaurants,"Buffet breakfast on level 6 was our secret retreat every morning, thanks to the recommendation of the waitress. Eggs cooked to order every day, fresh fruit, cold meats, vegetable sticks, pastries, toast, noodles, curry, rice, cooked breakfast and variety of juices on offer. Offering both indoor and balcony tables which overlooked the fish pond, this is highly recommended if you want to avoid the queues and crowds at breakfast time. All staff were super friendly and helpful."
thumbs up,refreshing view for a work lunch. the seafood pasta was great. tried the pizza and it was good as well. we had a very refreshing mocktails!! i will go back here!!
"Great food, friendly service","The food selection at breakfast each morning was more than enough to get me started on my day with lots of fresh fruits, cereals & yoghurts. Dinner each evening was a buffet, with a different theme each night. The highlight of the weeks was the local food selection, often cooked on the spot for you. The staff were wonderful & friendly, and made the whole experience delightful."
Nice Breakfast and Lunch Buffet,Breakfast and Lunch Buffet spread was very good and catered to many diferent nationalities. A good place recommend to pampered your taste bud.
Nice family beach resort on Sentosa,"At the far end of Sentosa island, this is your typical vacation resort. If you lucky you get one of the room facing the China sea with all the ships on the water. The other side faces the hills and trees, you‚Äôll get a chance to see wide monkey. Has its own private beach, if you are adventurous, you can walk to the other side where there is zip line and bungee jump activities available on the beach. There are free tram and buses that get you to other hotel on the island and the Casino. Non-Singaporean get in to casino for free. Shangri-La is a good place to stay since it is away from all the attractions but you are also limited in the restaurants and shopping options. Staff are nice in general but charging $150 for 30 minutes extra for checkout is not what you expect with a hotel like this. It is not even full at capacity. I‚Äôm told their buffet is good but didn‚Äôt get a chance to try."
Excellent just a few changes required,"I wrote a review of this hotel in January and returned again in February but Trip Advisor does not allow you to write another review with 3 months which is a shame so am posting my experience under the restaurant side of the hotel and look forward to a response from the management. My husband and I love this hotel. We have visited so many times because of the wonderful customer service. It is brilliant! The staff are courteous, polite, helpful and always ready to assist you with a beautiful smile. We came for our honeymoon many years ago and now visit Shangri La' s all over the world. We want to see this hotel keep its standards so we enjoy every visit we make. With this in mind I give a few pointers. Breakfast is busy at the best of the times and especially Chinese New Year! There is now an option to eat on level 6 I believe which takes some of the pressure off. There is a problem with birds and peacocks which are on the tables if you leave for a second. The peacocks also mess on the floor which is unpleasant and puts you off your food. The tables also could do with cleaning with a multi surface spray and not just a recycled cloth. The food gets passed onto the floor which encourages the birds. Saturday 2nd February we ate late at Casserole due to our flight. The food was not warm and the Le Creuset 'hot' platters cold. The food was very good and spicy so we did not send it back as 10pm and realise the kitchens are closing down.
Another suggestion is to change the order of how you serve the toppings at the noodle station. You queue with your bowl and self serve your noodles and hand to the chef to cook and add prawns, tofu and stock. Unfortunately you then have to go back to the end of the queue to get your chilli, soy, sauces and pastes etc. to top your noodle dish.
I would like to say that we have eaten at Casserole probably 4 or 5 times in the last month and every meal was exceptional and the service and staff first class. The buffets are marvelous and I do not understand how some reviews says the variety is poor. It is very good and varied and caters for all nationalities and tastes. The fruit salads are wonderful as are the curries and egg station. The children love it here as so geared for them. The choice and thought that goes into the kids dishes is amazing as so colorful and so much choice. I have never seen so many happy children!
Finally we are back in September for my husbands birthday and we cant wait! A wonderful hotel and the best staff we have found anywhere - in any country!!"
Fabulous Food!,"Each morning our day would start with a beautiful buffet breakfast from this great restaurant. One evening we had a dinner which was simply marvellous. What a great range of food from so many different cultures. My fave things were Miso soup, bread and butter pudding, just to name a few."
A not so wide variety of breakfast!,"Knowing Shangrila you can do better than this. People expect when dining in a buffet array is a wide variety of food. Our entire breakfast experience was not. Also, a lot of kids loitering around and pretty much touching the food in the buffet table. The staff here needs to prioritize table bussing as well. We walk to a table which there's a pile of soiled dishes. Please improve it's my first time here and I'm a big fan of the brand. It's for the best!"
Nice place but let down by small little things.,"Nice resort, friendly staff. Misses on a few points though.
Music not well suited for creating ambience.
No wine or beer in minibar in room.
In booking information no info of not being allowed to bring my Harley Davidson into customer car park. Now i had to leave it in a public car park off the island. Had i drive a toyota yaris it could have been parked by hotel.
When asking for a different room as room next door had kids i was told it was full despite it obviously wasnt.
So all in all a good place for kids but lacking in attention to details."
Not so great meal.,Breakfast are super but would not say same for a dinner. We ordered all Vegetarian dishes. Not well cooked though. Most dishes had some issues of taste.
Amazing stay,"We stayed here for a couple of days during our vacation in South East Asia. Everything about the stay was lovely. The room was spacious and comfortable for our family of five. The view from our balcony overlooking the pool and beach was awesome, The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly with each interaction we had with them. Our package included breakfast and dinner and we loved the buffet and all the choices. We found the pool to be clean and the perfect temperature. We would highly recommend staying here and can‚Äôt wait to return again."
decent food but crazy,"Decent selection of food, but crazy at the best of times with families. Caters to most dietary conditions and seemed fresh all the time. Breakfast had a good selection."
5 star is a stretch,"We stayed here for a family vacation. Breakfast is SO crowded. It is boring and the same every day. Kids are running around touching everything. It is really not enjoyable and we find ourselves wanting to wake up early to minimize the crowd. Our breakfast is included in our room rate and if it wasn‚Äôt we would not eat there. The staff offer no help with drinks, which is a real pain with three kids. They don‚Äôt even offer water. And clearing plates from the table rarely happens. We ate at two of the dinner buffets. Food was OK - and again crowded. The Saturday Seafood buffet we sat outside and I really think we were forgotten about. No water refills and our table was ridiculous with plates. They combined all the restaurants into one (except for the pizza place that is a bit of a walk) and all the food starts tasting the same after two days. We will stay somewhere else next time. We have enjoyed the property, housekeeping, kids club, but the food situation is horrible."
Awesome hotel in a great location,"Just arrived at the rasa Sentosa Shangri La hotel in Singapore today after a long tiring flight from Europe!
On arrival, we were serviced by a team of awesome people who would stop at nothing to assist! Very accommodating and welcoming!
Check in was a breeze! And the quality of the resort is exceptional!
We had a buffet dinner on our first evening and it was seriously incredible! Catered for every palate and every nationality! Great food, great cocktails!
The surrounding places are also incredible!
Highly recommend this place!
Will be back!"
A sanctuary for a family retreat...,A week spent here is totally well -worth. All the facilities are at its best and hotel staffs are super friendly and always at your service. We had had a wonderful time here and get back home with full fresh energy. Thank you for our great stay.
Great food!,"Seafood night on Saturday was great, with lobster, prawns, oysters and everything else seafood in abundance. Every night has a different buffet theme, i.e. Italian, Seafood etc."
Good,Good place to stay very good Cooperative stop location is very good near to beach and everything available swimming pool is very good
FAMILY FRIENDLY,"This is a resort best suited for families with excitable kids, not for mature couples wanting quiet chillax typical of other shangrila properties. All sea facing rooms will give decent views of south china sea and ship aholics will love it. Housekeeping perfect, room service expensive and 45 min. Very friendly front of house staff. Special mention to Karen in the business lounge 6th floor for scrumptious breakfasts couples only. Pools hectic hectic but well supervised. Should be mimimum age for children to prevent pool soiling upsets which happened at time needing pool closure. The main buffet breakfast was good choice but chaotic. Try carrying your own scalding coffee cups with young kids running round. Expensive evening buffetts but typical of other hotels. Great transport to other sentosa attractions. All in all a great place for families and a base to do other things. For those wanting peace perhaps the sofitel is better option."
Very Poor Food and Exorbitant Prices,"The food was less than average, no taste, like eating cardboard, and the prices were wildly expensive."
"Family dinner: good but not great food, awful service","Having enjoyed brunch at The Lemon Garden, the sister Shangrila buffet in KL a couple of weeks ago and as a regular guest at Shangrila Jakarta we thought the meat feast buffet on a Friday night at Shangrila Sentosa would be a good bet for the end of holiday dinner with our group ranging from 4 to 70 years old.
The first observation I would share is that the hotel clearly isn‚Äôt as well cared for as it‚Äôs KL or Jakarta counterparts. The entrance driveway is shabby, the guard not particularly helpful, and the same continues in the lobby and into the restaurant.
The restaurant is massive and the food
Good, although not as good as The Lemon Garden, either in quality, variety or presentation.
After half an hour
2 of our drinks hadn‚Äôt arrived, I had cleared plates from the table to the bar a couple of times so I took it upon myself to ask one of the waitresses if someone could please take care of our table, bring the remaining drinks and top up the water.
One drink did arrive but not the 4 year olds, typically, so I quietly slipped away and spoke to the manager. Of course this led to cracking the whip and he second hour of the visit was marked by considerably more frequent water top ups... but I‚Äôm afraid by then the service and overall experience had already fallen well below expectations. Even considering the 20% good will gesture, which was offered without request, I consider this venue well below expectations and significantly poorer than the food & service we received all week at Sofitel Sentosa where we were all staying."
Love this hotel,"We‚Äôve stayed at this hotel a number of times & doesn‚Äôt cease to disappoint. Stunning views from balcony - sea facing. Breakfast & dinner buffets offer wide range of food, accommodating all food tastes. Family package option is recommended. Friendly & helpful staff. Great pool area. Kids club is good. We will be back!"
Superb experience for families,"I want to thank the crew at Shanghai-La for an amazing family holiday. Here‚Äôs why families should stay here and why you deserve 5 out of 5: the pool and slides and pool side facilities were AWESOME, the
breakfast spread was FIRST-CLASS, the tropical location was BEAUTIFUL, the sheer attention to detail that is evidently paid by management to their guests‚Äô experience. My kids loved: the roaming peacocks, the room service cart/dining table, the slides, the pool balls to play with, the large comfortable sofa bed, the garden access, the complimentary mini bar items, the playground near the pool, the garden nursery with exotic SE Asia plant varieties and the ice machine near the room.
My wife loved: the self service washer/dryer machine, the barnacles by the sea Sunday seafood lunch, the pool change room dryer and lockers , the use of the pool and free refreshment room on offer after check out , the Garden Room bath room facilities and large size - It had a bath and a shower separately plus it was roomy, the quality of the food and coffee both in restaurant and room service, bed and pillow quality and comfort . What made me happy was all the things that made my kids and wife happy. We have two daughters under 8 and we stayed in the Garden Room on the ground floor on recommendation . I can‚Äôt emphasise how glad I was to take that room upgrade - it was perfect for us.
I highly recommend this hotel you won‚Äôt regret it."
A great taste and many varieties to choose,It was an amazing experience to find alot of tasty dishes under one roof with a great selection of every taste There is even a selection counter for kids If you are in sentoza do not miss this place for lunch or dinner
Dinner,"I tried the a la carte menu. The Asian dish that arrived consisted of - prawn rice with a fried egg on top!; a chicken thing that had been fried in bread crumbs; prawn crackers; and two satay sticks. Not really a meal, just things thrown together and put on a plate. Individually the food was fine, except the chicken thing, which was not edible. I managed about half the food. Great for my diet, but bad for value.
Visited 20 March 2018."
Excellent service,"Was signed on to the Golden Circle membership during my last stay in Oct 17, as the staff encouraged us to do so to clock points for our stays. Thus, we tried to use the membership to book the room for our stay this holiday, but was unable to due to issues with the app.
Thus, booked the room through booking.com. However, Arrived to find the points would not be clocked to the card as I didn't book through the website. Expressed my disappointment to the staff, and within minutes, they made the efforts to rectify the points, waive off supplementary charges and even upgrade my room. We were totally impressed with the service and recovery. Thank you for making the efforts to provide such excellent service!
Have stayed in Rasa Sentosa yearly for past 5 years and the rooms are of high quality, comfortable, pool view rooms have an extra sofa bed for the kids which we always stay in. The hotel is extremely kids friendly, my daughter loved the slides at the pool when she was younger and now at 7, she loves the activities like pool volleyball, skipping on the water, all organized by the staff. She loves going to the kids club on her own and would be there for hours and we always felt assured she's well taken care of by the staff. Breakfast is excellent, with loads of variety."
Breakfast was better than the lunch,"The spread in the morning has much more variety than the lunch but for the taste, I would rate just average. However they have provided a food corner for the kidsand I also saw a baby corner but I'm not sure what was there."
Quality and service,"Just life the overall hotel experience, the experience at the restaurant was too 5 star. Be it service mindedness or taste, everything was great."
Delicious exprience,"Wide spread international buffet that comes with kids corner! We visited the restaurant several times as part of our Family Fun Package and was impressed by the spread of the dishes and the cuisine type. Very delicious - great food, nice ambience! We will be back! :)"
A haven for old codgers in an energetic hotel,"The very best of A la Carte hospitality, to be expected from a SL hotel. The wines although slightly expensive (personal opinion) were quite sublime."
Busy!,"Such a busy hotel! Pool great for all. Great kids activities put on in the pool each day. Pool towels plentiful, no restriction on how many you are permitted to take. Guest rooms are clean and comfortable. Bathrooms are very nice and fully stocked with good toiletries. Free bottled water left in our room every day. Breakfast......l recommend you arrive around 7:30/8am. Otherwise you will more than likely be queuing for up to 20/30mins. Lots of global cuisines so you will not be disappointed. A few staff need further training on the resorts map! We asked one staff member were the Barnacles restaurant was and he had to ask someone else as he was not sure?! Altogether, a good hotel. It did the job it needed to do for our short break. Enjoy!"
Warm hospitality and nice view,Staff is warm hearted and breakfast is great. We were surrounded by peacocks while eating breakfast. One of them was showing off his beautiful tail on my departure date. A very warm farewell. It was my birthday the date I checked out and the hotel surprised me with a birthday cake the night before which is very nice. I got a box of chocolates when I checked out as my birthday gift. Will definitely come back if I visit Santosa again.
Choose something else,"This hotel has nothing going for it and would recommend choosing somewhere else

Location - poor for Santosa and not near the monorail service. You need a 10min bus from the hotel to get to universal or the monorail

Staff - manipulative and try and sell you a room Upgrade through dodgey sales techniques for example the people checking in next to us with the same room where advised there room was ready, our check in lady said we need to pay $80 for an upgrade (mind you we didn‚Äôt even want to check in early as we had things to do)
When declined the upsell the staff member got quite rude

Rooms - small and tired

Breakfast - this is why the place gets extra star , has good choice"
"Ordinary, a bit tired","Small rooms, canteen restaurants, difficult to get an umbrella by the pool unless you get the right staff to clear some of the towel on loungers before breakfast mob. Decent bar with good cocktails and generally good staff."
"Food, service and ambience @Barnacles","Our family had brunch during the Sunday Garden Party, which was great for kids! Buffet spread was very good in terms of variety and quality. Worth mentioning was the seafood, Indian cuisine and grill. Kids were delighted with a magic show at the garden next to the restaurant and beach. (There is also the option of using the pool facilities at Rasa Sentosa by paying for the use.)"
Excellent Breakfast options,Had great time at Rasa Sentosa Resort. Breakfast options are very good. Indian Breakfast was consistently good. Kids have special selctions to choose from
Excellent for breakfast or main meals,"Great buffet breakfast to suit all palettes and cultures - wide variety and more than reasonable quality. Exceptional value for money for main meals too, providing a more than adequate option for dining in."
Still thinking about those meals...,"The food was really delicious at this hotel. We loved the variety of options. Generally, I don't like to go to buffet type restaurants but in a hotel of this quality is well worth to try. Singapore is so rich in culinary culture and every morning and night we got delighted trying different dishes. We ate at the hotel for breakfast and dinner for 2 nights and there was not enough time or room in my tummy to try all the delicious plates. Also, the cooks and servers were so friendly and eager to help. It's been 3 weeks since we visited and I am still thinking about it fondly."
Delicious food,"I am stayed in shangri-la sentosa hotel for 4 days, it's good hotel because there have many place in same location and not far away from the hotel. Every days take breakfast here with so many variation menu, and absolutely is delicious. Also one night i have dinner in restaurant, and i am really satisfied with the taste of the menu. In the morning you can go to beach ( private beach in hotel ), so clean , not crowded and really enjoyed to stay here. I recommend it"
Shangri-La's Rasa 3rd floor eating,"We've just had a new baby and wanted somewhere relatively good quality, guaranteed to be clean and peaceful, so I thought ""Shangri-La Sentose, next to the sea, with beach, perfect location"". We had also had a ""work's do"" there before Chirstmas and the service had been excellent.
We went to the Sea Shell outlet on the 3rd floor. You can eat indoors or outdoors and t's a perfect place for a romantic meal (Great views), a family meal or, like us, somewhere where you could find a nice quiet corner so that baby would not disturb anyone.
We had the buffet. The food was as you would expect = lots of it, prawns, crab and 4 different stations - Indian, Noodles, Chinese AND a special section for kids - sausage rolls, noodles, fish fingers. Don't get this wrong - it is not a restaurant just for families with children, but it is simply child friendly. They even have a child's section (tucked away) where you can help yourself to baby food, drink, sterilisers, food warmers, nappies/diapers etc. Perfect for anyone with your kids. But as I said, with the setting and views this can also be a very romantic outlet.
There was no WOW factor, but everything simply worked and worked well.
Would we go again? Definitely - in fact we have already been back two times and are going again this weekend. Why? Everything simply works, everything is good, service is good and the setting/location makes you think you are on holiday and not in Singapore."
good food at santosa island,"Friendly waitreses, several types of cuisinis resturants, asian, indian, arab, moroccan and western. Al cart or buffet."
amazing,"Beautiful rooms, hotel, service pool service, layout of the hotel, breakfast from around the world in several sittings yum!"
Great food,Sat outside on verandah with great views. Device was fast and friendly waitress. Very big menu choice or buffet style offered. Good was tasty and well presented would recommend.
Wonder meal here!,Me and my family had our buffet dinner at this restaurant. The buffet spread was very good! We all had a great meal here.
Wonderful food in a great beachside location,"The food at the Sunday lunch buffet, although quite expensive, was outstanding. Everything I tried was magnificent. Great Indian curries (cooked and served by the truly delightful Chef, George John), Japanese food, seafood, salads, cheeses, desserts, grill. Although we weren't guests of the resort, we were permitted to use the pool that day too. We had an absolutely wonderful day lying on couches by the sea (watching a 1.5m long monitor lizard pop it's head over the edge was a bit of a thrill), swimming in the pool and meeting some lovely people. Will definitely stay here on my next visit to Singapore."
All World Foods,Shangri-La's collection of resort restaurants certainly cater for all tastes and food types of all nationalities. Service is allways with a smile ..... only to be recommended.
Buffet style food,The most extensive buffet we have ever experiences - a very wide variety of food available including shell fish and outside BBQ and pasta bar as well as various Asian dishes. Small portions available for children at the children station too. Great variety of fruit available. Very enjoyable
Love this resort,Best family resort in singapore. It's our second stay at Shangri-la Sentosa our first was just as a couple and we fell in love with the resort we had to bring our to young kids. We got a room with a king bed and a double sofa bed which is plenty of space for a family of four
best breakfast restaurant you will ever visit at any hotel,just the largest selection of food you have ever seen. There are lots of children generally floating about due to the local attractions and the staff in the restaurant tend to treat the adults the same way as the kids with the hand puppets but it is kinda fun
Birthday treat,"A birthday treat for lunch buffet. the spread wasn't a lot but good to kept your stomach at bay. After the spread, you are given 'ticket' for a swim."
Nice spot to relax for a drink away from the crowds,"Singapore is warm! So having a spot where you can chill with a cold drink and some cold water is great. We tried the pizza bar on the beach at first but no one wanted to serve us so we then went across to the Bar/Restaurant at Shangri La and were well looked after. Drinks, water and nuts thrown in as well in a quiet relaxing place away from the kids. Very enjoyable."
Had a great ew days here,"Had a fantastic few days here with the kids. There is so much to do locally that we didn't spend too much time in the resort, The kids club is brilliant, the little ones (4 and 5 year olds) loved it.

We travelled with our 5 children, the rooms are not as big as they seem in advertising but we did manage (not the most romantic trip for us adults). Overall they cater beautifully to families, the pool is great and the lifeguards on duty are very friendly. Breakfast is the biggest buffet I have EVER seen. Overall great value, and good fun :)"
Great Buffet,Stopped here when traveling back from Siloso Point to the beach. Very impressed with the quality of the food and the service.
Excellent services and food,"There were many options for dining in the hotel resort if you do not feel like going out of the hotel and the restaurants offered excellent service with great food. If you do not even want to go out of your room and prefer in-room dining, there is also a wide variety of foods to choose from, of different cultures so that you can try out new things. There is entertainment for all ages, and the hotel is located beside a private beach, where you can enjoy the sun and a clean beach. However, the hotel is unsuitable if you are on a tight budget as it is rather pricy, but I highly recommend the hotel if you have sufficient cash and want to dash it on a great holiday."
Great Water Service- but no food?,"We sat at an indoor window seat on the 3rd Floor restaurant for over 15 minutes, mid afternoon, not too crowded. After awhile I got up and approached a waitress at the buffet, asking if someone could take our order. Still no one came to our table. The water guy filled our water glass a few times, but finally we gave up and left.
We returned to our hotel / Shangri La near Orchard Road, where we got great service at the poolside dining."
Sunday brunch at the Casserole,The food and the service were amazing. The price too unfortunately. Fortunately one does not pay for young children. We had Sunday brunch at the Casserole outside facing the sea. Someone gave the children balloons and a magician played magic tricks. Eating there gives you access to the large pool which is well-equipped for children of all ages.
We stayed here at their hotel - fantastic experience.,"Rainforest behind, white sand palm lined beaches in front, surrounded by entertainment for all ages. Dine3 offered great service , an international menu and fantastic service."
derek singapore,the hotel was excellent the food and service was second to none the staff were efficient and nothing was to much trouble to attend to you a special thank you to sarah from the restaurant she was exceptional
The Hotel,"wonderful stay as well as great food wonderful staff you have a lot of things to do especially for the kids , as the kids club ,canoeing , flying fox up and down the beach"
Amazing,"The front desk rebooked my wife and I upon arrival on the top floor. The floor was quite, and the view was spectacular. Staff was incredible and very accommodating to our needs. The couples spa was amazing and well worth the experience. Our visit to Singapore was a last minute decision hence we had no time to play our itinerary. The front desk staff assisted us once we arrived making our trip to Singapore even more special. We spent 5 days there and that was simply not enough. I would definitely stay here again but at least two weeks the next time around."
suspect reviews,"Having stayed in this hotel I cant reconcile the endless AMASSING!! incredible!!! Glowing reviews that read like professional travel brochures..(funny about that) Sorry Rasa but the Restaurants are not amassing , the pool is 3 star , the service is average and the hotel is dated. Have a good read through and look for the genuine reviews before you blow your hard earned cash fellow travellers."
Hotel service - food - place,"Hotel was clean, service was very friendly and location was good. Food was excellent! I really recommend to stay there if you have chance."
A Great Sunday Lunch,"If you are looking for a relaxing place where you can enjoy your buffet meal without getting smacked by the crowd, while at the same time giving your kids a good time to enjoy their meal, this is the place! The restaurant has kids and baby buffet table where kidsmeals, sugar free juices and milk warmer are available.
For adults, there are variety of dishes....Indian curries with prata, veal and sirloin steak, roasted turkey, sushi, cold cuts with cheeses, Asian cuisines and yummy desserts! It is locate nearby Underwater World and Siloso beach, so if you're done with your meal, you can head down to the beach and d spend the rest of the afternoon enjoying the beach!"
Christmas new year break,It's very well managed resort and everything a family with young children need. Good for staying on the resort or going to the town. Taxi ride is about 10 min.
Not cheap,"I went to there many times at night , it's serve best seafood ,and lots of delicious dish, the most I like is oysters and prawn !"
"Fantastic varied food all over, different theme each night","The buffet selection is enormous, taste for everyone, their buffet is plentiful in size and food variation, plus it is easy to walk around and help yourself even if the room is full. We were a group of 5 and all of us highly praised the food selection and taste, well done Chef !"
Great relaxing holiday...,"Arriving late 2am we were welcomed by a delightful Staff Member.
Had a great breakfast. Most of the food was hot.
The amenities wonderful.
Very clean no unpleasant odors.
Close to free transport.Shuttle bus was great to Vivo City.
My only complaint the pool could of been open until 10pm."
Family Satisfaction,Our very fussy 3 grandsons actually ate breakfast each morning and went back for seconds. Wonderful to see - excellent and plentiful selection -
Best Family Hotel In Town,"I recently had 5 wonderful nights with my family at the Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa. What a terrific family hotel. My 6 year old twins loved it. They have fantastic children's water slides and shallow pools all under the shade. The kids club, called The Tree House were so nice. From the moment my children woke they asked could they visit the Tree House. The breakfast is probably the best I have ever had in any hotel. A big choice of Western, Indian and Chinese dishes. The evening buffet is similar but with a huge selection of seafood. The bedroom was big and clean. The hotel staff were all so friendly. 100% for sure we will be back"
"Excellent food and ambience, terrible service (once more)","went there for the second time this year for the sunday brunch. the choice of food and quality is great. also, the tables outside offer a breeze from the sea and add to the relaxing ambience.

the service has consistently been the big disappointment. it starts with the booking. on the one hand, you are required to leave your credit card details to put your name down for a reservation. they will charge you 50% for a no-show. however, when you complain about this then they say 'we can hold the table for you for 15 min' (as is standard reservation policy in singapore). when we arrived, our name was not on the list. and just like during our first visit it turned out a big struggle to have them set up a table for us despite they were not fully booked. frowns and bad attitude from the waitresses just would not stop. A place like this deserves a better crew!"
Breakfast is unbelievable,The breakfast at this resort is the BEST in the World. I'll challenge anybody to tell me otherwise. The staff are super friendly and efficient.
Great for families but Run down. Not worth the price,"Located on Sentosa island it is a short hotel shuttle ride to all the theme parks and vivo city on the main island. Stayed with my wife and 2 children aged 4 and 6.

For the positives:
- paid and upgraded to the larger executive room with 2 queen and sofa bed so it was a decent size room with separate bath and shower.
- the pools were the best and is fantastic for families. There's a separate kids pool with 3 water slides and the main pool was huge and a compared for younger children too. No need to go to the beach nearby.
- there a kids play room which is great too but limits the time you can spend there to a hour which is a shame
- close to all the theme attractions and vivo city via frequent hotel shuttle
- hotel staff very good and responsive
- best breakfast buffet I've had for a long time. Massive variety, comfortable for families.

Now for some the negatives:
- one of the most expensive per nights 5 star hotels in Singapore so naturally expectations are high. So let's begin:
- room was dirty, sticky floors and run down.
- bed sheets were dirty had to be changed not once but twice
- no where decent to eat at night, need to goto Vivo city
- location is good but tucked away so to go anywhere you have to go on a shuttle.

Whilst there were plenty of positives, the rooms were a massive disappointment. The hotel really needs a refurbish the rooms. I stayed in an upgraded room too so I can only imagine the condition of more basic rooms. I have stayed in other shangri-la's in other countries and this was not good.

I would not recommend this hotel for the price it charges and the quality for the accommodation."
NBest of Singapore for tourists,"Exceptional hotel for us, relaxing sublimely but so easy to get to town. We often stay here and will do so again."
Great for Sunday Brunch and then Lounging by the Pool,"This is a great venue for a casual Sunday brunch with the family. The selection of food is great for both adults and children, and once you let your belt out a notch is great to chill out by the pool while the kids have a swim."
Good Seafood Buffet on Saturday Nights,"We had the opportunity to dine at the caf√© at the Shangri-La Sentosa during seafood night. What a great deal this is! A great selection of seafood, including lobster, oysters, shrimp, smoked salmon - you name it you can find it on the buffet. The service was attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening and our meal."
Buffet Breakfast are amazing,"We had the buffet breakfast in our resort package and wow so much selection and was so yummy, great for families as well with a kids selection of food area."
Make the effort and eat out!,"The Rasa Sentosa has an amazing location and is a great place to stay in Singapore. However, a down-side, for us, were the mediocre and expensive dining options. Essentially a traditional but uninspired restaurant, an ""all you can eat"" family-orientated buffet and a very expensive noodle bar, resembling a cheap downtown cafe in all but price. The former waterside seafood restaurant has been closed (used to be great), much to our disappointment. It's a bit of an effort to go downtown to eat, but please do! Enjoy the hotel for its views, lovely staff and service but give dining there a miss."
Good buffet reastaurant,"The buffet restaurant is very big and has a outside area to it, the food is good plenty of selection of hot, and cold also a good salad bar and fruit, cater for all types of food. The only thing I can complain about is people don't put the lids back down when getting their food, this makes the food cold, which is not good we like our food very hot, the chiefs need to tell customers about it, its good value for the money, we did get buffet breakfast included with our stay."
Lovely hotel but expensive to eat or drink there,"wonderful attentive staff. Lovely amenities. very clean room. We were palced on top floor
(11) and had a great view of resort. Only downfall was price for meals and drinks. $6.50 + gst + service charge for a 330mL can of coke or $17++ for a pint of Tiger beer is basically robbery."
Brilliant breakfast and buffets,The breakfast Buffett was to die for everything super fresh and taste yummy. Almost made the $600 dollar a night room worth it.
Expensive!,This place is expensive but you get what you pay for. There is a wide variety of food and desserts and a different theme every night. The quality is great and the atmosphere is perfect for families. The staff is top notch and ready to get you whatever you want. This is not a place for a romantic dinner but it's great if you want to sit down and eat at the best buffet in Sentosa island. The only down fall is the price.
Do you want to enjoy good food?,"The vast amount of choices and the food tastes really good. I have ate there for breakfast, lunch and dinner any really all is to be recommended. Whatever your choice is, the have it and yes there is even a baby corner."
Very Nice Experience,The Shangrila Rasa is one of my best ever experience when it comes to hotel both in terms of service as well as the stay experience. The hotel rooms had all things needed to make the stay comfortable and the buffet spread both Morning and Evening was huge and delicious
Very Good!,Food was great! The location was awesome :) Very spacious and great ambience Definitely i would highly recommend it to everyone A bit non-pocket friendly
I like Shangri-la!,Everything is wonderful. Having a holoday with a group of 4 friends. Just near the beach. Reccommend to everybody. Super!
Noodles are great,We spent most of our time eating at the Noodle bar over the buffet. Buffet was a expensive depending on how much you eat.
They are happy to see you,"Everyone, from the waiters to the chefs, smiles and asks if you would like something different. Very accommodating to special requests."
Pricy but Poor service,"On the first midnight of the day we checked in, the performance noises from the beach made us difficult to get asleep. The day when we checked out, there were only two concierge people there and we guests were asked to line up to wait for the taxi instead of sit in more comfortable sofa zones just to make their work convenient? It is also confusing why there were only so few staff there. Imagine one guest taxi in and another departure, then whose bags should be dealt with first? Feel very disappointed with the poor service at Shangri-la."
satisfied,The food in all the restaurants at shangri-la were fantastic some of the best food i have eaten in such a long time. My only dislike is the ++ on everything when you see the price of what you are ordering then get the bill at the end the plus plus makes for an expensive dinner.
