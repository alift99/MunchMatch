Great service and delicious durian penyet!,"I visited Ellenborough Market Cafe for the first time after many years, and was not disappointed. It was Chinese New Year season, and my son and I enjoyed the traditional tossing of the raw fish with condiments (""yu sheng""). The raw salmon slices were fresh and generous, and the dish was delicious. I also had fried sea bass and Singapore laksa, and enjoyed these dishes. The Straits Chinese or Peranakan desserts and mix of cookies and cakes were a delight. However, what impressed me greatly was the attentive and courteous service delivered by Suresh, a young waiter who looked after us. He was thoughtful and prompt in attending to our various requests, and most courteous. The durian penyet dessert was as I remembered it - a chilled delight!"
Pleasant Dining Experience,Went on 15 Jan to have lunch there. There is a good variety of the buffet food. I especially like the durian pengat and laksa. The manager on that day (Darren) was very patient and ensured that our requests were met. The service staff was also very prompt in clearing our plates and getting our tea and coffee. Overall it was a pleasant experience for my family.
BAD!,"Terrible experience. The food were so bad! Only the laksa and durian dessert can survive! How could you even charged so expensive with such standard! No beverage options were available except coffee, tea or tap water with SGD78++/pax. Ridiculous! The lady fingers with chilly sauce were raw and uncooked. The babi ponteh was hard as rock. Fresh seafood options were just merely passed. Please look into this matter or else don't even think of calling yourself The Peranakan Classics Buffet. All your peranakan food were not even up to standard and huge disappointment on a new year day. The service were terrible and every service crew look like zombies walking around the restaurant with negative body posture including the restaurant managers. No thank you for this bad experience."
Excellent Staff Service,"A salute to all staff of Ellenborough Market Cafe! You've been helpful, courteous and efficient in all ways. Thank you for making our luncheon a great one especially when we are hosting foreign guests."
Place to serve local people's delicacies,"Went there for lunch with office colleagues, they have a wide spread of buffet but only catering to the taste of local people.
There were no vegetarian items in the menu. Upon request the staff prepared some Vegetarian fried rice and noodles but the raste was just OK.
Dessert spread was ok with local delicacies and some pastries."
"Nice Food, Great Service","One of the most value for money buffets in town, which offers an unparalleled durian penyet. Special mention to Mr Jega for his hospitable care and service especially towards kiddos."
Great selection and service,"We were surprised by the spread that was offered. While not many seafood options, the buffet spread of dim sum, laksa, rojak and other local delights were delicious. A lot of dessert options too! The green tea creme brûlée and durian pengat are must-try’s.

Service was attentive and good. Jega took really good care of us during our time there. Thank you!"
A tragic place for a vegetarian,"The buffet was extensive with a good variety of dishes and salads however being a vegetarian I found it a terrible place to be. Though the chef prepared some noodles and fried rice for us however it just didn't suit our palette. The dessert section was good and that is what I survived on. The dessert variety was good and they were pretty decent.
Not good for business meetings due to a large number of people talking to each other. It's good for a family get-together. Lots of seating and ample space."
Truly a depressing affair,"We’ve loved our earlier visits. Parents love the Peranakan food and the quality was high. Now, it’s really sad that the otah was not good, the soups were salty and probably the worse part was the durian Pengat had morphed into dodol texture. Previously the pengat was an experience second only to eating the real fruit. I know it’s now paradox instead of swisshotel but ellenborough surely you can do better."
dinner,"went there for dinner using voucher. the food quality really dropped a lot nothing stands out anymore. almost like hawker food standard but paying restaurant prices even with voucher. please eat your food and ask yourselves if nice or not??

service is terrible. water glasses not refilled automatically. soiled cutleries and plates not changed promptly. food is slow. they only had around 5 big tables and they cannot even cope well.

the next issue is they even set a chipped porcelain soup spoon on the table. obviously somebody dropped the spoon and chipped it at the side and they simply wash and reuse it until pointed it out yesterday. its obvious they didn't check the cutlery before doing the table setting.

showed the waitress the spoon and she was apologetic and replaced the spoon.

as such, please don't waste your time there anymore even if there is discount or voucher. well I guess it was 'decent' in the past but not that 'decent' enough for me to warrant a repeat visit over the years until only yesterday and this is the standard now.

definitely won't be coming back. there are better Peranakan restaurants elsewhere. goodbye and good luck!"
All-rounder goodness,"After reading the reviews, I was worried that the food would be bad; to a pleasant surprise, it is one of the best buffets I've had or at least this March lunch menu! Everything tasted decent except for the wanton, seafood is fresh, and portions they serve are reasonable (due to COVID buffets still get served to your table). Drunken clams and durian pengat are the best. Would totally consider coming back again!"
Ellenborough Market Cafe,Reservation with Ms Suhaila was a breeze. The manager/supervisor Mr Harry and his team serve very well during the meal. Keep it up! ~ MR SOH
Restaurant's standard affected by Covid?,"Made reservation for my family lunch at the restaurant on the first of CNY because this was one of our favourite for CNY buffet lunch almost every year except for 2020 and 2021 becos of Covid. However this year, the experience was totally disappointing. We can understand the serving arrangements because of Covid safe distancing measures, but the small portioning, low quality and slow serving certainly made the whole experience a far cry from pre-Covid! How can a restaurant's standard dropped so much, not to mention value for money. Avoid this restaurant for the time being unless you want to get the following experience:
1. Small quantity- one or two pieces of food per order.
2. Low quality - Chinese wax meat rice that was dry without any meat, sea cucumber that you have to find in the small bowl because it it one tiny strip, cereal prawn using frozen de-shell prawn that we can find in supermarket. Even the famous durian pengat, why add gula melaka and coconut milk into it to spoil the authentic taste.
3. Slow serving - I don't think it was done on purpose so that people cannot eat more. But I can't help to think of the productivity when people keep reordering because of the small portion and created more orders for the kitchen staff to prepare that resulted to slow serving. Not to mention about all the paper used for the orders, each table easily used at least 5 pieces though we try to consolidate the orders.

To sum it up, the restaurant is ""sick"" with Covid. Avoid till it fully recover to their pre-covid status."
Horrible lunch!,"Had lunch on the 1st day of CNY. Food was horrible even their once famous durian dessert! Their seared tuna was just unedible as it tasted as if it was kept in the fridge for days! Most dishes were pathetic and we paid almost $100 per person. Agreed with earlier review, food at hawker centre would be better! Coffee tasted wierd too. What happened to this restaurant?! Will never return. What a disastrous experience! Many service staffs walking around to clear dishes but it took a while for it o be served!"
Avoid This Restaurant,"We went on eve of CNY eve for the ala carte dinner buffet at $98++ per pax. Many items on the order list does not represent what is eventually being served. Quality of food is poor.
Examples:
1. Fish Maw soup is actually salted corn flour water with flakes of egg whites. No taste except salt, NO fish maw.
2. Dish with sea cucumber has NO sea cucumber. Instead, has pieces of tough meat.
3. Chinese wax meat rice has only hard rice in soya sauce with NO sausage, NO meat at all. Rice is hard, maybe overnight frozen rice reheat in microwave.
4. Chinese black pepper beef with celery is tough and dry like beef jerky. NO celery also, just tough meat Cannot be eaten. We return untouched. Again overnight food reheat in microwave??
5. Grill beef and prawn western style is again tough and dry.
6. Rojak has only 2 pieces of cucumber and the rest is fried you tiao ( fried dough fritters)
7. Rock lobster with Chilli Sauce has 2 big slipper lobster HEAD with NO meat. Definitely NOT ROCK Lobster
8. Red Garoupa with preserved vegetable is Deep fried Fish with nothing else, definitely NO preserved vegetable.
The list goes on.....

There are many other restaurants in the market at this price point and it is sad that food in this restaurant has deteriorated to this level. This could explain why there were only 4 other table of diners apart from ours.

WE felt short changed. Hawker center serves better food and definitely not at the price this restaurant charges."
A la carte buffet,"Had a business dinner here. The buffet has changed to a la carte buffet due to covid. You order the items and they are served. They are single serving so order more if you need. Local and international items. Good ones include durian dessert, satay and lobster laksa. Bad ones include the beef steak

Ok service"
Buffer disaster,"Booked a table for the family to celebrate NYE dinner. Buffet selection was unimaginative, quality of the food was below standard even tasteless, the bbq meat/ steak was tough and no flavour. For $88 this was one of the worst buffets I’ve had and didn’t feel we got the value for money."
Nice Ambience,Excellent Customer Service by Ms Agnes & Mr Peter Yong ONLY. They were very efficient & polite. Food was average & not as much varieties as before. But Laska was really good.
Dismal Food & Service,"When I think quality buffet, Ellenborough comes to mind. But my recent hi-tea experience was terrible, both in service and food.

Long story short. Provided feedback that service was slow because we waited close to 20 mins from the time we placed our food order to the time food was served, and the curt reply from the staff was ""We are busy"". I think there's a more hospitable reply than the one provided.

Food standard has deteriorated. I can make better prawn paste chicken using my air fryer. I think that tells a lot about the hotel standard.

As an Accor Plus member, the quality of the restaurants do influence my decision when it comes to renewal."
Feeling disappointed as buffet not as good as before,"The spread during lunch really shrunk coz was not as much varieties as before. Several dishes are on the high side of saltiness(eg:laksa,Babi pongteh and Rendang Chicken etc). Only the fried pork and Thai pork collar and Belgium chocolate ice cream is nice.Staffs are friendly but not as attentive as expected.Complimentary 2 hour parking is nice.But I will not foresee going back again in the near future.Abit disappointed as I went there to celebrate my 10th Wedding Anniversary."
Palatable & Delectable Peranakan Classic,"I was being invited & introduced to this restaurant back in 2019 for their Peranakan classics and was drawn to it, ... .... Ok, it was a Buffet style back then, which means I could keep refilling my plate with the palatable & delectable Peranakan dishes & desserts!

I would say today's lunch, the Culinary team and their EC, has managed the desired flavours, savouriness and sweetness with consistency and my friends and I enjoyed our orders. I had their Kueh Pie Tee, Ngoh Hiang, Nyonya Rojak, Ikan Tempra, Chap Chye, Assorted Nyonya Kueh, Charcoal Salted Egg Cream Puff and Chendol. Something New; Nyonya Bue Pea Bubur Cha Cha, I don't recall seeing this back then or maybe because too many rounds of the mains.

However, I would wish to see and/or may I suggest to have a bit more Peranakan food items instead. Alternatively, feature 2 or 3 Peranakan items bi-weekly / monthly. With the EC's culinary expertise & skills, well versed in ingredients and definitely the creativity, am very sure his team and himself would be able to bring back those memorable relish soulful Peranakan classics that was served in the restaurant before!"
Disappointed Dinner,"Menu is limited with underwhelming food being served. The beef sirloin was tough And the pork collar very hard to chew. The Itek Tim is also salty. Im very disappointed on the menu spread, not worth it for the price. No kid's friendly choices, only have desserts for the kids. Service was good but it's just the food quality and selection that is getting me frustrated. Furthermore, the table next to us have a lot of dishes on their table that Im pretty sure wasn't on the menu, even personally served by Chefs! We were very disappointed and will never come again nor encourage anyone to come over."
VERY POOR QUALITY FOOD!,I read about the high tea written by a certain food blogger in partnership with the hotel and decided to visit on 15 May before the no dine in restrictions . It was a complete disaster. The food was horrible but comes with a price tag of $48++ per pax! This cannot be hotel quality not even cafe quality. Nothing was good. They even forgot to blanch the new hoon in the Laksa before serving. My favourite signature durian pengat did not taste the same as before too!
Bad service and poor quality high tea,"Brought my family here for the nyonya high tea and was disappointed by the food and service.

The service was terrible, staff were grumpy and quite unfriendly, namely Denise and Johaina. Plates and bowls were placed loudly and impatiently on the table.

The food quality was a big miss too. Buffet spread was quite limited and the taste was not great.

Disappointing experience overall, this place used to be such a gem with great food and service, but this visit changed my impression. Will not visit again."
Great buffet experience,"Had dinner at The restaurant with my friends on 9th April. The ambiance is very welcoming and charming. Amazing food and service. Staff are extremely knowledgeable and attractive. They truly care about our experience. Special thanks to Peter, Sunny, Harry, Sean, Ivy and Junwah. Highly recommended. Can't wait to return!"
Fantastic food and service,Went with my family for buffet dinner on Saturday. Food was good and very appetizing. Service staff were very attentive and helpful. We love the peranakan selection and of course the durian pengat. Will definitely come back again.
Limited choice of food,"Choice of food is quite limited
The nicest food is their Chilli lobster ...
At 9pm when ordered extra food , staff said need to wait for them to de thaw the lobster ...
the last order is 9:30pm ...
But at 9pm it’s seems like they are closing"
Our festive dining continued ...,"We returned to EMC for NYE dinner. It was not crowded, so we enjoyed the dinner very much and the table assigned was very cosy.

We returned again on 16th Jan for dinner to try out the January menu. Love the grilled beef, sea bass, sashimi, pasta and the Okra with belacan.

Glad to meet Ms. Suhaila on both occasions and look forward to return in Feb for the Lunar New Year specials."
Weekday Buffet 1/4 of Weekend Buffet,"As Singapore opens up Phase 3 of the pandemic, group sizes of 8 were allowed. We decided to capitalise on this and booked a table with a 50% Amex voucher

This is a weekday (Tuesday) , I was just here last month on a weekend (Sunday)

Things that went well :

1. Salmon sushi was good
2. rojak was normal
3. Fish Maw soup and Salted vegetable soup was ok
4. Noya Kueh was good especially the kueh dada - ordered extra
5. Kueh paiti was ok, they even served empty shells for my god son (3 yrs old)
6. Beef rendang was normal
7. Pulot Hitam was good , i asked to remove the ice-cream, but they came with coconut milk, without asking - was good for me...but others may not like it, better to ask !
8. Service was very good , very little patrons

Things that did not go well :

1. rib eye steak was really tough, over cooked (10x worse than a weekend), i gave up
2. Tuna was stale and with lots of tendons
3. Unagi was also stale and tough
4. Beef strip loin was extremely salty , can't even eat
5. Cheng Teng was like drinking water, not sweet at all (good for me with diabetes)
6. Mantou was served without chilli crab sauce (weekend has it) , does not go well with lobster sauce

I have been coming to this restaurant for more than a decade, I expected a very high standard for the price we are paying and always got it - so I was extremely disappointed last night with the standard - its like all the weekend cooks went on leave and some replacement cooks came in and messed up !

I am not sure I am gonna come back again after this episode !"
Great Dinning!,"Well, the fact is that it has been quite a long time since our last visit here (we used to be regulars in the past) and so we decided to revisit to see how much the cafe has changed.

It was a weekend and we came by here for the ala cart buffet lunch. Well, the cafe has since undergone makeover and renovations and now it is brighter, more cosy and nicer than before. And the theme seems to be blue, like the ocean, similar to what Silvershell cafe is at Rasa Shangri La Hotel in Sentosa.

After settling down, we placed our orders through the physical order forms which is good as not all people at IT/Tablet savvy or the need to scan QR codes to see the menu.

We tried almost all the food listed in the menu as the food were served in single person portion which was great to prevent food wastage. And believe you me, the food were yummy and nice overall, having the peranakan flavour as it is famed for!
From the seafood platter to the cooked food and then to the desserts and fruits, it was good! Some of the food that left us good impression included the durian penget, seafood platter and sashimi (fresh), laksa (just nice, not too creamy or thick and was flavourful), ngoh hiong, fish. Pastries were good too, the nonya kuehs and chendol.

If there's area for improvement, it would be the salted duck soup! It was overly too salty (though by right the soup is supposed to be salty) and good to have another soup option?

Although the laksa was yummy, but taking into consideration not all the people love spicy or curry food, it would be great if they can provide another non-spicy noodle related dish like fried noodles, prawn noodles etc. For us, this was not a problem as we all like spicy food but we overheard diners from the table commenting about it. Besides the kueh pie ti, maybe having popiah is also a good option since the two are similar but easier to eat from the latter. And although the coffee and tea were inclusive in the buffet, they were not stated in the menu and so we had to ask before knowing that.

Service wise, it's very good as servers were very attentive and efficient in serving food and clearing the used plates and in refilling our water from time to time. When we requested for red cut chillies, the staff quickly brought over to us though she was busy serving food to our tables and other tables and we thought she would forget but didn't. And most of the servers were friendly and polite too.

Value for money? Sure, it was! With the credit card promo, it was reasonably priced considering the spread and quality of food. In fact, it's much better than the Asian Market Cafe that we recently went to (though they were within the same group), with lesser and smaller spread, only average quality and cost much more!

We will surely revisit again and surely it will not be too distant future.

We would like to award it a 4.5 star rating but since we are unable to give a 0.5 rating, we decided to award it with 4-star, so as to enable the cafe to have room for further improvements and I trust with some minor adjustments and refinements, it will soon be a 5-star cafe!

Recommended."
Excellent service by waiter Harry,"Been to Ellenborough Market 3 times in December. I have a habit of observing waiters and waitress go about their work and I must say I’m super impress with the work ethics of Harry Zhu. When some of the waiters are walking around aimlessly, trying to avoid eye contacts with diners, Harry goes around like a superman, covering so many tables at super speed. Despite that, Harry still introduce the name of every dish he places on our table. I was even more surprised when I saw Harry inside the kitchen drying plates. This guy deserves the best waiter award! I hope the management can reward him for his effort. If I were a restaurant owner, I would definitely offer him a job as a restaurant Manager.

3 stars for food
3 stars for ambience
5 stars for service by Harry"
Delicious Christmas lunch buffet with 50% eatigo discount!,"Came here many times since the restaurant started the ala carte buffet after circuit breaker but before that we have been long time customers. The service has always been good.

In particular at today's lunch, Mario's service impressed us. He personally made a coffee for us even though it is outside today's menu. He was polite and promptly followed through each of our requests. Other staff worth a mention are Sunny and Peter who were polite and friendly and made our lunch enjoyable. Due to the increased group size for dining under phase 3, the restaurant was very busy and though we waited almost 30 mins for our food, the refilling of orders came more promptly thereafter.

Due to Covid, we have to order the dishes through a paper menu (unlimited servings) and food is served in small portions in nice bowls.

Seafood platter comprising of small lobsters, prawns and clams, sashimi and of course durian pengat are our usual favorites!! Other items worth trying are laksa, salted egg prawns, otak, prawn salad, lobster bisque, blue pea coconut rice, mentai salmon sushi and bobo cha cha pana cota.

With a 50% discount and complimentary car park for first 2 hours, the buffet is well worth the money for the quality of food served. Please keep it up!"
Yummy food,"Went for Christmas buffet. Commendable service by a waitress named Pramala! She was always smiling and serving us promptly though she was constantly busy because of the a-la-carte buffet style. Quite a good variety of food. Lobster bisque, ham, and crayfish was very yummy."
Boxing day lunch buffet at sgd58++,"This a rather smart casual place . Do not expect fine dining style but this was good enough . At 58++ for lunch buffet, we get to choose from
Western, peranakan and local cuisine. Other buffet around town does not include peranakan food. The laksa comes with a large prawn! Must try!
At the moment i was tole Citibank , hsbc and maybank credit cards have a discount."
Awful service,"Awful.

We arrived at the place at 12pm. They asked me if my reservation was for 2, when I had mentioned that I wanted a table for 4 when I made the reservation.

We ordered food; only half of the order came. We followed up at least twice on the rest of our order. Each time we followed up, we were told that our food was being prepared. After an hour and a half of waiting and following up, one of the servers asked us to reorder our food because the kitchen couldn't find the details of our order (but then how did half of our food arrive previously?). He mentioned that they would expedite the serving of our new order.

No real attempt was made to placate or compensate us for the wait. Preparation of the food was expedited after the server realised their mistake, but surely, food arriving at a restaurant after an order has been placed is the bare minimum that can be expected? We were visibly angry and fuming - but the attitude we got in response was: it is what it is.

Food quality was rather meh. They really do need to step their game up. The one saving grace was the aunty who poured us beverages and cleared our plates. She really did her best in trying to ensure that our experience was a good one."
Festive dining Part 1,"We were here for Friday ala carte lunch buffet and were very impressed with the variety of dishes, especially the festive specials - turkey, ham and Xmas desserts.

Food came within 5 mins of ordering, so we still managed to have a sumptuous lunch despite arriving at 1:00pm, and finished by 2:30pm.

Thank you to Mr. William for your warm hospitality, and also to all the staff (we did not see their name tag) for the great service.

See you soon for Festive dining Part 2, as we’re returning for NYE dinner."
Good Food & Ambience,"Wide spread buffet & able to cater to different dietary requirements of customers. Food was good & delicious. Excellent & hardworking customer service team - Thanks to Johaina, Putri, Sunny, Jun Hui, Peter & Elle. Worth the trip to dine at Ellemborough"
"Friendly Service⭐️, Mango Salad ⭐️","Food was good and delicious. Service was fast and efficient. The staff actually go around and ask how was our meal! Despite them constantly waking and serving, they took time for that which we greatly appreciate. Su recommended some must try dishes and it was delicious. Denise was polite and accommodating.
Grilled Pork Mango salad is worth a 2nd helping."
Ellenborough Market Cafe: Lunch buffet on 6 Dec 2020,Very hardworking team of restaurant crew. Particularly impressed by Sean who was very quick to come by to clarify our requests (1) served salmon sashimi very swiftly after 2 missing orders (2) got us 2 full bowls of durian pengat after his staff failed to understand our earlier requests (we came here for the durian pengat!!). Very alert and focus staff while maintaining politeness.
Ellenborough Market Cafe: Lunch buffet on 6 Dec'20 (Compliments),"Menu list has shortened however, very hardworking service staff...special thanks to (1) Harry who was very focus and understood my request very quickly, was attentive and got customers' request fulfilled very quickly, very polite too (2) Sunny who was very hardworking, always smiling and and polite who attended to our request very quickly, very polite as well (3) Alif who was very fast in attending and serving to customers, very focus in his work. Overall good service rendered although we can tell that they were tired after the 2.5hrs of serving customers with all the walking around and attending to customers."
Ala carte buffet - some items,"Ala carte buffet - some items are nicer like salmon sashimi, rojak, seafood platter, pulot itam, durian dessert. We had a bottle of Prosecco which was good. To get service, hold your paper & hand high up. We had to do many times. Twice the supervisor dropped items including one champagne flute (HAD TO ASK TWICE FOR ANOTHER GLASS). Definitely won’t come back again."
Attentive service and value for money food.,Impeccable service by Agnes Sut and Suhaila. Well portioned food. Strict safe distancing measures enforced.
Buffet Dinner,Excellent food and great service! Environment was also great. Harry that serve my table was attentive and overall great service provided from him. My family will definitely be back again for the diner.
Fantastic service at Ellenborough Market Cafe,"Brought my parents and kids to Ellenborough Market Cafe today for lunch. The service of the staff was truly fantastic, even though they now have the additional role of serving the dishes. In particular, I would like to commend Edwin for his friendly and helpful service - he helped my father (who has difficulty in walking) to the washroom even though he was busy at the restaurant. Will definitely return again. Keep up the fantastic service."
Fantastic Peranakan inspired buffet,"Visited this restaurant again post-covid with the new restrictions. The restaurant seems to be coping well with the new restrictions.

Visited for their lunch buffet and was not disappointed for the quality and price offered. Service standards were good and staff were on hand to take orders to top up orders. Food quality was generally good overall with them offered an interesting welcome drink with orange and elderflower syrup. We were taken care of by a korean girl. I did not get her name but she was plesant and took great care of us.

Overall would recommend the place to my friends.
Cheers!"
"Enthusiastic team, great food !","Visited on 16 Oct. Not sure if hotel is open as there’s a pathway from carpark to restaurant only. For a Friday dinner, it was not crowded, we asked to sit in the large hall to ensure SD. It is ala-carte buffet style where u order on a piece of paper and they serve in separate bowls/plates.

The staff were great, service was fast too. A shout out to Suhaila, Wani, Chef Moo and Chef Kenny ( hope we got your names right ), they were attentive making sure we were comfortable and enjoy our dinner.

We always love to try a variety so indicated small size for all our orders and we finished everything we ordered. Pls do that to avoid food wastage. Oh, remember to order the durian dessert!!

Do support them, visit the restaurant and keep them going."
Lunch on 24 October 2020,It was an enjoyable experience with great food and service. I would like in particular to commend Harry Zhu and Ain for their efficient and friendly service. Harry even showed me the way to the toilet for the disabled across the carpark at the other side of the building.
Great Service and hospitality from the chefs !,"Went on a Saturday lunch with my family and the atmosphere was amazing! Food was great especially for their laksa!! Ordered quite an amount of food and it didn’t disappoint given how busy they were! Special mention to Chef Aaron for his cheerful service and assisting us and explaining how their food was prepared given how busy he were assisting other guests as well! Overall an enjoyable experience here in Ellenborough Market Cafe, would visit again!"
The best A la carte buffet,"The best A la carte buffet in town, we were their last Saturday, it was busy but the staffs were very accommodating, we felt guilty ordering so many items ( foods are soo goood ) our favourite dishes was Nonya Rojak and lobster chilli crab . Shout out to Manager Su and her team. I do hope they upkeep their first class service ! thank you for making my experience awesome!"
Excellent Customer Service & Good Food,"Wide variety of food for lunch buffet.
Food & dessert were tasty and value for money.
Excellent customer service by Assistant Manager Wani, Captain Harry,
Manager Suhaila, Edwin, Cindy , Marielle & Johaina.
Kudos to you and your team.

Worth the trip to dine at Ellenborough Market Cafe."
Amazing service and food,"Spoilt for choice? No fret! Ellenborough Market Cafe offer a wide variety of food (International & Asian). Not forgetting the friendly staffs that consistently taking care of our table.

Ms Denise is really friendly and proactive in assisting our table, recommending some must try dishes even though its buffet. One of the best service staff i met thus far in any buffet restaurant I’ve dine in!

Thank you Ms Wani for the assistance with the reservation! And also the Philippine manager Ms Ana (not sure if i got it right) for the great hospitality.

Kudos to you and your team! :)"
Food was great however service was slow due to covid,"Food was fantastic and Friday happened to be a weekend, so the lunch was filled with wonderful Peranakan food. And wow the durian pengat is also the highlight. Drinks are chargeable though however u can ask for ice water.

So u have to order on paper. However some items were missed out along the way. Service recovery was quick with some actions from the staff to make it a better experience. Kudos to them and enjoyed the last lunch back home."
Excellent Service Rendered,"I must say how impressed I am with the service rendered here. From the get-go, we were attended to with nothing but the warmest hospitality. This is so important because no matter how good the food and beverage served in the restaurant are, without great service; there will not be repeat patronage.

My dinner companions and I were there for its buffet spread. It is interesting how the restaurant has reinvented its buffet concept. Scanning a QR code displays its menu and patrons select their dishes, which are then brought to the table. This actually prevents overindulgent eating, something all of us may be guilty of. Portion sizes are in accordance to the number of diners at the table. Peranakan, Asian and Western dishes are served here.

Finally, we were surprised at the end of the meal when a chef walked up to our table with a plate of durian desserts, and proceeded to introduce the desserts one by one. I am not a lover of the fruit, but my dinner companions certainly enjoyed themselves.

This restaurant is definitely worth a repeat visit."
Awesome service and delicious food,"Celebrated my birthday here & had the ala carte buffet (due to covid, staff will serve your selected buffet items straight to your table).

Personally love the following items and felt was worth trying.
1) Rock Lobster with chilli crab sauce & mantou
2) Live prawns with chinese herbs & shaoxing wine
3) Kueh Pie Ti

Excellent service. In addition, the staffs were really very nice & sweet to offer on the house beverages, durian pastries for us to try as well as a surprise birthday cake for me. Worth the trip there, will definitely patronize again."
Lunch buffet with great spread and great services,"Decided to bring my family for a lunch buffet on 12/9/2020, turn out that my family was the first customer after re-opening due to Covid19. The food there was fantastic especially the durian pengat. The service there was also top notch. It is greatly recommended to those who loves local and western dishes."
"Overwhelmed with the Buffet spread, It's so Yummy!","Cooked Food such as Chilli Crab, Steamed Fish, Roasted Meat, Indian Cusinie, Seafood, Noodle Station, Sashimi, Sushi, Salad Bar, Rojak Station(mix fruit with shrimp paste), Roti Prata Station Pastry/Cakes, Hot/Cold Dessert - Ice Cream/Self-Made Ice Kacang(shave ice), Fresh Fruits - Overwhelmed with all the food, its look so delicious. The cold seafood was fresh. The cook food is replenish from time to time. There's chef at a few of the station to prepare order to made food on the spot. Go one round to try out all the food at every station. Second round go straight for your favourite food!!"
Chinese New Year Buffet Year 2020.,"Thanks Michael Gan for the great recommendation.
This is my first time attending buffet dinner my family in Singapore . What I can say , food is good , delicious with good atmosphere. The service form the team members was great . I will come again next year for the buffet.

From Jeremy Ng and family."
Spread the CNY Blessings,"Second time in recent years that we had our CNY Reunion Buffet Dinner for our large group of 18 persons. Very good spread, ranging from seafood to Western & Chinese cuisine, and many CNY festive food and goodies, suitable for a wide age range. This year‘s also featured a lion dance performance."
Excellent reakfast,Couldn’t fault the breakfast. Very good choice of food to suit all tastes. Service a bit haphazard but staff friendly.
The Worst Experience - Poorest Customer Service,"We had booked a table for the Christmas Eve Buffet Dinner a month before and was confirmed by the hotel on 24 November 2019. However, on that night, we were assigned a table at a corner. During the 2-hour buffet dinner, no service staff would come to help us refill the water or collect the plates. All of the staff there did not come near to our table, we could hardly find a service staff to come to help.
In the next morning, we had our breakfast at the cafe again. I went the station (egg/omelette), I queued up there waiting to my turn. After the one who was in front of me had collected his egg, a Caucasian came to the other side of the queue, the elderly chef turned to the Caucasian guest and asked me what he wanted. He did look at me but ignored me.
This was a very bad experience with such a poor customer service."
A buffet with local delicacies,"Came for the sunday lunch buffet to celebrate a birthday. Buffet spread consisted of local and perenakan delicacies with seafood on ice. If you enjoy a good variety of local food this buffet is for you.
However, the service was poor. We had to constantly call on waiters to keep refilling our water. There was a cup on our table stained with coffee on the inside. We had informed the waitress only to be kept waiting- she did not even return with a new cup and went on to serve other guests. It seemed as if the staff were inexperienced. The table napkin was also torn on the insides. Did not expect this from a 4 star hotel.
For the price, service and variety of food I would say it is substandard."
Huge Breakfast!,"Huge breakfast variety with plenty enough to eat for 2 whole hours. Omelette station was great with option of egg white omelette as well. Even a vitality corner which offers healthy options, alongside a real honeycomb. I like!"
very nice restaurant,very good diner here. nice relaxed atosphere and good service. this is the restaurant from swisshotel Merchant court recommended but a bit pricey
Excellent Service,"Went to EllenBorough Market cafe for dinner on 21/10/2019.
Tricia was the server for that area we sat. Her service was excellent! She made sure that glass is never half filled. And dirty plates are cleared before we come back with new dish.
Tricia is definitely an asset! Great job!"
Delicious breakfast,"Came in every morning for breakfast. Very attentive staff, and they have lots of option...Asian breakfast, Western options, hot and cold, fresh squeezed juices...it was all good. I was happy to see crispy and chewy bacon options...oftentimes it’s only one or the other! Made to order omelets were good too."
Quality of food good,"The first time we have stayed in this hotel, and will possibly do so again in the future. Buffet style, and waiters readily available"
Warming staff and great food,"We were there for a hi-tea gathering. The staffs were friendly and even tried to communicate with our children. They have alot of variety of food which is more then a hi-tea. We had quite a handful plate of sashimi, prawns, durian.. They served just normal coffee, tea and some juices. Don't expect rose tea, jasmine tea, latte, etc.."
Thailand Flavor in Sep!,"As Accor + member, I saw the restaurant's dining special for Sep - Thailand Flavors. The usual buffet menu, ie seafood, Peranakan and local specialties are still available. Great spread of desserts - both local and western desserts, and was glad to be seated near the dessert section. Reservation made with Accor Table Plus was easy, and great customer service as well when I requested to modify reservation time.

Some Thai dishes, salads (minced chicken larb & mango salad), Tom Yum Goong, Steam Fish, Red Curry Pork, Pandan Chicken, Tamarind Prawn & Mango Sticky Rice were featured. A little disappointed that the Thai food spread was limited, and Phad Thai / Phad Krapow were not even served, but a plain Fried Beehoon like those you see at Economy Fried Beehoon hawker stall. Mango sticky rice also did not taste authentic, sticky rice was not fragrant enough, seemed to be flooded with coconut milk. Tom Yum Soup was also quite watery. We tried to order Ice Lemongrass Tea, that was also not available, considering it is not a difficult drink to make. So Hubby ordered a Coke, good thing they only charge SGD 3++ per can, compared to other buffet restaurants that charge up to SGD 10++ per can.

Overall ambience is nice, clean with some Peranakan style wall cabinets and decor. Our table is a window table, but there is a 2-pax table just next to us, it was quite near that we spent entire evening listening to their conversation. They complained the Pandan Chicken was too oily, so I decided not to try it.

Will not recommend if you're coming just for the Thai food, better go to Thai Restaurant. Overall food taste is just mediocre. Check out my reviews of some of the best Thai food in Singapore or those in BKK, and other reviews of Buffet Restaurants in Singapore."
"Absolute Disgrace , Mis-leading Advertising on Thai Food Fair","Thai Food Fair which isn't , only Mango Salad ,Tomyum Soup , where are the Phad Thai, betel leave stuff ,the BBQ stuff's ,papaya salad. ??
What's being offered are basically the usual stuff of the keluak stuff and durian pengat...which EM cafe is renown. Its ok to have cold crabs and prawns but don't mis-lead with sub standard offerings.

The deserts are equally depressing, ever ate a Thai Mango rice pudding with undercooked rice and sour diced mangoes ? The cheesecake is a big letdown, dry and more of flour , it doesn't melt on your mouth ,more like what you get from Hdb bakery shop.Not a 5 star pastry standard.

Imagine the cheese and sashimi spread , merely pathetic cheese spread of camembert, cheddar, and was it blue cheese ?its not even pungent and it crumbles ,like a bread crumb. Only salmon sashimi and 3 variant of maki roll.?

The deep fried fish (using the same dice mango which is on mango rice pudding) to add flavour was decent but the cray fish stir fried with sambal , is merely lacking in taste.

The saving grace is only Sago Gula Melaka, bread pudding ,durian pengat...

Spend the $80 net somewhere else , EM cafe is one restaurant that I've been frequenting since 2002...the worse experience ever."
Weekday dinner with great desserts,"We were there for dinner on Thursday evening. So it was little crowd meaning no one queuing at any food station.
It has a section dedicated for the peranakan food. And a few traditional snacks food. The seafood bar had limited variety but it was good enough. They have also chili crab which is not that spicy at all so good for everyone.
The desserts as mentioned were great. So many choices and varieties to choose from. Both local and international. My eldest daughter started off with the dessert since she have sweet tooth before eating proper food.
Staff were friendly and helpful. Since it was not crowded they are very efficient to clear away any plates fast.
Price wise I would not say it’s worth it if we were to pay the full price but thankfully my wife managed to find 30% off from some discount app and it was ok.
The place may not have so much varieties as other famous buffet places but I do like the atmosphere and setting. Tables were also set far from one another so you don’t feel being cramped in. Would go again for any special occasions."
Great Service and Good high tea spread,Visited the high tea buffet on a Saturday afternoon at 3.30pm. The spread was good and there's constant refilling of the items. The staff were attentive and the ambience was good. was a good spread of mostly local dishes with some international options like sushi and sashimi and seafood on ice.
Long wait for breakfast,"We were staying at the Swissotel and came here for breakfast the first morning. We really didn't want to have the buffet, and instead ordered off the menu. I guessing it took 30 minutes for us to get our food. The waiter came once and apologized for taking so long. The food we got was good and well cooked, but boy were we hungry waiting so long and watching everyone around us gobble up the buffet food. We chose to eat elsewhere the rest of our stay."
Solid But Inaccessible Crabs for Crab-ilicious Buffet,"I
Crab-ilicious Buffet $91.81

I
Meaty fresh crabs

Sashimi, an item which isn't always available even at such prices

Smooth and fragrant Durian Pengat

Replenishment of table serviettes without prompting

I
Crab shells were incredibly tough to crack, even with the crab crackers aka giap giaps. Got so annoyed that I resorted to eating non-claws, which of course made for a less shiok experience

Noticeably slow food replenishment after 845pm, which is way too early

Burnt taste in green bean soup"

Excellent Lunch Buffet Spread,The buffet spread has excellent selections. Food was good and nice layout. My favourite choice - nonya desserts & durian pengat.
Excellent Buffet Spread !!!,"For this Ellenborough Market Cafe, myself have been there for buffet meals, since last year, with family, relatives, close friends, and colleagues ... amazingly total 9 times !!! The buffet spread has excellent selections, very tasty and nice layout, especially the raw seafood, cooked dishes and nonya desserts. My favorite choice is durian pengat :)

Just last week, I went with my siblings, for a birthday celebration. We had great time enjoying our food again. Will continue to dine there :)"
*DINNER CRAB BUFFET*,Poor quality! Disappointed 😔 we came for the crabs but ended up with bare min consumption. Crabs v small.. definitely overpriced for $78 per person. Won’t be patronising this place again. This is the worst experience ever for crabs eating!!
Crab buffet.,"I was here on 8 Jun 2019 for the crabilious buffet. It was a great disapointment. The cold crab was not fresh. The selection of crab was small, the snow crab leg was miserable. The size of the crab was tiny, smaller than 350gm per crab.
Please do not go if you are going for crab. I was there looking for crab and vow never to go to a merchant court crab buffet again.

A Disappointed Crab Meal"
Excellent,"We are a family of 12 pax celebrating 3 birthdays. Had to accommodate 2 tables. Thank you Wani and her colleagues Douglas and Tricia for their excellent service.
Plates are constantly changed, water replenished and they are so pleasant, helpful and hospitable. Will come again.
Ellenborough Market carries fond memories."
High tea,"Food is not as fresh as I expect and taste is soso... tim sum quality is not good , spaghetti is bad and soggy.

Lasaka is fine .. satay is tough.. no cucumber and onions ? No sushi ?? Refill of cold dish - prawn is slow .. sashimi is average .

Durian dessert is fine .. as for the rest of the dessert in the fridge not as tasty as it look .. the looks are great . Coffee taste horrible !"
dinner,1 for 1 is very worth it. quite a lot of variety. there’s sashimi for dinner but no oysters. staff was quite attentive.
Dinner Buffet,"My first visit here for a dinner buffet with my colleagues. The seating was generously spacious and I just love the Peranakan atmosphere. If you are looking for great Nongya dishes, this is the place i would recommend. Must try, Laska, Peking duck wrap, crayfish and Durian mesh dessert. Price is $69 ++ per pax, 1 for 1 if you have a Maybank or Diners Club cc, up to maximumu of 4 pax. Staffs were extremely friendly and attentive. All in all, would come back again to try other dishes that I'd missed out last night."
Weekend dinner,Came with the family to celebrate Mother’s Day.. love that they have big round tables but you need to request for these and make reservations in advance as it was pretty crowded. Food is mainly local and nyonya. Handmade noodles was really good! Big thanks to the manager Wani for the excellent service and for making the arrangements!
Dinner buffet,"Got a surprise Mother's Day dinner buffet from my husband at this restaurant. Guessed it must be because of its reputation and reasonable price that's why the place was almost fully booked that night. Though it was busy but the staff were very helpful, attentive and friendly. Manager Suhaila gave the mummies a premium soup. My husband got one too as he is the only man on the table. A very thoughtful gesture. Will definitely come back again next time."
Office Lunch,"Excellent ambience for getting together, for bonding over food , meal extremely reasonable as on promotion specially the service provided by the restaurant staffs in particular the lady assistant manager who is very pleasant, thoughtful and understanding. In her its clients'/ customers its the cafes priority if it does not affect the company."
Affordable Feed,"It was my first time having buffet at Ellenborough Market Cafe, the overall food quality and varieties are adequate for the price. Very beautiful atmosphere and desserts are great. Unfortunately on Saturday, it was very crowded and many food courses finish fast and have to wait few batches till can get to try. Service can be improved as was told by staffs that they run out of napkins while we saw other tables have napkins. Waitress/waiter could have been more proactive in serving drinks and not wait for customers to request their services."
Pleasant n value for$$.,"Food, atmospher n services overall satisfying! Enjoyed ourselves lots! Will be back! Will recommend friends this place if they are looking for good food n value for their money."
Weekend high tea,"Decent high tea at a central location next to Clarke Quay. Food spread includes several popular Peranakan dishes - laksa, kuek Pie Tie, kuek dessert, rojah...the laksa is very good. The soup is thick and flavorful. The durian pengat is so delicious! There is also cold appetizers including salmon and octopus sashimi, chilled prawn, small mussels and lala, as well as salads & maki. Very fresh seafood and salad. There’s also western and Asian food, cakes, ice kachang, ice cream...too much to choose from. My daughter thinks highly of the vegetarian pizza. The dim sum is mediocre. Pasta looks too dry and untouched. The rest of the food is average. Coffee & tea are inclusive. We managed to get 20% discount and paid $79 net for 2, which is quite reasonable for a hotel high tea."
dinner buffet,"if you love peranakan food, you should check out this restaurant buffet dinner. service and food quality are above average."
Buffet spread is great,"The buffet spread is great as there are just so much of variety of food to eat. The quality and choices of food are good even for ala carte menu. Special mention of staff, Peter who is always very attentive, efficient and most accommodating to your requests. The layout of the cafe is spacious and comfortable. In the ala carte menu the cod fillet and nonya laska are really good. Fragrant, yummy and huge portion."
Weekend High Tea Buffet,"Went there for weekend high tea buffet. Its location is fantastic as it is close to China Town plus it is very near Clarke Quay MRT station. Hotel itself is a bit old and needs an upgrade or renovation. The restaurant was reasonably clean and tidy. Reasonable variety of food. I have to commend the young gentleman in charge of the noodle bar. He was very pleasant and professional in entertaining individual customers' taste preference. Well done! The only setback was a rather small and limited choice of Nyonya food selection which Singapore so is famous and proud of.... The last but vital extremely BAD thing about this so called High Tea Buffet was you can only choose English Breakfast tea or ordinary brewed coffee! I am appalled that a Singapore 4 star hotel would limit the choice of tea or coffee for a medium to high price hotel buffet. Somewhere, somehow, I think the hotel should think twice as this practice simply did not make sense! If you think the hotel should make more money, raise the buffet price but don't provide a second class service to your customer!!!!! Can't imagine this can happen in Singapore???????"
Lovely Breakfast,"Being an Accor Plus member, we decided to go for breakfast at Ellenborough Cafe on Wednesday morning to entertain our friends who came to visit. The buffet has many varieties from Asian to American breakfast. Fresh juices were also available which was great. Coffee was not too good so I changed to tea instead.
Service was also very attentive. Lady Manager was friendly and the egg counter Chef were very efficient.
And we get a good discount for being a Accor member.
We have found a perfect place for a good breakfast."
The quality continues,"We had our breakfast in the Ellenborough Market Cafe included in our room rate, but I would have happily paid if I needed to.

The quality and selection of food available in the breakfast/brunch buffet is almost overwhelming, certainly too much to take in on just one visit.

Traditional western food, a great selections of fresh fruits and fantastic asian dishes all made for some hard decisions!

Of particular note is bacon presented either “crispy” or “soft”. A choice that kept us both happy but one that I have never encountered before.

The decor is light, airy and contemporary with great artifacts celebrating the merchant/ trading history of the location on the Singapore River.

On top of all of that, it is the friendly and professional service that is most appreciated.

I look forward to our return visit next month for Chinese New Year!"
"Good service, good food if you managed to get discount","Some discounts for credit cards for buffet lunch/dinner. We went for high tea only on weekends.

favourite durian purée, prawns and mussels, salmon sushi and laksa.

Service is good, nut they worked very hard to clear your used plates very fast, refill water too, but tea refill not that fast.. There was a little miscommunication in their staffs but we managed to resolve before payment.

The price is around s$50+ per person without discount. So I usually go when I can get discounts to max my value for monies."
Wow,"Had lunch at the cafe just over the weekend. Was blown away by the selection of food. It is a good place for anyone who is travelling through Singapore or has just return from living away from Singapore. I had my filled of nonya food, hawker food, sashimi, fresh seafood etc etc! I counted there would have been at least 30 to 40 choices of dessert!
It was easy to get to as well, just above Clark Quay MRT station!
Price was really reasonable if you book through the app eatiago!
Die die must try!"
Fantastic little cafe,We stayed at adjoining hotel and enjoyed daily breakfast during our stay. Great variety of food and extremely friendly and obliging staff.
"Limited Selection, Overpriced and Short on Waitstaff","If not for the 50% promo discount that I got from the Eatigo App, this place would not be worth the price. The buffet is quite limited, with some Chinese dishes, some Peranakan dishes, salad, cheese and only a salmon sashimi for the Japanese selection. Many dishes had run out by 8:30 pm and were not replenished. Food quality is not bad, but not really great. As with most restaurants in Singapore, there's a massive labour shortage here and only about five waitstaff for the whole restaurant, which was at full-capacity. The poor waitstaff were running around so much, serving beverages, clearing plates and bringing checks and they were overworked and overwhelmed. Many tables were not cleared of the dirty plates and we had to carry ours off to clear them ourselves. This was not the staff's fault as you could see how stressed out and busy they were; it's just typical now of restaurants in Singapore where labour is in short supply and the government's tight foreign worker restrictions mean that most businesses are just massively understaffed. The staff shortage is seen in both the quality of food, the slow replenishment of empty tureens and the slow service despite the harried rushing staff."
"Amazing spread, great service (Dinner & breakfast)",Amazing spread of food for both dinner and breakfast. Staff always greets you with a smile and are very helpful and efficient in clearing plates and offering drinks. 10/10 would return again!
Christmas dinner,"The quality and varieties of food were great and price was reasonable, just hope that since it’s near Christmas season, there was more Christmas themed food provided. Service was good too, staff was attentive and very responsive to our requests, would definitely recommend my friends to come here"
Delicious breakfast buffet,"We ate breakfast at this cafe daily for our five night stay at the Swissotel. Staff were consistently friendly and attentive. We became particularly fond of waitress Molly as she anticipated our needs, was highly efficient and the kids loved her.

The children were very impressed with the pancake machine. Press the button and within a minute, it would pop our two freshly made pancakes.

There was an array of food on offer, all delicious and well presented.

On arrival staff would immediately take your coffee order and swiftly bring it to the table.

What more could you ask for!"
