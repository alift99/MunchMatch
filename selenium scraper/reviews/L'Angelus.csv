Average,"everything is quite average except the Fois Gras, but probably worthing trying their lunch set with lower value"

Daughter loves it!,"My 7 years old daughter insisted to give them a rate of 5 star. She loves the restaurant so much! The ambience, the food, the service are all excellent!"
Authentic and delicious French food,"Loved the decor, ambience & music played throughout dinner. Service was excellent by all that served and interacted with us. The staff were very knowledgeable and gave wonderful recommendations for dinner.

The food was some of the best I‚Äôve had! The escargots & foie gras are must-try appetisers. The lamb rack & duck confit are traditionally French and tasted wonderful. Please do try the crepe Suzette which is cooked in front of you and served warm and topped with ice cream and just a wonderful gastronomic experience.

They have a large wine selection and the Bordeux red wine that was recommended was delicious!

I do forsee myself being a regular guest here. Thank you for the wonderful experience :)"
Food cleanliness issue?,"I visited the restaurant last Friday to celebrate my colleague's birthday. 3 of us were there for the occasion.

The wine we ordered was good and the food presentation was beautiful.

However, 2 of us were hit by severe food-poisoning reaction after lunch - my colleague suffered nausea and vomited multiple times while I am experienced stomach cramps and ongoing diarrhea for 3 days and the symptoms are still continuing.
We suspect our reaction could have been the result of the salad we shared, that our 3rd colleague didn't eat.

It is such a shame that it will remain a memorable experience in a way we hadn't planned for."
A Lunch That Had Lots of Promise,"We had lunch on 25 April 2022.

The female server wasn‚Äôt very friendly at first, but she warmed up over time (!).

Loved the ambience, especially the pictures hanging on the wall.

Food was, on the whole, good. But I prefer my steak served with a sauce (a must even when cooking at home), so it was disappointingly dry despite a nice grilled exterior. The homemade pate and baked bone marrow were yummy, as were the fries and cheese platter. The cr√®me br√ªl√©e was way too much - a smaller serving would have been more elegant and palatable.

The restroom at the back of the restaurant had an alarmingly faulty door which could cause diners to get locked in almost automatically. Hopefully it has been fixed by now, or you could end up banging on the door in futility, what with the busy staff and booming music in the restaurant."
French gastronomic experience in Singapore,"Very nice & pretty restaurant with excellent food. The steak (La cote de bouef), escargot, onion soup were delicious. Love the blue cheese & bell pepper sauce. We also ordered the halibut which was creamy & tender. The Syrah went well with the steak but overall price is a bit on the high side, be prepared to spend more than $100 per person for a good meal with 1 glass of wine. The desserts were heavenly. The creme br√ªl√©e came with a light touch of lavender aroma, the tarte au chocolat was rich, smooth & very chocolaty which eas not too sweet to my liking. One tip is to come on Wednesday to enjoy the free flow escargot at $20+ per person. Service was good & staff were friendly. Won‚Äôt mind coming back !!"
"Delicious food, warm service right in CBD","My husband and I visited the restaurant for lunch.
We shared the French onion soup, seafood stew and crepe suzette.
Each dish was delicious and done just right. Infact this was one of the best seafood stews we have had in a long time - delicately flavorful and the seafood done perfectly.
Shout out for the lovely service too.
Will definitely visit again."
Top-notch,"My friend and I had set lunch. It was a STEAL for the price.
Food quality excellent and portion generous. Service beyond expectations.
Great ambience. Special shout out to the staffs and Sri who took good care of us.
Thou the Restaurant was closing at 230pm, they did not rush us, they allowed us to take our time to enjoy our meal and coffee.
Kudos"
Awesome Dinner,It was an awesome Dinner with good food and wine. The ambient was good. The service was good. Will go again
What kind of service is this?,"Food was actually quite nice, but we waited almost 40 mins for our mains, had to follow up to realise that they just started cooking...was told the mains would be ready in 6 mins but it took them 11 mins.
And then it took them 20 mins to serve dessert which was part of the course and guess what the dessert was...tada creme bule which should already have been prepared...
The restaurant is not even understaffed. The bad service and long waiting time literally wiped out all the good food. Wouldn't come back again."
Sparkle in the old and familiar,"So this is comfort food with old classics, and seldom disappoints

This time, however, I discovered a sparkle of a starter - ‚Äúlightly torched oysters from Hyogo, chilled leek and potato, crispy tuile‚Äù

Fat, juicy, fresh Japanese oysters paired well with the creamy sauce, and delicious squid-ink tuile perfectly balanced texture and also increased the salinity and smell of the sea"
Lovely evening at L‚ÄôAngelus,"Thank you to the wonderful service and warm hospitality by Yang and Jean Charles. It was a lovely birthday evening on the terrace, we really enjoyed it, and all the best to you guys!"
Great food and service,Good selection of French dishes on the menu and the food tastes very authentic and delicious. The service is very attentive even though it was busy during a Friday lunchtime.
Cosy french eatery in town with excellent french fare,"Set menu $68 per pax served sufficient delicious food. I liked the varied selection, and I‚Äôd return to sample the others which I didn‚Äôt try today.

Escargot was $18 per pax and free flow today (Wednesdays only). They came in cute little pots and a powerful sauce and a baby bread crust on top.

I loved the rich french onion soup. Duck confit was almost perfect; a bit too salty today.

I loved the dessert too: chocolate fondant. Marvellous combination of ingredients.

Service was very attentive. Tables may be uncomfortably close to each other, though. Great backdrops for photos."
One of few good French restos in SG,"Authentic menu, good quality ingredients, delicious. The fowl is very good. Service is excellent. For anyone looking for good French food, this is one of the very few good ones in Singapore."
Dissapointed,"I‚Äôm a regular at Les Bouchons Rive Gauche where the food is consistent and great wine list. French Chef Mika is able to prepare steaks the traditional way, basting in butter, and asked me a few times to try their sister restaurant L‚ÄôAngelus.
Last night I tried the restaurant and it was a disaster. I ordered Entrec√¥te steak, and the meat was sour(border line gone bad) and was super salty, beyond edible. I wonder if the cook salted the meat to cover the sourness? There were only 2 other tables since I was there at 6 for early dinner so no excuse.
Only saving grace was the Manager Mili who tried her best to salvage the situation.
Come to think of it, recently I tried their Ann Siang restaurant and they also delivered a disappointing experience, a way undercooked steak, way rarer than a medium rare, and they had to fire it twice, by then I lost my appetite.
Next time I must find out where Chef Mika is, before I make reservation."
Great Service,Manager Chris attended to me. Professional and chatty. Provided attentive service. Great job on keeping the restaurant business up!
Great food and friendly staff,"Set lunch is a value for money, would highly recommend the place for lunch time if you're looking for somewhere nicely decorated and not so crowded."
It was a wonderful experience!,"It was a wonderful experience dining at your restaurant. The new menu eff 1 Apr is equally nice and interesting!
The escargots & warm fois gras was outstanding! Loved the crepe suzette!

Service was great from all staff, friendly and attentive to details while making the guests feel welcome and at ease.
Wine recommendation has always been excellent.
We look forward to coming back."
Decent French food!,The pate and escargots were really good but the steak was average. The rib eye was quite grainy and red wine sauce a little runnier than what I would have liked. Decent overall experience.
Excellent Service!,"The ambience was great, food was amazing! Service was on 100%, really enjoyed dinner here with my family üòç Will definitely be back for more! Special thanks to Chris for taking care of our dining needs so meticulously ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Love it,"Came here for Christmas Eve and the quail with foie gras was amazing.. and I could eat multiple rounds of escargot :D Service was fairly prompt, but the tables could be spaced out a bit more. Perhaps one area of improvement might be desserts: the crepe suzette was slightly disappointing. But overall, really glad to have found this place, will definitely be returning some time soon."
We miss the old L'Angelus,"I think our problem is we keep wishing for the L‚ÄôAngelus that existed years ago. The L‚ÄôAngelus we have today is run differently. We noticed this early last year during a dinner with family, yet decided to try it again this evening with our daughter and are sad to say we will not be returning. The staff was friendly and accommodating, but service was patchy at best. Upon arriving we were told the table we requested was reserved. In the course of our first hour there, three different parties sat at that table, but we decided it wasn‚Äôt really worth addressing given the experience we were having. Once the restaurant started to become busy, it was difficult to get waiters‚Äô attention and basic things were overlooked. It took three tries to refill our young daughter‚Äôs soda. Since she didn‚Äôt feel like eating her dinner, she agreed to share our chateaubriand at which point we were given salad plates instead of dinner plates. Our ice-cream order that meant to accompany our crepes suzette was incorrect and took a few tries to fix, at which point the crepes were cold. Cutlery was incorrect - I was given a fish fork for dessert. So many things were off and the total bill was so high and not reflective of the meal we had. Family dinners with wine tend to be expensive in Singapore, which is fine, but not when you‚Äôre agitated the whole evening about trying to reach servers, receiving incorrect orders, and then trying to correct them. To their credit, the service staff was very kind and the restaurant ended up comping our dessert for the inconvenience, which we greatly appreciated. They are not arrogant and tried to be helpful, but it was really too late for us. We miss the old L‚ÄôAngelus."
Fine dining at a great price,"Chanced upon this place while looking for a lunch spot with my husband and we were pleasantly surprised.

We had the 3 course lunch set and the mains were fantastic. I had the risotto which was perfectly seasoned. My husband had the steak frites which was super tender and the reduction was delicious.

Highly recommend if you are looking for a fine dining experience at a reasonable price."
"Nice Ambience, good food,","Nice Ambience, good food, great customer service and reasonable prices! Recommended! Will definitely return."
It‚Äôs a wonderful night,"Thumbs up to the food and wonderful service from Mili. Must try the lamb rack, escargots and creme br√ªl√©e. Thank you Mili for the attentive service and laughters shared. Special thanks to Larry for taking nice pictures for us. Everything and everyone in L‚ÄôAngelus makes our 56th monthsary celebration complete. Thank you. Will visit soon."
Saturday night!,"We went on Saturday night after work. The customer service is horrible and their part timers cannot assist us with orders and we have to wait for another staff to take our order. It's so lousy that our cutleries setting wrong. When we raised our hands, the servers ignored us. While the food runner was busy running with the foods, we asked for her help in changing the cutleries setting, she seems to know what she is doing. Sadly, our main cutleries got mixed up and we asked the servers to change for us but the servers got the wrong cutleries again. We got pissed off and the food runner drop by to check on us, she apologised and quickly changed it for us. We waited for our main for so long too. All the food was okay not as what we read on the review. Slightly disappointed. You need to teach those servers before the dinner starts to avoid this kind of circumstances. Surprisingly, towards our dessert, we were approached by the food runner. She was checking on us again, talked and laughed with us. She mentioned there was a freelow on escargots and we can't wait to come here again not on busy night. If not for her service, probably we won't ever come back. She was approachable, friendly and knowledgeable. I think she is part timer."
Wonderful tender beef,"This place always makes me comfortable, not too formal but not also too causal. The staff are nice, they serve excellent French cuisine. L'Angelus is one of my favorite restaurants."
Tasty tender flavourful beef filet mignon and cute escargot cups,Wonderful French savoir faire and friendly service. Impeccable environment that matches old world charm of French films like moulin rouge with a hip bar counter stocked with French wines.
"Fantastic service, great food, great ambience!","Went there with a couple of friends for a birthday dinner, blown away by the impeccable service from Mili! The food was top notched, between us we had the beef tartare, lamb racks, sea bass and filet mignon- all perfectly seasoned, delicious and fresh.
Really affordable & quality wine bottles too! Will definitely be back, thank you!"
Good atmosphere & delicious food,"Very cocky Frenchie atmosphere, courteous stuff and delicious food! Definitely to come back again..."
Anniversary,Good ambience. Location is a bit tough to find. Good is good for the lunch set. Service very warm n good as well
Lovely French restaurant along a quiet street,"The steak was very soft, juicy and fatty. The lamb was crispy and cooked to pinkish perfection, and the shank pie also complemented the steak. The servers were attentive and helpful and the ambience of the place charming."
Great service,"Service was probably the element that stood out throughout the dinner here. It was your usual outspoken and approachable waitstaff.

There were hits and misses for the food. Burgundy Snails ($18/6pcs) were plump and sinfully buttery and creamy. The texture of the Entrec√¥te ($40), medium rare, was slightly too rough for our liking, though. The accompanying red wine sauce, on the other hand, was probably one of the best we have had. Finally, the Seabass in Bouillabaisse Sauce ($38) was a letdown. The chef was heavy handed on the salt for both the fish and the sauce. We could also hardly detect any saffron in the bouillabaisse - which we were eagerly anticipating.

The ambience does feel like an authentic French restaurant. Dim, busy with waitstaff, and echoed with conversations."
Enjoyed our meal,Had a beautiful meal here. Enjoyed the service and food very much. A wide selection of wine available to pair with the food. Will definitely come again.
Pretty good stuff! Friendly,Pretty good stuff! Friendly staff! Oysters could have have been colder Fois gras yummy. Escargot also yummy Chateau Briand was tender and juicy. Recommend.
Great Dinner üëçüèª,"First time dining at L‚ÄôAngelus and it was for my husband‚Äôs birthday. Great ambience and friendly staffs! We had lamb rack and their specials black cod fish tasted superb. Funny enough, most of the tables occupied tonight were all celebrating birthdays and everyone joined in singing the birthday song, such an amazing crowd tonight. Dinner was enjoyable with staffs cracking jokes and making conversations with you. I definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a good french dinner. Do try their gevrey chambertly, it‚Äôs having a good promotion now and it is a very good wine."
Great ambience and heartwarming food,"The restaurant is beautifully design and very cozy, great french old town vibes. The escargots are especially delicious! (Free flow on wed!) Waiters are very attentive and friendly."
"Awesome food, great ambience and superb service",Enjoyed our visit here. Bread was served warm and the free flow escargots on Wednesday‚Äôs was an awesome surprise! Steak was good as usual
Excellent French food in a beautiful setting,"We had an enjoyable dinner at L‚ÄôAngelus. The escargot which we had for a shared starter was really delicious, possibly the best ones we‚Äôve had in Singapore. For mains, we had the lamb rack and the ribeye. Both was very well executed. We liked that the flavors were well balanced, with just enough salt to make the dishes tasty but without overwhelming the natural taste of the meat. Highly recommend the restaurant. Chris our server was excellent as well - warm and friendly and always ready with a recommendation. We will definitely return."
"Great staff, great location,","Great staff, great location, great food ! You should try the p√¢t√© and the steak tartare ! Will come again :-))"
Great Birthday Dinner!,"Celebrated my birthday here, throughly enjoyed the lamb rank and the beef tartare is a must try - different flavours in every bite! Manager was so accommodating and friendly, come visit this hidden gem!"
shockingly bad,"went last night, feel violated. This restaurant has no right to label itself as a fine dining French bistro, worse still to mislead diners with the ""Michelin"" stickers on its door which as i understand it is given to the chef who has left the restaurant.
Incredibly bad service, untrained and unknowledgeable staff, very basic wine list, and BAD FOOD. Beef quality worse than select level in US grades, cooking terrible, presentation like a canteen. Even the salad leaves were old, The French beans were brown in colour- probably hark back to the baked beans days of the cook.
wanted to celebrate a special day and took a Rousseau Chambertin 2001 there but will regret it for the rest of my life.
Noisy, zero ambience and i think caters mostly to the inebriated un-discerning of Club Street
Given French food a bad name, sad because i believe the cook is not French
Visit at your own peril"
""" a Star Restaurant""","Great service and great food, some of their dishes were fantastic.Decent price.Atmosphere was alright too due to weekend dinner im assuming. I didn't get the staff name but he was great at what he does and knows his info as well. Accommodated with all our requests professionally and humble , special thanks for the birthday treat."
Casual lunch,Very delicious set meal was served. The steak frites was very good and to die for. Certainly one of the best I have eaten. The meringue dessert was absolutely gorgeous and not too sweet.
Dinner at L Angelus,We three friend had dinner in this place. We really enjoyed the food here. Ambiance was good and the service was very nice.
Dinner,"Fantastic place with very authentic French food ! Must try fillet mignon and steak tartare and finish with crepe suzette, excellent service too ,friendly hospitable ."
Memorable birthday celebration with mother,My family and I had a fabulous time celebrating my mum‚Äôs 71st birthday at L‚ÄôAngelus. The food was flavourful. We especially enjoyed the foie gras. The ambience was cosy and welcoming. The natural lighting from the sun through the skyroof made for a very atmospheric setting in the restaurant. What impressed us most was the impeccable service where the waiters served with warmth and cheer. My mother was pleasantly surprised when the service staff complimented her with a delicious chocolate lava cake with ice-cream and spontaneously sang a birthday sing wherein the whole restaurant sang in unison! That capped the wonderful visit for us at L‚ÄôAngelus!
"Good ambience, great food",I went here with friends for dinner. Lovely place with good ambience. Amazing food! The dessert with rhubarb was just great! Some flowers would help to make it cosier
Had a fabulous meal here...,Had a fabulous meal here with a group of friends. We had lots of sharing food so I got to try a wide range from the menu. All the food was great but the steak was so tender and the rhubarb creme br√ªl√©e was amazing. Large wine menu and the staff were friendly- good atmosphere. Will book again.
Friendly service great food.,Went with a few friends for my first time at L‚Äôangelus. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The food was very impressive. Service was very attentive and the evening was fabulous. We had a wide variety from the menu which was all great. I‚Äôm definitely returning for the rissotto and steak in particular.
Amazing dinner at a very reasonable,"Amazing dinner at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended.

Shared a number of starters and mains amongst 5 ladies. Amuse-bouche was to die for, yummy little fish cake with caviar. Starters included ceviche with a yummy nutty crunch. Tomato salad, super fresh. Risotto with spinach was delicious. Mains of red snapper and C√¥te de boeuf, best I‚Äôve ever had. Meat melted in my mouth. Desserts also divine, rhubarb tarte.

French wine selection is extensive, also very well priced.

Can‚Äôt wait to go back. Booked in again next week!"
Classic french food done well.,Classic french food done well. One of the better restaurants along Club Street and reasonably priced.
Business Dinner,"Nice ambient and environment, food is good.
The serving portion is ok just nice for a person not too much.
However, location wise it is not near to any taxi stand have to walk a bit to the restaurant from main road. Waiter service is ok, friendly and focus a lot on diners."
Authentic French,"Looking for a new French restaurant we decided to try L'Angelus for lunch. We like the funky Art Deco ambience. We had the excellent set menu; our favourites were Beetroot Goat chese salad, Seared Beef fillet and the Chocolate tart. The Sancerre and the Bourgogne house poor are excellent. We will be back!"
Great place for birthday celebration!,A great restaurant to celebrate birthday! The restaurant has a great variety of wine selections. Even the house pour is very palatable. Food quality is as good as what you would expect from a French restaurant. The restaurant was very thoughtful too as they arranged a birthday fondue cake on the house!
Fine Dining in Art Deco ambience,"Beautiful Art Deco inspired interior (from ceiling to walls). Traditional French cuisine like fresh oysters, escargots, foie gras, onion soup, etc. Friendly & attentive service. Our evening did not start well because the lobster bisque and pan-fried foie gras were below our expectations, although the glass of Sancerre was lovely. We were happy with the mains - rack of lamb and pan-roasted John Dory fillets, especially the side dish of haricot beans. The best of our dishes was the cheese platter - delicious French cheeses. Total bill for 2 persons with a bottle of red wine was S$439"
Disappointing french food and service,"Usually when I go to my French restaurant, it is my usual practice to order a salad, duck confit or steak and chocolate fondue. When we visited L‚ÄôAngelus, it was no exception. The restaurant was fully booked for dinner. Their beef tartare and steak seemed popular among diners.

But we decided to try out their duck confit since it is such a common dish in French cuisine, how wrong can it go? Unfortunately, we were wrong. Some portions of my duck confit was high in salt content while my friend‚Äôs portion was evenly infused with high level of salt. The diced potatoes which complemented the dish, was also a combination of cooked ones and half-cooked ones. We gave some feedback to the waiter, who appeared patronising and told us that he would let the Chef know about this. But he did not come back to us. The greens in the salad was awfully bitter. The chocolate fondue cake was incorrectly paired with a sour fruity ice-cream, and this ruined the dessert. Maybe it was unfortunate that the food we ordered just weren‚Äôt the restaurant‚Äôs signatures?

Honestly, I have visited many French bistros and restaurants in Paris and other parts of France, which are much better. In our own personal opinions, we also thought that the other French restaurant which we previously visited various times, on the other side of Chinatown, took more pride in serving French cuisine more seriously and consistently than this one. We thought we will try out the popular L‚ÄôAngelus that evening for a birthday celebration but we were disappointed. We probably won‚Äôt come back here again."
Great meal with attentive service,"First time for us here at L‚ÄôAngelus, despite having lived in Sing for over four years. Found the food to be excellent and the service just as good - will definitely be going back as it was an instant fave. We were very happy that it felt less like a stuffy, formal restaurant and more like a bistro too."
Nice ambiance and food too,"This was an impromptu dinner decision following a hankering for a cassoulet dinner, L'Angelus being near the office. Reservation made easily enough online. Kicked off proceedings with a ""Grande Ferme"" salad with roquefort cheese and bacon. The portion overall could have been more generous, as we struggled to find the bacon bits. The onion soup was tasty, and so was the highlight, the cassoulet of Toulouse. The meat portions were satisfactory but a personal preference would have been the version from Castelnaudary, without the tomato base, just pure stewed white beans. We ended with 2 desserts, a chocolate fondant paired with an extremely tangy raspberry sorbet for the missus, and the classic cr√®me brul√©e in tandem with rhubarbe puree. Cannot fault either one, both were good and an excellent way to top off the dinner. This is not a bistro style eatery so expect to fork out a fair bit for a dinner for 2. A personal recommendation would be to share the cassoulet as it is extremely rich, unless you have been starving a day in advance!"
Disappointing,"I was used to regularly go to L‚Äôang√©lus and really appreciated the ambiance, service and obviously traditional French cuisine quality.
However, the last experience there was really disappointing with major items on the menu being not available (and waitress admitting it has been the case for some time) and quality of food itself going down although prices remain on the high side.
On top of that, although having given feedback to management (and same applies to one of my friends who was there on that evening), they don‚Äôt seem to even bother to answer ...
The positive thing is that there are many other good French restaurants in Singapore."
Awesome ambience and food!,"My boyfriend and i went to celebrate our anniversary there, and maybe cause it was a Monday, the restaurant was not super crowded and the ambience was great. It was dim and quite cosy. We had escargots for appetizer and it was really good, possibly one of the best escargots we've eaten. I had the dinner set meal while my boyfriend had steak, and we enjoyed our dinner greatly! Would definitely visit again to try their ala carte items more."
Superb high-end French,"Great ambience. Not too large dining room. Feels authentic.
All the French standards feature on the a la carte menu,plus there‚Äôs a $$68++ set menu.
Our party had escargots,terrine,beef carpaccio followed by steaks,sea bass and coq au vin.
All were good,washed down with Chablis and Gigondas.
A lovely evening."
Disappointing,"Did not quite live up to being the oldest single-location French Restaurant. The soup was bland, the mains were also not impressive- pieces of duck that looked more like zhi char. And pannacota served in a wine glass? Didn‚Äôt taste very authentic at all. Should have included French onion soup at the very least."
Good solid steaks.,Ordered the steak with foie gras. Delicious. 10/10 would recommend. Fantastic service to boot. Will definitely return.
Wonderful meal as usual with good value set dinner,"Came for dinner with wife and daughter. My wife and I had the set dinner, and the portions are very generous and the food the usual good quality. Service was attentive and water was constantly refilled. Food pacing was ok though could be slightly faster. Nice complimentary bread and butter. Always one of my favourite French bistro"
Best food and experience during Valentine‚Äôs Day period,"The food are very delicious. We ordered French Onion soup, Escargot soaked in olive oil and tomato pur√©e with a small toasted bread on top. The Ribeye is so delicious and filling. The atmosphere is the best for couple to celebrate. The service staff and very polite and professional."
Fabulous French Food!,"A lovely dinner in beautiful surroundings of a Parisienne Caf√©. Felt as if we were dining in Paris not Singapore!
I enjoyed excellent Escargots, then one of the best Dover Sole ever - finishing with Cr√™pes Suzette no less! Washed down with a glorious Chassagne Montrachet.
The service was impeccable. A great find."
Brilliant French inspired food and atmosphere,"We used to go to this restaurant a lot when I lived in Singapore. 6 years later we decided on a revisit on a Friday evening. Club Street was heaving and very noisy. Inside the restaurant it is calm, low level music and a great French atmosphere. We ordered pate and goats cheese starters, followed by duck breasts and rump steak. We had a carafe of cotes du Rh√¥ne. The food arrived quickly and portions were fairly generous. Up to remembered standard! Yes it is quite expensive, but well worth it."
Relaxed convivial atmosphere with lovely food.,"A beautiful place, a converted shophouse with lots of French posters, photos and plants. Excellent service and food. I had the speciality of the house, snails, which were wonderfully garlicky, followed by magret de canard, perfect, then the highlight of the crepes Suzette, made perfectly at our table. A very memorable evening with great food, wine and ambience. Thank you !"
Just so-so,Set menu was good value. Champagne by the glass was tiny and somewhat flat. Jazz music was too loud in a small restaurant like that. Food was average compared to my previous visit
Surprise find and a real gem,Ok late review we stumbled on Club Street as it was near to our hotel..yes I know every visitor to Singapore knows about Club street..anyway we were struck by the intriguing nature of this place and had great French Brasserie style food with excellent service
A beautiful experience of authentic french food and wine in Spore. üç∑,"This place is hands down, one of the best i have been to in Spore. Whether it comes to the delicious food, the pleasant staff, or the location it is set up in. I have had the best experience with french food here. A must try here would be the duck liver pate, absolutely fav!"
Impeccable service and great desserts,We spent 2 dinners at L'Angelus . We loved the atmosphere and the French feel of this restaurant. Lovely friendly service team makes your dinners very enjoyable. The crepe suzette and pistacco icecream and brandy cherry are must try!!
The Magic of the Chef,"The Chef has magical fingers. The food and desert was simply amazing. Had a great dining expereince in a very nice , relaxed and welcoming setting."
Enjoyable evening,"We had the 3 course dinner set. The food was good though more rustic compared to other French restaurants on the usual SG list, and the seafood stew I had was not what I expected. Service was warm, friendly, impeccable. Ambience was nice and cozy, conducive to a long leisurely dinner. The staff made the birthday dinner memorable. I would dine here again."
Very french menu,"This restaurant has really a french menu. Mainly focus on meat. Long french wine list. Service is good as they properly take care just take time to serve is long. Food is ok a little bit priced,"
A hearty meal,"Location is great, food was good, plentiful and very satisfying. Sat out the front and was approached by a few street vendors selling flowers, however this was fine. Definatly worth stopping by for dinner."
A Memorable French Restaurant,"We had a small diner with 8 people and it was fantastic. I will certainly be back for a few reasons. Firstly, the atmosphere and service was very good. It's low key and comfortable without being too over the top. Secondly, the menu. It has a wide representation of French food and traditional dishes.
We had 2 French nationals in our group and they were suitably impressed."
Memorable dining experience,Had dinner with family. Excellent food and great ambience. Wonderful service without being intrusive. Highly recommended.
a dinner to remember,"we went for dinner as my daughter likes to have a french cuisine after her graduation. the food is excellent, the wine is good, the service is good, staff are attentive to your needs and willing to explain if need. my graduate has the nicest dessert ever, her creme br√ªl√©e"
Memorable romantic restaurant with unexpected delightful cuisine and wine,"I have since rebooked for our next trip to Singapore- it really feels like an authentic regional restaurant in France- totally unexpected. Excellent produce used in great dishes, with great service."
Eclectic French Cuisine,"This restaurant was recommended by a friend. The wine selection was phenomenal. The service was impeccable. The food Was delicious. Overall, when in Singapore, I would experience it again."
One of my favorite French restaurants!,"I have been a couple of times to this restaurant and I was happy with their food every time. Food was tasty and quite generous portion, specially cheese. There was a good selection of wine and reasonable price. Staff were polite and attentive. It was quite relaxed ambience too, one of my favorite French restaurants in Singapore."
Never disappoints!,"We go for special occasions, this was our silver wedding anniversary. We were offered complimentary champagne on arrival which was very thoughtful. We both had onion soup which was absolutely stunning. My wife had seabass and I had ribeye with gratin dauphinois and pepper sauce. We both had crepes suzette which were just gorgeous, every bite was so delicious. We finished with calcados and Amaretto.. A perfect evening with great service and warm ambiance. We'll be back many more times"
Quality French restaurant,"If you are looking for good French food without burning a hole in the pocket, look no further. Located in the lively Club Street area, the restaurant is reminiscent of a typical quaint Paris restaurant. The quality of food was good as was the service."
"Delicious food with a great service, I felt like a princess!","A French restaurant in Singapore with this quality is something I‚Äôve never seen before! It was an authentic french kitchen, like in the old days, amazing. The service was also really great! Compliments to the whole team, I enjoyed my evening! Thanks!"
Disappointing for lunch,Shockingly slow service for the set menu. Inexplicable. The food was half decent provided you could wait an hour for it to arrive. Many better places....
Good French bistro dinner,"Came here for my wife's birthday dinner, though we didn't tell the restaurant since she likes it low-key.

We had
- Mixed green salad with roquefort blue cheese and bacon
- Pan-Fried Dover Sole, Butter Lemon Sauce, Steamed Potatoes
- Cassoulet (Meats And Sausages, Served With Duck Confit And Pork Belly)
- Hot Chocolate Cake

Mixed salad is good quality, though nothing spectacular. Nice Roquefort.

The cassoulet is always my favourite, and it's enough to feed 2 persons (that's me). If you like baked beans, this would be for you. Doubly so if you like meats, as it as duck confit, pork belly and loads of sausages. 80% of the time it's done well, though on another occasion I felt that the meats were a bit tough.

The dover sole was very good, though it never comes cheap (in any restaurant in Singapore). With the butter sauce it was fantastic.

Chocolate cake nice enough, though I prefer the ""lava"" type where it oozes out instead of just being liquidy.

All in all a very good meal again (though it would have been 4 stars during my second visit, per my earlier comment about the tougher meat in the cassoulet)."
OK experience,"Chose this place due to it's French atmosphere, which I find quite original. The rest was average, crowd started to build up after 8.30pm."
Friday nights !,"Not very often do you get Value & Authentic French food .. this place is a must try. From the wines to the food, & Desserts to the warm and happy hosts, it‚Äôs a place you will go back time and again!"
White Asparagus,"Walked in for a business lunch, we got a good sized table. It had the upscale ambience that was conducive to good conversation. Had the snapper which was terrific. my friend was vegetarian and got a special menu which was a good suprise at a proper French restaurant. White asparagus was a delight.
Great red wine list including some verticals, though being lunch we did not imbibe.

Will be back"
Charming French restaurant on Club Street!,"What started off as a meeting place for a group of 4 couples, ended up being a fantastic evening in this charming restaurant. The entrance is quite charming but placid and doesn't quite prepare you for the interiors. As we entered, we were absolutely delighted with the warm interiors! The bar is quite close to the entrance which is presumably meant for patrons waiting to be seated, but we did see casual walk-ins as the evening progressed. We found their French wine collection to be very extensive! The posters on the walls also made the whole restaurant very warm and cosy.

I think the complimentary warm bread rolls went down perfectly with the wine along with the butter that was served with it. The goat cheese salad deserves a special mention among the entree selections. In the mains, we shared the pan seared sea bass, pan fried Dover sole (both excellent!), marinated lamb racks (done to perfection as requested by one in our group), and the roasted chicken in a cream sauce was superb. One of our friends was vegetarian and they rustled up delightful plate of vegetables (see foto below).

While we ordered both the creme br√ªl√©e and the Warm chocolate cake, it was really the chocolate one which was the winner! It was truly fabulous as they claim it to be."
Best French meal in Singapore,"Went for dinner to L‚ÄùAngelus and came away in love with the ambiance, service, wine and lip smacking delicious food . When you enter through the doors you feel transported to a Parisian Cafe in Paris. The decor is very warm and inviting and David who runs the place immediately makes you feel at home. I had the pate as my starter, Dover sole as my main course and their warm chocolate lava cake ( the first one in Singapore apparently) all were beyond delicious. Even the butter they serve is awesome. I would def visit as there is a reason this restaurant which is the first French restaurant in Singapore is still in business and doing so well."
Fabulous little French restaurant,"We had dinner here on 2 of our 4 nights in Singapore. Excellent menu with just enough variety to the fixed menu (5 options for each serving) at an excellent $68 each.
Entree options were excellent with a special mention to the goat cheese salad. Yummy.
Tuna steaks with sesame seed coating were our favourite main though the second night they were a bit cool.
Dessert was fabulous and the bread as it should be in a French restaurant was superb.

All up a lovely restaurant and well worth a visit."
Nice evening,"As we walked along Club street looking for a place to have dinner - we ended up at the porch at L'Angelus - eating a delicious french meal - instead of a nice Chinese dinner - as we had planned to do. They served us a delicious sole meuniere - (not even on the menu...) - - and the wine list was impressive.
The guests at the neighbouring table were locals - and admitted they ate at the L'Angelus quite often - as one of their favourite restaurants in Singapore. We understand why...

( service very friendly - and a very ""french"" interior - if that matters..)"
"competitively priced lunch menu, food OK-lah","+ SGD 39 for a three course set lunch incl coffe in the CBD is a good, competitive offer.
+ restaurant is decorated bistro-style in a renovated shop house.
+ service is friendly and attentive

- cold cut starter plate: good variety, but why do I need to visit a restaurant to just get sliced meat without any salad, or pate or something special?
- steak: very strange texture, felt a bit like soaked in meat softener, somehow real beef texture missing
- potatoes: not cooked enough
- cr√®me brule: felt like being ""sitting"" in the fridge for a very long time
- only two tables busy ...

would I go again? NOPE, simply too much choice around the corner"
Classic French Cuisiine,An institution of Singapore We went for the steak tartare and were not disappointed The restaurant was quiet but is was Tuesday night Well worth a visit when in Singapore
Walk in dinner,"First of all, the food was good but the service from the female petite manager was really below average. This is my first time having a meal in a local restaurant that i felt i was actually in a foreigner country. Is kind of disappointing that it happened in our own country and is not surprised that the manager is actually a Singapore citizen herself. She has an attitude problem and the best part is towards her own people."
