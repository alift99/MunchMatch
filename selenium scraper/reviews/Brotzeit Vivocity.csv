Good service and always love it there,Regular dining places as the service and food are good while the kids can play around outside the restaurant and we are still able to keep an eye on them.
Good,"Everything good, good atmosphere, good food, good service. Come for pork knuckle, for my own opinion not salty enough"
Make reservations before going,"Make reservations before going. We came here on late Sunday night and the line was insane. We thought about just skipping it but decided to come back later after shopping and there was no longer a line. Food was good, considering we've tried another German restaurant here in Singapore. We had the goulash soup, curry bratwurst with chips, platter and pretzel with sweet mustard sauce and waittress spoke German which made the experience more authentic. If you have a craving for German, this is the place to come to."
Excellent food and service,Second time visiting. My family enjoy this place and always looking forward to the next visit. Food is excellent and so is their service. Big portion was big too! Great for families and friends gathering
Wonderful Experience,It was my first time there and the restaurant has a good team of staff. One of the male server was extremely helpful. Unfortunately I didn't get his name. Overall it was a wonderful experience and I will be back again.
Average,"Second visit, the kasekrainer pork-cheese sausage was okay, a bit too salty for me. The fried grated potatoes were also okay, although a bit too oily. Ambience okay and normal customer service."
Brotzeit VivoCity booking,The Booking is quick and easy. Smooth. upon arrival the staff at brotzeit already had reserved the table. There was no waiting time
Fantastic range of amazing German food and beers/cocktails/wines.,"Fantastic range of amazing German food and beers/cocktails/wines. Lovely platters and excellent chuicken/pork duo dishes. Outdoors is perfect location to work, watch the world go by, meet up with friends and chill. Highly recommended."
Birthday Gathering with friends,"Excellent service by Fendy from receiving us till the end. Gracious as ever as we remember the team: staff members helped store the cake (bought from elsewhere) in the fridge & appeared with new plates, cutlery & even a lighter when serving the cake . As it was a busy Friday evening, we were politely told that we had our table till 8pm. Not a problem for us. There was a long line waiting outside for a while. Thank you, Fendy & team!"
Average,"First visit, first time eating German sausage. The farmer's sausage together with the fried grated potatoes were okay. The salzstangerl and obatzda with the cheese spread, nothing special, two pieces of ordinary bread. cheese was too salty for me, at SGD8 not worth it.

Ambience okay but customer service was good, friendly guy."
Great experience after COVID restrictions were lifted,"We did a gathering of 17 people, with business colleagues from multiple countries. It was a great experience. Food, drinks, service, ambience were all excellent."
Best roast pork knuckle.,"It must have been a great experience except with the front desk rep (Shaun) which we found rude and disregarding.
Eric and another young girl on the other hand were both respectful and attentive. Excellent customer service.
We might have rated this branch 5 of 5, except the experience with Shaun. We understand that we have to Q and wait in line for 1.5hrs because there were 3 of us. Although all diners of 2 behind us were able to get their tables. It's Shaun's rude behaviour that disappointed us. He must have been tired though. And if that's the case, maybe rotate him with someone."
SLOW SERVICE,"The food is so-so and service is terrible. We placed our order at 1:15pm and waited for 1 hour and 30min before our food was served. My friends and I were extremely famished. Had my friend not followed up after an hour, they would not have started preparing our order in the kitchen. They told us to wait for 2min and after 2min, only the side dishes came. We waited another 30min. It was a nightmare. Although the manager gave us free pints of beer, I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN. Brotzeit Vivo City is the worst restaurant I’ve been to in Singapore."
"Solid German favorite, best roasted potatoes!","Visot d broitzeit twice in the last two months and the food has been great. So glad that the quality has held over the years.

Tried the sausage platter for two on one occasion and then the larger larger with the pork knuckle on another. I always have to get a side of soft buttery spatzle which is always fantastic.

Kudos for the. Sausages being lovely and the roasted potatoes being AMAZING. I have noticed however that now regular dill pickles are served instead of the nicer and better quality smaller cornichons.

Service has been friendly and prompt and we will be back to try the currywurst and other newer items."
Eric is impressive service staff with bright smile.,"We have not enter restaurant, a gloomy chinese looking staff led us to our table outdoor. When we change table ,he seemed unhappy looks. He seems to have comfort of working in aircon indoor area.. But he has no greetings..No smiles.. No passion.

However this Filipino senior staff name eric (i hope its correct) , was always smiling and humour us in the sweltering heat of outdoor sunny day.

He even initiated gave us wipes to clean our dirty hands besides serviettes given...

I was not keen on joining memberships.. But his service encourages me to..

I wish there is many more staff of his calibre to make this restaurant comfortable to dine with..

Food was average pizza and not huge portion..Too little in my great appetite.

Bratwurst was tasty my partner tasted it.

Tiramisu latte was top notch.."
"Great food, good service",We ordered the famous Schnitzel- pork n chicken n one roasted knuckle. Food was served hot n prompt. Delicious indeed. Service was attentive. More than enough portions to share. Good dinner indeed! Must try.
Ambience can be deceiving,"My family surprised me for my 54th birthday in Brotzeit (Vivo City) branch. At this time, pandemic restrictions are eased up so this is a 1st time dinner at this place for my family of 5. Que was bad but service from attending staff made everything less comfortable. Thumbs up for the excellent service by the Crew/Waiters and they will attend to you repeatedly without asking their attention. Food and Drinks was served fast and is properly presented. The Beers are good and well matched with our Meaty Dinner. The prices overall was fair & well worth it. BUT, what ""damaged"" my whole Birthday affair was when we were given seats outside the restaurant, despite making an early reservation. Because it was a humid/hot evening, we expected to be seated inside (with Aircon), but even when asked (2x) that we are not comfortable with outside seating, the crew came up with reasons like: Tables were already reserved or Sorry sir, it will ""mess up"" the reservation order (whatever that means). Given the ""situation"", we accepted to be seated outside. BUT, it would be more pleasant if they anticipated to setup Blowers/Fans to cool our area (abt 7 tables including ours). It was also quite dark that u require to illuminate your menu list. Brozeit Vivo City, please look into this if you want more satisfied clients and expect them to return with more client prospects. I would like to give this a POOR rating, if not for the excellent service from your staff."
Excellent German Bistro,"Brotzeit has maintained a consistent service and quality of food, with great seasonal menus. This time we had roasted goose, which is a rarity in itself but also well executed. The sausage platter is a staple for my visits, and I particularly praise the quality of their sauerkraut and pickles, which taste very authentic. All in all, a great restaurant, no matter which outlet."
Dinner at Broitzeit,Food was delicious and enjoyed it very much! Staff were friendly and accommodating. We requested to move to a table further within the restaurant as the cigarette smell from the outdoor area was coming into the indoor area as the door was not shut. It would have been perfect if we didn’t have to endure the second hand smoke.
Visit to Brotzeit,"Nice food , ambience, crowded at times. Better make reservations in advance so that there’s table available . Been visiting Brotzeit for many years . Though serving staff keep renewing , service standard is still there . Kudos to the management who train the staff well….well done …cheerrrs"
Excellent service and food,"Checking in via SafeEntry was easy and showing our vaccination status was a breeze. Service was excellent, and the food very good! It would've been even better if the rye bread had been toasted and warm. All in all, it was a satisfying meal and we'll be coming back!"
"Nice ambience, spacious.",Staff was not very attentive but service was satisfactory. Pork knuckle was quite dry & tough so it was disappointing as I went there just for that.
Billing,"I bought the Chope voucher for 150 and they only allowed me to use 100 dollars and they said i cant use all. since i was the guest i did not argue and left the place having the balance amount from the voucher i purchased. (by billing came around 145 SGD, i remember correctly)"
Chilling,"Very good place to enjoy. Service is very good. You should find a place outside…amazing. Food is very good, enjoy the lager beer."
Average experience,"We have been to this VivoCity Brotzeit three times. Each time, we have had 5-star experiences, but today’s service could have been better. We came as a party of five today, including two children under 12.

We were served mostly by Diana and two Evelyns. In general, the service was impersonal and transactional. The former made it very clear that we could only use one Burpple offer by showing us the fine print. The non-bespectacled Evelyn was the friendliest of the lot and was alert to clear our table a few times. Diana came to save us when we had a table spillage.

We ordered the full Ribs (half Smokey half Bavarian honey), 1-metre cheese sausages, barramundi pasta and special salat. The smokey half of the ribs came a little too burnt at the ends but was still good, pasta good as per usual and cheese sausages delicious!

A fair experience this time round as we missed the welcoming, friendly and conversant manager Steven."
Good dining place for friends and family,"Enjoyed the good service despite a full house. The food was delicious, well plated and was served in good portions relative to the price. The Chope voucher is a good deal with 25% discount. The staff deserve commendation as they remembered orders and requests even while bussing tables. Very well organised.

Ordered the sausage platter which was ample for 2 sausage lovers. The meat platter with pork knuckle was good too! But surprisingly the cheese spaetzle was a delicious blend of cheese and egg pasta. Nice complement to the meats. Salads were nice especially the super salad with a light tasty dressing."
Fresh Oysters,"Nothing much to say, very fresh Oysters exellent quality and taste. Herefor 5 Stars, the Brotzeit Change offers pretty nice food and beer which is a bit overpriced compare to all branches in the neibourhodds .
Herefor only 3 Stars. What I like personal is to sit at Harbor Front and see the water. Staff is great food agian for me average."
Good place for group meals,"A good place to enjoy a meal with a group of friends. Food portion is reasonable, though the pork knuckle was a little on the dry side. We really enjoyed the rosti and the German version of Mac ‘n’ Cheese. Overall, nice ambience and good food."
Standards dropped so low!,"WTF!!! Served leftovers???!!!
Brought my family here for dinner last Saturday, 23 Jan 2021. Used to be one of my favourite places for beers and ribs... but standards have dropped and sank below the Straits of Singapore seas!!! The ribs that we were served were harder than those on trucks tyres! I am really f**king disappointed! I complained to the waitress, but she mumbled something and ran away! Un-f**king-belivable! For a price we paid over $240 for 4 pax, we expect not to be served last weeks re-heated leftover ribs!
Not recommended!
Not going back anytime soon!"
Grreat food and service,Staff was very friendly and helpful with our requests. Food and services were awesome! Will definitely come back again.
Go easy for Meet-up,"Though they do not have a wide selection of items, it is adequate for typical social get together, with snacks and lager before everyone arrives, German platters for sharing as well as personal portions. The food are great for conversations. I will recommend to go straight for the platters and snacks. As they say, ""Sharing is Caring"". Not to forget the German Beer from the Barrel."
Compliments for work well done for Vivo Brotzeit,"We had an enjoyable time. great service by your staff. Food was delicious too. It was a breeze from making reservation to entering the restaurant. The staff has also taken note of the request for indoor seating. We would like to commend the good service by your staff - Roslinda (known more as Linda). She was warm, enthusiastic and friendly. We will be happy to be back."
epic brunch even for vegetarians....and great service too,"on a busy Sunday we enjoyed a fantastic brunch here:

- my kids had free brunch
- my wife had oyster brunch plus the normal one
- i had the holiday champagne/beer brunch although as a vegetarian I always have to be creative and ask for fish/meat to be taken off the dishes as they don't do many vegetarian dishes

- after initially taking a while the service was fast and wisely instead of giving me champagne by a glass at a time with the delays that would entail they just gave me the bottle even though it's a brunch/freeflow - pragmatic

everything else came quickly and everyone was happy and enjoyed a great time outside watching the world go by

great work but please do more vegetarian options"
"Good food and beer. Ling,the","Good food and beer. Ling,the hostess, was very kind and helpful. She gave us a table as we have no reservations but need to return the table in 90 mins. However, she managed to get us an empty table that allowed us to continue through the night. She is wonderful!"
Enjoyable experience,"Despite covid, the staff were very amazing and pleasantly hosting the customers with great hospitality especially the guest relation office her name was LING. She were seen handling most of the customers with her warmth and sincerity and most importantly made us feel at home. Will definitely recommend this restaurant to all as its a great place to chill.."
"good food, service and ambience for dinner date","Early celebration for New Years. Place was rather crowded as expected, but staff was very responsive. Special shoutout to Ling for helping us get a good outdoors table with a waterfront view. Food was good and promptly served - staff were efficient, responsive and friendly. Price is a bit costly (which was expected) but we would consider it good value. Would come again."
Had a great time out to cool,"Had a great time out to cool off 2020. Filled with laughters and very friendly staff. Special shout out to GRO Ling, who helped us throughout. 🙏"
Excellent service and good food,Service staff (Ling) provide excellent service. And of cos good foods and beers... Will visit again.
"Food, check. Drinks, check","Ordered delivery from this place a few times but nothing beats the freshness of dining in. The food is great, the drinks are great, and the service, excellent."
Perfect Dinner,The german manager accommodates us so warmly. Very informative and fun to talk with. We enjoyed the food and had so much fun with the ambiance. We will definitely go back here. Beers are amazing.
My birthday,Great ambience great food great service when we didn't say anything they adjusted the beer barrel for us overall great experience
Birthday celebration,"First of all, I would like to say that we had a wonderful time at Vivo Brotzeit. Kudos to the team of Allen, Ling and Ian who made our night a wonderful and joyous Celebration. Secondly, I would like to compliment the crew of Allen, Ling and Ian of their outstanding service where they made us feel at home with their “happy teamwork” Finally, I would like to say that coming back to Vivo Brotzeit is definitely a yes and I would strongly recommend Vivo Brotzeit to enjoy the food, ambience and service with your loved ones. Cheers"
Pleasant Experience,"We were a party of 4 and had a good time at the restaurant. From the seating down on our day (Ling), server giving good suggestions (Evelyn) to the Manager serving our main courses. They were a great team & doing a marvellous job. Handling customers with no reservations and trying to find them a table. Special mention of Ling who was also extra friendly towards all her customers with salutations and of yes, her eyes sparkled with a smile. Kudos to the team! Will visit again for sure!!"
Fabas usual!,We always find it impossible to get a table - precisely because the food and ambience is fab as usual! Booking through chope was simple and efficient. (only issue was that our message didn't get noticed. was celebrating a birthday this time but we had to remind the service staff)
Biased server,We had friends who came inside first but the server at the entrance acted blur and was like: “Where? Where are your friends?” although we pointed clearly to them. And there were 3 people behind us but they got in first and we had 45 minutes. In the end we left. wtf.
Casual lunch,"No frills, the app was rather complicated for the staff to integrate and add to the bill, but otherwise worked in the end.

Food wise was OK, pork knuckle was rather dry, maybe I've not visited Brotzeit recently and quality may have changed. Sauerkraut was also dry and not the usual standard. Roasted potatoes were good, but lukewarm and the edges appeared more crusty than normal. Otherwise the service was decent, and atmosphere for lunch was relaxed and comfortable."
Good German Food - good beer,Good German Food - good beer selection and the pork chop and pork schnitzel were good meals and the creamy mushroom sauce was great but a larger serving of sauce would have been great.
Place to go for German food,This is the place to go if one is craving for some German food. Many selections available but my personal favourite is still the German sausages available here. Alfresco dining available facing the sea. Relaxing and chill atmosphere.
Good Food Good Beer,Their Food come with big portion with acceptable price. and taste very Good. Pork Knuckle is recommended. Beer also good.
Tasty food but service a little slow,We came here for lunch yesterday and opted for a main each. I had the farmer’s sausage whilst my friend opted for the salmon rosti. The food was great but the service was quite slow: took around 40 mins to arrive.
Nice food and service team,"We didn't order much food but we loved the sausages, spinach flatbread pizza and wedges. Staff were busy running around but they were friendly and sincere towards us when attending to us."
healthy and wide range of western dishes!,"Although not on the low end of the cuisine market, its brunch with free flow of selected high quality dishes at $38++ per adult served by courteous waiters and waitresses is a good weekend wholesome deal!"
Great food slow stuff,If service was a bit motivated to work I would have given 5 stars. They are annoyingly slow. Wish to see improvement
Prost!,"This is the place to go when one wants good fresh German beer. My favouriste is Franziskaner Dunkel (roasted wheat malt beer), refreshing, cream, fruity all in one. Ordered Farmer's sausage to go along. It came with pickled beetroot and pan fried potatos. The taste blend so well with each other. Kid can order from kid menu @$10."
Sad,"Weve been in the exact same branch a couple of times and we were happy unfortunately last night was such a waste of time food and money. We used to love it as its very close to our house. Food quality before was great service was fast and reliable. Last night was a different story they were not busy but everything was just so bad.

Service: everyone seems like they just wana keep running going no where. The cashier who is a familiar face we always see everytime we come never change but she just love to ignore the needs shame as she looks like shes a senior a supervisor or something. The head chef keeps going in and out of the kitchen and keeps going in and out of the restaurant makes you feel like theres something wrong then the other chefs too follows and do the same makes us think whos working.

Food: we ordered ribs and it was so tough inedible it tasted overcooked then microwaved it says in the menu it comes with sauerkraut none came we tried hard to eat it as we were starving we just cant good thing we have beer and wine. The pretzels seems consistently good thought thats why i gave a star.

Hopefully they can do something about it we did love the place but not coming back anymore maybe we try other branch."
Short stop while walking around Habourfront,I was there for a beer when I was wandering around in Habourfront. It was a nice bar with a nice view directly to the bay and Sentosa island. Staff were very friendly and it was really nice to have a small talk with them
Christmas Day with dinner at Brotzeit,"Had an excellent time here at Brotzeit with a group of 10, for Christmas day dinner. Fantastic service especially from Jean. Great food everything from sausage platters to healthy salmon salads and wide beverage selection, with the addition of the fabulous view of the waterfront over to Sentosa. Highly recommended."
Lovely place overlooking harbour,The restaurant offers good fare of German fare. Wurstelplatte a platter of sausages n Gebackene Garnelen were delicious. HB Weiss n Schneider beer were good. View of harbour from restaurant was superb.
Bad excuse,Went for lunch on weekday. My husand ordered one of the german sausages and asked for it to be cooked well done. It came pale white. We questioned why and they said it comes pre cooked and they do not cook it more. They could have told us when we ordered. We would not have stayed. Will not be back.
Dinner at Brotzeit,The only disappointing part of this visit is that the restaurant seems to be short of staffs. It took time to get attention of a service crew to request for kids cutlery etc.
Yummy costly German food,Pros Authentic German cuisine Just nice portions as restaurant is serious about avoiding food wastage Friendly servers Cons High prices
Birthday Dinner,"Good ambience, good service but foods average. Presentation of foods were good. The restaurant is short of manpower to clear the table despite of desserts being served."
Great gathering place,"their beer and sausage are really great, good restaurant atmosphere, strongly recommended for family and friends gathering!"
Awesome fellowship location,"The staff, food and atmosphere were great. They offer to explain the menu and provided us options before we order."
Great food. Terrible Service,"Sausages and Schnitzel were excellent. The wine could have been colder but none-the-less delicious. The service however, Not friendly, definitely not in tune with the customers. Forgetful. I understand if someone is having a bad day - but if you don't give a s**t, then it's time to change profession. ...and then adds on a 10% service charge. WTF? We didn't have time to argue over that. Next time we want German food, we'll be at Marche..."
Just like Germany,"Whilst visiting Singapore we came upon this fantastic restaurant, so decided to try it. Food was amazing, so appetising, nearest I’ve had to proper German food since working there many years ago, I would highly recommend this lovely restaurant."
Birthday celebration at Brotzeit,"Arranged for a dinner celebration at Brotzeit with my family of 10. All in all, food was good, service was great. Only downside was that there was a Oktoberfest promotion going on which just started not long ago, it was only 6:15pm that day and there were a few platters that was not available/ sold out already. That was a disappointment."
Typical German cucine.,Located inside the mall. The staff was friendly. The menu has plenty of meals to choose including combos. The prices were ok for the Singaporean standards only the beers were a little bit expensive as everywhere in Singapore. I paid 35€ for a meal and 1L beer.
Amazing food!!,Food was good. Friendly staff. Restaurant can get very crowded during peak hours so do remember make reservations. We had early dinner so restaurant was less crowded. Great place to hang out with family and friends.
Nice Food,"Food was good, but female staff was rude. The female waitress was impatient when placing order and couldn't give recommendation on the wide variety of beer."
Great beer but poor sevice,"Poor service attitude... the server was impatient in taking orders and looked like we were causing inconvenience to her while we were trying to decide our order... it was not just to us that she had a bad attitude but other patrons as well.

Beer was great as usual but the Fladen was abit too dry and crust was abit burnt. Would stick to ordering Sausages and Rosti on my next visit, if there is any ."
Great place to eat and have good time!,"Excellent food quality, fair offer of wine and tasty German cousin. Selection of meal is great and all is prepared upon order. Place can be crowded but it is for all good places - just common. I like cheese sausage but pork knuckle is just good as in Germany :-)
My recommendation!"
Makan session,"Nice environment, nice food, good location. Will arrange another gathering with my friends to go back there again."
Food was good!,"Had a lovely lunch at Brotzeit - food was good and atmosphere was good! However, service could be slightly better as it was difficult to get the servers' attention even though the restaurant was not crowded."
food is good,visited with my friend and the food was so amazing! beers are great. although waited for sometime. but its all good
Low quality of altitude,We have seated by waiter to our prefer seat but without menu for us to order food and drinks until we have to wave waiter to serve us the menu. But very disappointed that the first question being asked is do we make reservation? Also the another waiter helping on order actually give very impatient altitude.
Bad Service,"Slow in service, waitresses are not attentive even the place is not crowded. They tend not to look at customers when we called for service."
Good beer,Good options for food and beer is very good! My family enjoy the food and my wife also the variety of beer. Must visit in Singapore and good to try the beer.!
Super food,Food platters were amazing. Service was amazing. So glad we were outside because as we walked thru the inside it was so super hot. Thanks for a great night.
Photo-worthy Beer Jugs,"I was with a friend fr China and wanted to introduce german food and beer to him.

I must say the Beer Jugs are instagram-worthy, and it does open up a lunch conversation, but you can’t bring them home. Food was not too bad and service was so-so, as you can imagine, it was a packed Sunday lunch at Vivocity.

The pork knuckle is not easy to eat so I suggest to order it only for the experience...3 of us ordered 2 different dishes and didnt finish our food.

Overall an authentic German sausage experience. Restaurant was not too noisy so it was OK for chatting."
Recommended Bistro to chill,"The overall experience in terms of food, service and pricing was good highly recommended for ppl to organizing small group gathering or chill with friends.

If i have to give an area of improvement, what i can think there will be two. First to revise the price lower to benefit all customer, who dont want cheap n good food hahaha. Next to consider install more cooler to made the area more cosy as singapore recent weather is terribly hot which really affect our appetite."
big yummy portions for reasonable price,"at VIVO you can sit indoor or outside (smoking). we had a platter with veal vienna, pork knuckle and different kind of sausages. wow, huge portion even for 4 people. very delicious. service is friendly and fast. value for money."
Terrible sassy waitresses and appalling service,"We always love Brotzeit as it’s reliably great German food at awesome value. We are always there for the platters.

It was my son’s birthday and we were there to celebrate it. My friend asked if there was a happy hour before we turned up as she was seated earlier. She was told by a rude waitress by the name of Evelyn that there was one involving the purchase of sausages. I thought I had read a free flow promo from 6-8 Pm and asked Evelyn when I got seated. She sarcastically turned to my friend and made a snappy snide remark of “as I already told you just now it’s just this deal”. She rolled her eyes and I was in disbelief. She was constantly snappy and disinterested in service. She was poor in attitude and four faced. It was hard to get her attention for service so we started waving down other waitresses.

Our experience here was very marred by her terrible attitude. I hope there are enough bad reviews of her attitude for management to take notice. Otherwise Brotzeit is a lovely place."
Food always delicious and portions generous!!,"Loved the White Asparagus promotion but was too late, however enjoyed the meal there as usual. Requested for our favourite table during booking and was pleased they reserved it for us."
Still a good place to eat,"I have been there a few times and always enjoyed, being from Munich, German beer and food and there was no difference when I came back this May. Munich tradition on a Sunday late morning is having ""Weisswuerste, Brezel, and Weissbier"". It was Sunday (on the way to Sentosa) and 10.30 am so guess. Yes, I followed German tradition, got all that I ""needed"" and when I closed my eyes I was in Munich. Well, for a few seconds only. Lol."
value for money,"Indoor seating arrangements is awful and crampy. Flooring is terribly sticky and oily, really makes you question their standards. Food is good for value. And service is ok"
Great food & drinks for our lovely afternoon,"We visited on a Saturday evening at 5pm, was pretty crowded but we got an outdoor non-smoking seat. Ordered a sausage platter (meant for 2 pax) and 4 drinks. Sausage platter was good to share for 5 of us as a light snack before dinner. Good place to chill & hang out. (Do note, cigarette smell from smoking table might reach the non-smoking table if the wind is strong) Overall, we had a lovely afternoon with our drinks & good food."
Brotzeit German Bier Bar & Restaurant - Vivocity,"Brotzeit German Bier Bar & Restaurant - Vivocity. Had dinner with friends on a weekday & it was quite crowded. Recommended to make reservations before dining here. A good range of selection to choose from & quality of food is very good, especially with the cold Beer."
Night out with a friend at Vivo City,"Meal was terrific, beer can be colder. Portion n price was acceptable and the staff were pleasant. Lovely atmosphere. Will request for outdoor seats next time."
Great German restaurant in Singapore!,"A popular restaurant , we enjoyed a lovely lunch here. Meal portions are very gernerous, The menu is extensive and a good range of beers are available.
Customer service is good and from the time of placing your order until your meal arrives is not long.
Quality of produce is excellent.
An enjoyable meal in a very relaxing environment."
Nice Ambient for Couples,We had a happy Valentines Day in this restaurant. Nice food and beer with beautiful night outdoor view. The food and beer was served quite fast.
"Nice deck area, looking over to Sentosa","This German themed bar & restaurant sits on the waters edge side of VivoCity, offering a European menu and predominately German beers (no Tiger beer).

Service is brisk and everyone seems to be offered a special deal &/or an up-sell, which can be a little annoying.

We visited just for a refreshing icy cold beer after a morning wandering the large mall, and it was pleasant to sit out on the large deck, looking out to Sentosa and the busy ferry terminal.

It’s location, for me, is it’s biggest attraction."
Sausages are still as good,"Ordered the Brotzeit platter which includes different types of sausages, pork knuckle and ribs, and we had Rostock and truffle fries for our side dish choice.The sausages are still as good (except the boiled ones are too bland) and my family enjoyed a lot. The pork knuckle and ribs are a tad too dry for my liking. The rosti is superb and my daughters love the truffle fries too. We added 2 servings of each eventually. All in all a good dinner."
wonderful food,A great surprise in Asia to find a German restaurant and especially one that the food is delicious. The three of us all loved the food and the service was great
Excellent food with a view of Sentosa,Wonderful German restaurant... excellent happy hour beer offer between Mon to Fri. Wide variety of food choices for vegetarian and others ! you have outdoor view on ocean front as well as indoor and aircon. Just take note - the place is mostly crowded - You need to wave at the crew.
Good food,"Had lunch with my friends quite recently. Quite enjoyed the experience. Good selection of dishes. Huge portions. Very tasty. Decent variety of wines, beers, and other drinks. Waiters are friendly, the place is always busy"
Festive service,"Well, its festive and the Q outside is long. Dun expect any great service as long as orders are correct."
Great German Food,"If you love German food and beer then this is it . Variety of sausage platters available , for sharing . Good beer selection too"
Awesome Job done by Mihailo. Good job bro..!,Very accommodating even though its very busy Genuine Sevice. He knows very well how to handle the staff. Always with a great smile. Able to attend us everytime with a nice fluency of English. Thanks a lot man. I will come back again and again.keep it up. And enjoyed the platter as well compared to others. 5starsssssss
Nice Event in Singapore,"I have been trying to find more western locations in Singapore. I was a good place, food was decent and service fine. I thought the pricing was a bit higher than I expected though."
