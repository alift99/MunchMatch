Good lunch buffet,"First visit, here they served my favorite dish, cooked salmon, not bad, the soup next to the salmon dish was good too.
The poached crayfish and prawn on ice were okay, although I prefer the warm version, but the crab claw was nice.
The beef and short rib were above average. The scallop was good.
Some of the desserts were good too, except the chocolate cake too sweet, to avoid next time, but I liked the cheese cake.
Missed the steamed barramundi and the laksa, to note next time.
Tried 4 different types of bread, just so-so.
The sashimi section didn't look interesting, didn't bother to try.
Service was above average, used plate cleared promptly and ambience okay.
After discount paid SGD66 a good deal.
If they keep the salmon dish, I shall return."
Excellent Service,the staff is very attentive. and they also recommend cocktail if you don't know how to choose:) very nice!
Exceptional Lunch,Great ambiance and good food. Staff Bala is very accomodating and fast. I will recommend this place to my friends.
Fantastic Customer Service,"Great music, great atmosphere. Had an even greater experience being served by Jasmine. Her engaging customer service and helpful spirit is commendable and will definitely spur me on to make a trip here again!"
Great outdoor patio in a prime location,Large covered outdoor patio in a prime location on the corner of Scott and Orchard. Service was efficient and food pretty good too. I was here a Sunday evening and then it was pretty relaxed but I can imagine it gets much busier other times.
Breakfast,Stayed at Marriotts Tangs and this is the breakfast restaurant. A typical 5 star hotel spread with western and local options. Feels crowded as itâ€™s a weekend and hotel is large. Ok service
Great location,"A great location for any meal. We went for a late breakfast/early lunch and sat outside and just ""watched the world go by"". Great for a relaxing meal, though a little pricey."
People watching,"Given it's location at the corner of Orchard Road, lots of people walking past this spot. Unfortunately, currently only outdoor seating (due to Covid) so can be a bit warm during a hot humid day. Happy hour Mon-Thu so some consolation there."
Perfect Weekend Brunch,"Opening strictly at 11am, my brunch companions and I were there 15 minutes earlier, being a weekend. Outdoor tables were the only ones available, so one could eat and watch the world go by at the same time.

Our meal started off with the Assorted Satay followed by the familiar Hainanese Chicken Rice for me. The meat on the skewers were chunky and juicy, but I did wish the compressed rice was larger. Overall, the food was tasty and well cooked, and with the Apple Juice to wash it down, it was a perfect combination of a wonderful weekend and excellent company."
Adios Crossroads Cafe,"I canâ€™t say enough about Crossroads Cafe. Itâ€™s a perfect package wrap in one. Good location, lovely friendly staff, good variety of food, a place for families, friends, dates, solo and visitors to be dinning at! Unfortunately itâ€™ll be the last month for us all as Crossroads Cafe will be closing permanently come 1st December to make way for retail. So with a heavy heart, Iâ€™ll be toasting out another iconic place in Singapore. So if you are here in Singapore, do make your way there for your last farewells."
Amazing Service and great promotions,"Ladies night promotion was amazing and totally worth the price! Service rendered was phenomenal. 1st time here and definitely will be back. Came by for only drinks & desserts and their service was efficient and attentive. Special mention to Nathan, Venki, Krishnan & Shida. Will definitely be back."
Great Service & Food,"The staff and managers are very friendly and helpful. They have made my friends and I feel so welcome and special.
In particular the manager, Mr. Nathan, the waiter and waitress, namely Venky, Krishnan, Sheeda and Praveen. A huge thank you to all of you for always making us feel so welcome.
I would also like to mention that the lobster (part of the sea food specials ) is really delicious!!
Thank you."
Great ambience,"We love the ambience, great variety of food too. Tried the fish and chips and delighted with the overall standards. Must try! Great service and will visit again!"
Great service!!,"Was attended to by Mr Bala Krishna, great service! Ordered a steak for me and the famous Marriott burger for my wife. Food was excellent! Great job Crossroads cafe!!"
Afternoon chill,Nice and warm service by Bala and Shida! Great food and nice wines. Feel like having holiday somewhereâ€¦ Enjoy to max.
Fire the Chef (or at least advise/coach him/her),"Fish and chips - total disappointment. Limp, soft, tasteless. No seasoning. The codfish must have been so ashamed.

Nasi goreng - served cold and again, no seasoning and no spice. I will never pay $30 for this plate of crap ever.

Upside - staff is decent. Not the friendliest but they are okay and they do their job. Also, good atmosphere. Except if u sit near the sidewalk, youâ€™ll be a second-hand smoker cuz you can smell all those cigarettes from the smokersâ€™ corner."
Excellent Service + Fantastic Food + Amazing Ambience,"My husband & I favour great ambience & service, great food is a bonus! Crossraods has the triple treat of fantastic dining environment, a variety of delicious cuisine, and super cool & helpful staff, with special mention - Jerom, who leads & works well together with his staff, to ensure the customers enjoy a good dining experience at Crossroads. Thanks to all of you! Looking forward to the next visit!"
Unpretentious Fare on Orchard Road,Crossroads is ideal for entertaining friends with minimum fuss in the perfect spot in town. Nice selection of local favorites as well as international dishes. Bala my server helped to handle all my requests quickly and efficiently and was always attentive.

Thank you Bala,Thank you Bala for the lovely service. The beef signature horfun is fantastic yummy with red. I love the alfresco atmosphere
What on earth is this burnt thing,I await everyoneâ€™s comments this is what a 28 dollar something looks like at the cross roads sent back three times
"Lovely view, drinks, food and staff.","Covid 19 has closed down many good establishments, but I am glad that Crossroads is still here to stay.

Attentive and prompt service from Manager Jerom, Staff Ajay, Zaki, Jeff and Praveen.

The kitchen has done a beautiful job with my Beef Horfun (forgotten to take a picture) and dessert."
HORRIFIC,"Ridiculous, I have been a regular of this establishment for 10+ years. The service is always great, the food is becoming deplorable. Firstly the menu hasnâ€™t changed on 10 years.
Secondly the chef just doesnâ€™t care on what gets served, the fish and chips is like mush, the burgers have more grizzle than meat, the pasta has more chilli than noodles, the curry chicken is tasteless, the hor-fun is corn starch, the chicken rice is salty and I can go on and on but will stop here!!!

PLEASE FIX IT!!!!"
Crossroads Cafe - a Singapore icon spoilt by temple pounding muzak,"I have always loved people watching at Crossroads. The cafe has been there on the corner of Tangs Plaza forever, the waiters are invariably cordial, the menu varied and reasonably priced. Such a shame then that the choice of background music yesterday was so awful, that kind of eardrum pounding bass sound which drives you nuts after a while. I hope my feedback to the restaurant manager does not fall on deaf ears ;) .Perhaps they could take a leaf from the PS Cafe playbook and their new restaurant at Raffles City where the incidental music is stylish, appropriate and as it should be, in the background."
Great food by chef Ravi,"Great food by chef Ravi who deliver or request and by staff member that take care of us..Sha, Jeff, praveen, venky, Krishna and Bala, thanks for the manager service, Nathan, will recommend to other and will be back,"

Great food, beautiful, extra special and warm service from Bala (despite us changing orders after spotting the fabulous â€˜tender juicy meat creationsâ€™ chalkboard specials)!!! Nice music and just perfect saturday evening street spirit on this corner of scotts and orchard!"
"Nice mini-break, good food","Good food and good drinks at decent prices for a five-star hotel in the middle of Orchard. One of the few places where you can simply sit and people watch.

The sate was the best Iâ€™ve had since that distant memory of flying Singapore airlines...

It gets busy at times, and they have the same staff issue as everywhere in Singapore right now, but staff is friendly when they get time for it."

"Average, burger not great","Tried the Asparagus salad with chicken and Wagyu Burger.

Salad was nice, chicken well seasoned. Wagyu Burger was unfortunately a real let down, lacking much flavour. As far as burgers go, this is quite poor compared to other options in Singapore."
Amazing place to hangout,"The food and drinks was amazing!!service was great especially manager Nathan, Jeff and bala and bartender praveen who took care of us. Thank you will visit again...."

You should cross the crossroads to have a bite at Crossroads,"Nice oasis in orchard road area, much more open than PrivÃ© opposite from the crossroads. Long menu and drinks list for a CafÃ©. The char kway teow is less good than the one at One Ninety at Four Seasons Hotel, but itâ€™s pretty good. Friendly service staff. If you have Entertainer 1-for-1 deal, itâ€™s excellent value."
Awesome Honeymoon!,We just got married and decided to have a short staycation in Marriott Hotel. Came down to Crossroads for their Tuesday lobster. SO GOOD! Service crew found out about our little celebration (shout out to Venky!) and organized a dessert for us. Lovely touch! Great service! Made our evening very special. Thank you!

Excellent service,Excellent service by Krishnan and Bala. These guys are excellent. After being stuck in Singapore for 3 months these guys took care of me. They are always thoughtful and pleasant. Made my stay here a ton better.
Good and Bad Experience,"The Crossroads Cafe is one of the most high profile cafes in Singapore due to its incredibly busy passing trade location at Tangs Plaza.

The location, decor and ambiance are excellent. The menu is sufficiently varied to suit most people and the drinks menu similarly extensive.

The bar is quite expensive compared to most, which is solely due to location, location, location.

Our visit today as a couple seeking some refreshment after a day's shopping was a mixed experience.

Unfortunately, my girlfriend and I were greeted by a very rude waiter (Jeff) who was more intent on lecturing us about the social distancing laws rather than seeking to make us comfortably seated and well served.

Happily for us, we managed to receive more attention from the Manager, Nathan who unlike Jeff was very polite, professional and cautious. From then onwards, service from Bala was similarly professional, attentive and polite.

So, on the whole, I would recommend the Crossroads Cafe for visit for locals and tourists alike. We ordered club sandwiches for both of us and we were incredibly impressed with the standard of the food.

Beers and Gin & Tonics were also served professionally and with due care.

Thank you to Nathan and Bala for a memorable visit. Perhaps you can advise Jeff on how it should be done in future."
Dinner and drinks,Bala was very attentive to us and answered our queries in a friendly way. Good vibes and service :) will be back again
Visit to Crossroads Cafe,Waiter bala was good with customer service. He was quick to serve us and had a sense of humour too. Good job!
Visit to Crossroads cafe,"My visit was great due to Bala's excellent service. He was attentive, humorous and polite. Thank you Bala!"
"Great atmosphere, food and servce",Had lunch with family last Sat. The wayu steak and local food were great. Were served by Ajay and he was helpful trying to find us a good table and etc. Would love to go back soon!
Shyane & Elton impressed us @ staycation,"Locked in Singapore and spiced with a staycation, we are pleased to experience the hotel stay. Shyane and Elton are the reasons we are confident of the local hospitality industry and in the right hands of the younger generation. Keep up both and best wishes!"
Thanksgiving dinner,Great dinner again ; very well looked after by top staff /Krishna as usual The turkey was moist and not overcooked. Very attentive service
Great food!,"The aglio olio pasta portion was big and delicious! Cocktail and whiskey was perfect too, highly recommended for gatherings!"
