Wedding anniversary,"The last time I visited this restaurant was in 2018. Didn’t like the ambience as the music was too loud, food were so so. Decided to give it another try. Food tasted so much better and staffs were friendly too. Music was light and soft. Also like that they served proper fresh prawns and not those frozen ones. For me, seafood pasta will be the reason for me to decide whether the restaurant is worth another visit again. Will definitely dine here again."
Delicious,"Amazing service, attentive staff and exceedingly good food. One of my favourite restaurants in such a unique location. Definitely recommend"
What a nice restaueant with a lousy manager!,The manager rant his anger of his own operation issues to a frequent customer.. don't go there again!
Great place,"Food, wine selection, service are all good. Crowded on a Friday night, we were glad we made reservations."
Dinner with friends,One of my favourite restaurant. Love to bring to my friends there for meals Service and food are good and fresh.
Authentic Italian cuisine in Singapore,"Excellent and authentic Italian food, nice atmosphere and friendly team! Highly highly recommended !"
It was not the Chef’s day,Regular diner but somehow the food was below par. Service was directed more towards food delivery and attention was lacking
Delighted meal,Service was exemplary and staff shies interests in our dinning experience and was forthcoming when we told them that we are celebrating a birthday
"Great Food, Great Service!","Was craving Italian food and was not in favour of travelling to the city center. This restaurant located in a quiet estate, served us delicious food with a side of pleasant service. We will definitely visit again!"
good food and service,"Although there was no background music, but the ambience was still great. The food was yummy, service was good too."
Great pizza!,Great pizzas made from scratch using traditional stone ovens in the Restaurant! Fresh ingredients with crispy crust! Certainly a pizza to die for?
Strictly 6pm,"We made a dinner booking at 6pm. Called them at 4+pm as we know we'll reach there at 545pm and ask if we can have some drinks before we start our dinner. They said no. Can only open at 6pm. We try to delay as much as we can and still end up reaching their door at 5:52. There're 2 waitress inside all tables already set up and 1 waiter was outside. He saw us and simply brush us off to wait till they're open at 6pm (which is 8min, later). I am keen to know if that's what the owner of Baci Baci will do and tell their staff they strictly can open at 6pm even though they're ready for customers to just have a drink?

We had a bottle of their nice white Etna Bianco, start with Burrata and had whole fish Branzino to share. Starter bread was cold and total cost SGD 215. For such service, type of food and price. It won't be our regular night out for a quick meal."
Lovely neighbourhood Italian,Lovely neighbourhood Italian restaurant. Bright and inviting interior. The food was excellent and the service friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back
Good food in a quiet residential location!,"First time back in this restaurant after many years. Am glad they are still in operations. The service is top notch. The food is excellent : garlic bread, angel hair pasta, risotto, etc. Will be back again!"
Date Night,"Found this place via TripAdvisor, read the reviews and thought why not, made a booking with Amos. From start to finish, I had a great date and it was thanks to Baci Baci. Food was really good started with the calamari, had the rib eye, perfect and ended with the lava cake, was eyeing the tiramisu. What made it most enjoyable were the staff, attentive service and friendly. Amosnis a rrally food host, really pleasant and welcoming, i forgot my mask and he got me a new one, dropped my mask during dinner and the manager replaced it with a new one. Ordered a bottle, Amos allowed me to wait till my guest arrived before making a decision, the wine was good, think a vemmenti we ordered.The manager knew we wanted to share our main course and got it shared on two separate plates, without us asking for it.. excellent. The whole experience was nice, the food, the wine and the people. Definitely will be back again and this time the lamb and tiramisu will be my main desire. Definitely a great place for family, friends, business meetings and dates.. really impressed, service like this should not go unrecognized."
Authentic Italian restaurant in the neighbourhood,Authentic Italian restaurant hidden in a residential estate that serves really great Italian food and desserts
Best pizza in singapore,I often tried pizza in singapore finally i found a good one thanks we will come again. Very nice service even the headchef is nice.
Baci Baci Very Good,"Friendly staff, great food. and nice setting. Would definitely go again. Also a nice place to go with children."
Birthday celebration,"We went there for my birthday celebration, decent price around the neighborhood. The food is good too"
Peaceful Dinner in Serangoon,Great homely vibes and fun waitstaff. Loved the prosciutto and burrata. Lobster pasta was a disappointment.
Excellent choice for friends gathering,"We very much enjoyed our first gathering dinner of 2020 together here. Delicious pizza and lagsana, yummy dessert with a good list of wine.
Mr. Kevin, the manager, welcomed us with great hospitality and good recommendations on the food.
Overall, a really great dinner as a great start of the new year."
Neighbourhood Restaurant That Serves Affordable Authentic Italian Cuisine,"Tucked away in a quiet corner of an upmarket residential area, is this neighbourhood restaurant that serves affordable and authentic Italian cuisine.
The 2 head chefs are Italians, which I feel accounted for the quality of the food. The pizzas are baked, on order, and in an open fire oven.
Service is decent too, now under a new management. Will certainly be back again soon!"
Excellent food and great service.,We had such a delicious dinner and the portions were big. Enjoyed every bite. Will definitely be back for more.
Excellent service and food,Came here for my birthday with my family. We shared a 1kg Angus steak which was the most excellent piece of meat we ever had . The chef allowed us to take funny mugshots of him serving pizza. The food fire pizza was fantastic. Overall 2 thumbs up.
"Disappointing, terrible service","- Staff who looked like he was the manager/owner was rude when we asked if the entertainer app can be used - ""it is stated on the app""
- He took away our bread bowl even before we finished eating without asking us
- When we asked for additional bread, he said yes but DID NOT return with bread throughout the rest of the 45min dinner
- When he was trying to get to another table, he pushed our chairs to get through the narrow path
- Food was otherwise ok, chefs seem friendly but was very put off by this service"
"Cosy, Authentic Italian Restaurant","One of the best places to eat Italian in the northeast part of Singapore. Tucked away in one of the lanes off Serangoon Gardens, this place is a really cosy gem with a nice stone oven for pizzas. I like how the patrons who walked in seemed very familiar with the wait staff, showing that this small place has a loyal following.

We ordered a few dishes because of the Entertainer promotion that's available here - the Angel Hair Crab Meat pasta, Porcini Ravioli, White Wine Clams Vongole, Buffalo Mozarella Cheese Salad and Parma Ham Pizza. Out of all we ordered, the Vongole was utterly disappointing, but everything else was superb. So it might have been an off day for the kitchen just for this dish, although that said it felt like the clams weren't fresh which made the Vongole fall flat. However, given the quality of the other dishes, I'm willing to discount this as a random error and still give the place a five star rating."
Delightful gem in a delightful neighborhood,"This is not the area i come often or familiar with. An appointment ended in the vicinity at 1:00pm and i was famished. i whipped up an app to search for a nearby restaurant and Baci Baci came up with good ratings. So my friend and I google mapped and ended up here on a rainy afternoon.

A wood-fired oven greeted us on entry. Awesome aroma! Unfortunately, we are not pizza people and we wanted to cut out the carbs (so pasta is ruled out). So we settled for their weekly special of oven-baked sea-bass (for 2) and a dessert platter (for 2). It was soooo good.

The service and the food are both excellent. It was worth the visit."
Nice pizza in Singapore,"As Italian living in Singapore, I realised it's a bit difficult to find the right restaurant to feel home.. Baci Baci brings your back to Italy without taking a 12h direct flight from Changi! The pizzaiolo is super nice and can make an amazing pizza! It's really worth going there even if a bit far from downtown.. I recommend the 1 for 1 pizza in Tuesday"
yummy risotto but disappointing lobster ravioli,"place to consider for a quiet lunch. we ordered a pizza, melon with prosciutto, burratina with prosciutto (yums), mushroom risotto (yums x10), lobster ravioli (no). the reviews with images of lobster ravioli made us really excited about it and i was really hoping for it to be good. unfortunately it was way too salty and the lobster meat had shrunk to the size of a... big prawn at most. ravioli was also dry and tough. bread was also served late into the meal, but at least it was warm. luckily the risotto and burratina were winners."
Brilliant dinner,"Honestly 10 years in Singapore. Best pizza here, best linguine vongole and brilliant wine! Great service. Thank you!"
Incredible Italian,"My husband and I visited Back Baci for our anniversary dinner and had a really wonderful evening.

I had the porcini ravioli, while my husband had the Baci Baci calzoni. We finished with a creme brûlée and a mint panna cotta (which was kindly given to us on the house to mark our special occasion) All the food was absolute perfection and the portion sizes were more than generous. Other people have commented that the food is a bit pricey but given the quality of the food and how much time and effort has gone into preparing it, it was worth every penny!

The service was great and the staff were very attentive. I will be recommending to my friends!"
Dissapointing,"Went on valentines day. Was surprised to see a valentines day set menu on the table as there was no mention of it during booking. Apart from the soup which was nice and flavourful, everything else was terrible. The 'tenderloin' as they described it was stuffed with vegetables and we were not even asked for our preferred doneness. The quality of the beef was bad. The cake desert was also overly sweet and tasted off. There was no service whatsoever. Will not come back."
Horrific Dinner,"Went on Valentine's, absolute horror to have had dinner here.

The menu was prepped and looked terrible. The food was such a disappointment; pasta and sauce wasn't fresh. The beef was not done properly and tasted like rubber.bthe fish that was prepared tasted like burnt meat from a BBQ. Disheartening to have known that such standards actually could have passed for the dinner."
Dinner at Baci Baci,"This was actually our very 1st visit after their official opening years ago. The first time we went, we felt some how uncomfortable as we were waiting outside the restaurant but no one seems to see us! We decided to give them another chance after so many years of not visiting because of the first encounter which left us disappointed. This time, we called 15 minutes in advance to check if there are availability. When we were there, we were shown to our table. Menu came fast but was laid upside down. To me, this shows how serious are the staffs in their job. No introduction on any special items available till we asked. Food cane not long after we ordered but one of the dish was wrongly made. We just ate! Presentation was great on the plate. I love the appetizer, Burata as it comes with lots of different vegetable. I look for the taste of Tiramisu at Italian restaurant to see if I’ll return again. It did not disappoint me. The thing that disappoint me was the music, playing Electronic music which I found it too loud and noisy, one of the staff assumed that we might not be drinking wine, came by and took the wine glasses and said,” Not drinking wine right?”! I think a better way to put it should be, “May I asked if you will be having wine tonight?” instead. Take note that the price is slightly on the high side."
Baci Baci,The one-for-one pizza offer is really worth it and the pizza is well done! The service is also awesome Will definitely come back again.
Nice ambience for a quiet dinner,"We arrived early even before the restaurant opening hours for dinner. But the server was nice enough to let us in and show us a table. He even started to serve us some water while busy getting the place ready. That was a nice touch of service.
The food was really delicious. Though the pricing is not particularly moderate, the serving size was rather generous. We had the Hokkaido scallops with Parma ham in cream sauce. It was nice portion for two pax. We next ordered the beef steak which came cooked to our requested doneness. The grilled vegetables side were a nice touch. We paired with a super Tuscan wine which was very very good for s$180. I expected to pay more. We even made room for dessert which was a chocolate lava cake.
All in all it was a great experience.
Why not 5 Star? One other female server probably had a bad day; she was sulking during service. So, that caused the one star short."
"Nice Ambience, Good Food, Slightly Pricey","Came here with my wife. Did an app booking and got a 10% discount. My conclusion are:

Ambience: nice quiet place tucked in a corner of Serangoon garden. Good quiet place for a chat or catch up! Parking may be limited but there isn’t many people to compete for car park lots here.

Food: Food quality is above average. Look authentic to me though I am no Italian Food expert. My wife and I enjoy the dinner. Quantity is just nice.

Price: the price is slightly pricey (to me)."
Inconsistent food and bad experience,"We had really great food at the restaurant (burrata, sausage pasta, lamb, wine) when we first visited in feb 2018. However, our recent experience was really bad. The anti-pasti that we ordered was still good and while we were eating it, we were still remarking how nice the food was. But, you know something is wrong when you smell food burning up in the firewood oven, and then you are served a pizza with a rather burnt crust. The waiter told us that he can send it back if we want, as we just stared at the pizza when it was served. I think this really offended the chef but he did send back a second pizza with no burnt sides but one that had a really soggy base. The waiter promptly told us that this is the best they can do. We had one bite of the pizza and asked for the bill and left without having our dinner. The inconsistency across the two experiences is a real shame esp when we thought we had found a good Italian restaurant that is not overcrowded..now we know why it is not."
Food and service were great.,"Food was great, not too salty or oily, fantastic! Service was great as well, staff were friendly and attentive. Good ambience. I love the visit."
You get what you pay for,"Had Sunday lunch with family. Pizzas were good, not amazing. Unique way of cooking carbonara which isn’t to my liking but Risotto was excellent!"
excellent!,"excellent food, good service, great ambience - situated in a nice and quiet neighbourhood. perfect for dates."
Nice chill place,"Arrived early ard 6pm on a weekday, there was no crowd yet. Enjoyed their ham & mushroom pizza, however find that the carbonara had an overwhelming porky taste. Don't mind visiting again."
"Great setting, home cooked food and generous portions","We've been a few times now and the food has never disappointed. The serving portions are large and they don't stinge on the ingredients. The food is really well prepared, presented very well and taste great!"
Lunch for end of year “thank you for AIS volunteers”,"Buffet style with pizza, salad, calamari & Prawns, roasted vegetables, chicken fillets, roasted potatoes & dessert were delicious. Staff were friendly, attentive & professional. Nice place for family & functions."
Good but slightly overpriced,"Tucked away in a quiet corner somewhere in Serangoon Gardens, they are the only restaurant in the row of shophouses there.

We decided to try after reading some good reviews. The ambience was nice, not too crowded on a Friday night. Food was good. We had 1 soup, 2 antipasti, 2 mains, 1 dessert, some wine and the bill came up to more than $300. I thought it was a little steep for a neighborhood joint."
Good Italian food in Singapore,"Usually I do not like Italian restaurant and food far from Italy (I am Italian) but I really appreciated this restaurant both for food than for staff that is really professional. I enjoyed a mixed starter with parmigiana mozzarella, burrata and fried prawns and squid . Then delicious pasta with crab and martini , with a good negroamaro wine . I really enjoyed both dinner than location . Really good."
baci baci,nice good and considerable cheap compare to other same type restaurant. recommandef and will go back again.
Enjoyed nice Italian food and wine,"I came here with a great friend to have a nice quiet dinner in Serangoon to catch up on things. Luckily we found good reviews TripAdvisor for Baci Baci. We really enjoyed the food especially the antipasti salad/cold cuts platter and main courses of veal spaghetti and lobster ravioli. The red wine was also nice and overall service of staff was good.
I would highly recommend Baci Baci and will definitely be back again."
"Excellent, as ever","Date night at Baci Baci. Food was as wonderful as ever (my personal favourite is the ossi bucco), service first class, nice wines, reasonable price. We missed Abdullah (night off) but the rest of the team did a great job. Love this restaurant."
Slightly disappointed...,"With this place just round the corner from our place, we finally decided to give it a try after seeing all the thumbs up from other patrons. Widely regarded as one of Singapore's best Italian restaurant, we had set our hopes really high and were expecting to be impressed. Sad to say, for us, it was quite a let down. Our party of 5 arrived on a lazy Saturday afternoon and there were sparsely any other patrons, which was great for us as we wanted some privacy for our get-together. Nicely decorated and designed, it gave an overall cosy and nice place to chill out. However, it was a tiny restaurant, which would have been uncomfortable if the place was packed.Service was excellent and could not be faulted. The food was where the real let-down was. I had carbonara, and the rest had items such as prawn oglio and risotto. As I'm a carbonara fan, I've been trying out carbonara at multiple places, and I must say, for an authentic Italian restaurant, their standard of an Italian food was sub-par. The cream was not to my liking. The same went for the rest of the dishes, where we had tasted far better elsewhere. In the end, the appetiser bread with olive oil & vinegar was probably the besst dish served! Overall, I would recommend this place for friends to chill out and have drinks, the food....not so much."
"Fantastic, Higly Recommended.","We loved the food, service and the ambience, They were very packed and handful of staff, But instead they did tremendous job, Food was delicious and can say it was really authentic, Service was great, all i can say that i will recommend this restaurant to all my buddies. Situated somewhere near serangoon, hard to find ,but its a hidden gem. Overall a great satisfaction."
overrated underwhelming,"Having been recommended to this restaurant, I must admit I was very disappointed. In over 40 years of dining at Italian restaurants, I encountered my worst ever pizza. The base of the Margherita pizza was a solid tough dough and there was no basil on the topping. It was almost inedible and no staff member queried the fact that most was left on the plate.
We found the wait staff surly and unsmiling.
However the host was welcoming and pleasant; and those who ordered pasta dishes were satisfied with their meals."
Amazing Ambiance but poor service and food,Ambiance amidst the quiet Serangoon landed house area is amazing. However the staff service was not that great - it would be much nicer if there were staff who would greet and talk to you politely.
Incredible pizza with great service,A bit of a hike to Baci Baci but well worth the effort.. a great environment and fabulous pizzas... a busy place and highly recommended
Good food but not so cheap,The pizza was pretty good. The 4 cheese was better than Hawaiian. Found the tomato sauce is the Hawaiian a little tart. Otherwise it's tasty.
A Birthday treat for girl...,"This is my 3rd time at Baci Baci . Fantasy dinner ! Friendly staff . we loved the place, very welcoming and warm , the Boss and staff were very experienced on recommending the menu and very friendly. We had a Hawaiian wood fired pizza, Risotto and Cod fish . The portion was very generous. A recommended white wine to pair with ... thumbs up! . We had a lovely dinner complete with their signature Tiramisu and chocolate lava cake deco with strawberries and blueberries as birthday cake for my girl. Can't wait to go back again ... higly recommended this little gem hiding in the estate! A little pricey and but definitely worth the money..."
A brilliant combination of traditional Italian with fresh ingredients,"I have been to Baci Baci a few times and they never disappoint. Be it the antipasti, pasta, meat or seafood platter or the wine selection, the choices are always good and the ingredients, fresh. Service is also thoughtful without being overbearing. A gem in the neighbourhood and for the quality and prices, definitely worth a schlep from further away."
Italian Fine Dining in cosy residential neighborhood!,"High quality Italian fine dining option at Serangoon Gardens residential neighborhood! Ingredients used are extremely fresh and the waitress can even suggest dishes not found on the menu and the chef is able to customize to your taste. However on the day we visited for lunch, pizza is not available for some reason. Tried the pasta dishes and find them to be really good, including the crab angel hair pasta! Service was prompt and attentive. Nested in a quiet residential area, parking can be found along the roads around the restaurant."
Trained Italian Chef,"Excellent Italian food, well prepared. I had the Cod which was cooked to perfection.

Baci Baci serves a nice french bread with meal, very rare in Singapore, they usually serve a slice of stale plain bread if any. So, for me this a treat.

The Pizza is very good and I have had the Pasta as well."
LJP gathering,"Good food and excellent service. Group of 19 of us had lunch at this place on a Saturday. Ordered most of the best items like pizzas, pasta, steak and fish. Brought our own champagnes and wines which complemented the food well. Would visit again."
Genuine Italian Food,"Excellent food and friendly/effective service, great atmosphere, wonderful home-made bread. Well worth a visit."
One of the best Italian joints in Singapore,"Being located in a local Neighbourhood, Baci Baci is not as well known as the Italian restaurants in downtown Singapore. But food quality, pricing, service and ambience all considered together, I would rate it as one of Singapore's best Italian joints. Last night, we had the Wagyu beef and the sea bass for our main courses and both did not disappoint."
Superb evening!,"Discovered Baci Baci through friends, delighted to have shared a meal with them at this restaurant.
Nicely designed interior, fine wine cellar on display, excellent ambience.
Food was excellent, everything we ordered was delicious and nicely presented. Advice on the wine list was first rate (thankyou Abdullah). Service was great. Salvatore came out to say hello.
Just a wonderful meal and evening.

One suggestion, time the meal delivery better. One of the started came a little late and two of the mains came quite a bit later than the other two. However, the rest of the experience was so good this does not affect my 5 star review."
Regular,"we've been eating at Baci Baci for two years, and even if/when we move well keep coming back. Great food, service and value. Dormer family"
Little Italy in suburban Serangoon,"I would never have found this restaurant if it hadn't popped up on Tripadvisor. Looking for an italian meal, and preferably avoiding the crowds in the heart of the city. Well, Baci Baci is tucked away in a quiet street in Serangoon, just off Yio Chu Kang road. Plenty of street parking for those who drive, and a short stroll from Serangoon Garden Way, for the ecologically inclined diners who use public transport. Baci Baci is located at the corner of a row of unprepossessing shop houses, with a frontage of green shrubs. What a surprise when you walk in - a large, modern dining area with a grass-fronted kitchen area at the rear, and a walk-in wine cellar just to the right of the entrance. We arrived early, and it was quiet, but started getting busy around 700-730. The menu has a suitably wide selection of starters and mains. Portions were large. Three of us shared the caprese di bufala salad, and we were pretty satisfied. Bread was served with the starter, and it was generous and warm! For mains, the osso buco was tomato based served on saffron risotto. The saltimbocca was generous, if a touch chewy. We also enjoyed the fruit based sorbets to end. Service was friendly and efficient. Prices are more in line with city-based restaurants than your neighbourhood diner, but probably in line with the ambience and food on offer. You can turn up in shorts, but you'll probably fit the decor better if you are smartly dressed :-)."
Birthdays dinner,"We were invited by our good friends to join the family for dinner to celebrate the birthdays of mother and daughter. This restaurant is located in the midst of a residential area. The interior of the restaurant is very tastefully done up. Despite it being a Sunday, the place was fully booked. The food was excellent and service was very good too. Compliments to the Operations Manager, Mr Raju who was very attentive despite the crowd. Will definitely visit again."
Great ambience and service,"Discovered this neighborhood restaurant, a gem. Lovely ambience, great staff. The starters were great - we had the calamari/seafood starter and a Caprese salad. The mains were not bad - the lobster pasta and lobster ravioli were pretty decent but no outstanding. The sirloin steak was a disaster (we regularly grill good steaks at home, so the different was stark). Then again, you wouldn't go to an Italian restaurant for a steak... Will try the pizza one day. Not quite sure we will be back."
Yum ... that is good Italian!,"A restaurant that exceeds expectations is such fun.
We have walked past it several times but tonight we gave it a try, and we were delighted! Great food great service and great wine list.

Being tucked away seems to add a little to the allure, I don't think you will be disappointed. We were delighted!"
Nice dinner treat,"We were invited for dinner with a close couple friends of ours and she didn't want to bother heading into the city area and chanced upon the above that's close to where they lived, so it's a first for us all. Surprisingly it was located amongst the shop houses of Serangoon Gardens, like a stand alone corner unit and with ample parking (especially in the evenings) along the roadside. The place was rather quaint and even has outdoor el fresco dinning if one prefers.
We had the soup and entree which was nice and ordered the wagyu beef platter for us 4 and the knowledgeable sommelier recommended a decent bottle of red (not too expensive I think). Staff was courteous and attentive too. However, I'm not sure how much was the final bill as it was a treat. Nice place."
Great ambience and good food but somewhat pricey,"As reviewed by many others, the food quality is as good as you can get in most fine dining Italian restaurants in town. The ambience is really cozy and atmospheric with Italian arias played. The wine list is extensive and the house wine is decent. This restaurant would do very well in a city location but being tucked in a suburb, it has a different feel to it especially when customers show up in Bermuda shorts. With prices equivalent to fine dining restaurants, it is not a restaurant I would go as often on weekends with the family. That's a shame as we enjoy the experience very much, each time when we visit."
Best Italian in Singapore,"Some good friends invited us to join them for dinner at Baci Baci. We rarely venture into the 'burbs, but this little gem was well worth the journey! The restaurant is a corner shophouse, with a relaxed and elegant interior. Baci Baci serves good honest authentic Italian dishes, which is so hard to find in Singapore. The restaurant clearly buys top quality ingredients, everything tasted beautifully fresh. My Osso Bucco was tasty and perfectly done, and my wife's risotto with porcini mushrooms and truffles was perfect with the Brunello di Montalcino. Portion sizes are generous. They even have a selection of fantastic Italian craft beers! Not the uninspiring Tiger/Peroni/Stella beer list you might find most places. The service was attentive and the staff all very friendly. I will definitely be going back! Even just for the beer would be worth it, but the whole experience was perfect and such a refreshing change from typical Italian fare in Singapore."
Just the best,This is the best authentic and friendly Italian in Singapore tucked away from the hustle and bustle but well worth an indulgent taxi ride and an evening of dedicated Italian cuisine and hospitality.
Great food in a great setting!,"Hidden away deep inside Lichfield Rd is this hidden gem of a restaurant. We used to patronise what was the now defunct Bourno, so when we saw that Baci Baci had renovated the place and taken over, we went to try it out.
And we were blown away by the quality of the food and the nice setting. It's become a family favourite for Sunday evening dinners as a family.
It has a beautiful setting with great decor, and spaciously set out with enough room for privacy for each table.
The staff are also super friendly, and at hand with a smile when we enter.

Food wise, it's top quality and great tasting. We love to start with their Calamari, which is perfectly fried and paired with a great dip. We also love to order their seafood soup, which is packed with fresh seafood and very tasty.
Mains: their pastas are all good; i particularly like their seafood pasta and their vongole. I also tried their lamb which was really really nicely done. They also recently started selling pizzas on their menu, with a pizza oven (wood fire). You get a great tasting pizza with the wood-y taste, and very generous toppings.

Great for a nice dinner with family or friends, or to take a date there.
You won't be disappointed!"
VERY GOOD AND FRIENDLY RESTAURANT,"Nice cozy and out of town restaurant.standard of food is excellent and services is friendly. The feel of always ""want to go back"""
A Hidden Gem!,"A charming restaurant in a quiet neighborhood and such fabulous Italian food. All was good from starter to dessert. I enjoyed the vongole clams, the squid ink risotto was tasty (altho a tad salty) and as for the tiramisu, although not my favorite dessert, it was superb."
Best Pizza in Singapore!,"Visiting this restaurant is like being invited into an Italian home, immaculate decor, warm, friendly staff and delicious food, excellent wines and relaxing Italian music for your ears - a positive assault on all of your senses!
The best tomato base on a pizza I have eaten in Singapore, great selection of Italian wines by the glass. Thank you Salvatore for making us so welcome that we visited again within the same week for dinner when I was allowed to order off menu a very tasty pasta arrabiata, again superb!"
A hidden Gem in Singapore,This is simply one of the best places in Singapore for authentic Italian food.The Ambiance and food especially the Pizza was exceptional and highly recommended. Its a little way out but well worth the taxi ride. Simply excellent.
"Pricey, but food is good and ambiance is good","Went with my SO over the weekend. Hard to get to if you're not driving, and you have to know what you're looking for.

Ambiance is perfect for a nice quiet dinner with your other half. The staff is polite and non-instrusive at all times. We took our time with the menu and the staff only approached us after it was clear we're done choosing (we closed the menu and placed it on the table)

Must-try: their claims are simply delicious."
Little Gem in the suburbs.,"Went to Baci Baci as many 'local' places were closed across the Chinese New Year holidays. Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food, service and ambiance.
It was not to busy, making the ambiance and service particularly luxurious. That said, not sure how the staff would handle a full house.
Some dishes we tried were good, others were reasonable.
Overall a very pleasant experience and highly recommended if you are looking for something different in the locale."
Excellent Italian food.,"Not located in the fanciest area of Singapore, this restaurant worth the trip to Serangoon. The real italian food cooked by the Chef`Paqui is amazing. Mabel is always welcoming people with a smile and service is very good which is not so usual in Singapore."
First romantic dinner with kelvin,"Our first romantic dinner. Amazing r.s. I love baci baci , the ambience is good, service also good, most importantly the food is awesome, thanks for my dear to bought me there. Kiki:)"
Perfect Ambience,Less choice for Vegetarians Courteous & excellent staff and service pleasant ambiance. Even allowed to cancel the one dish we had ordered
Great food with Great Service,"Everyone enjoyed the food, esp my daughters. The ingredients were very fresh. Special mention to the lobster ravioli which was just fantastic. If there was no one watching, i would have licked the plate dry, The ambience was good and Mabel was the perfect host. Would be back again."
A Kiss(baci) from us to you,"My babe and I were finding a perfect place to dine for New Year's Eve and we found Baci Baci! Such perfect ambience and service was excellent. Walked into the restaurant and was greeted by Mabel , she's is as lovely as the whole set up of the restaurant. We were introduced to the amazing chef and was very impressed by his skills! Italian cravings definitely satisfied ! We wish Baci Baci the best as the new year approaches , we love you and did I mention I love my man?"
An unexpected find,Excellent food! We had the antipasto platter for 4 which had a nice mix of Flavours. The beef with 3 pepper sauce was cooked to perfection and presented nicely. Great service and a good wine selection. No problems parking.
Definitely worth a try,"Good food, pleasant ambiance and great service. We over ordered and they graciously allowed us to cancel one dish. The lobster ravioli was excellent."
Lovely Christmas decor,"We had the seafood platter, beef special and squid ink risotto. The risotto was the best with fresh ingredients. Mabel is indeed enthusiastic and made us feel at home. I love the beautiful Christmas decor."
HIDDEN GEM IN SERANGOON GARDENS,"Was not sure if the food would match the prices, but having been there a few times now, I can vouch that the food is excellent and consistent in quality. You would expect such restaurants in downtown, but this is a hidden gem in a classy suburban neighbourhood, some 11km from the city centre. It is worth the drive just to see the real Singapore, passing through the famous HDB public housing estates which are more like private flats in other countries. Mabel is such an elegant and excellent host that once would think she is the owner. The pizzas are really good and fired in the special open oven. Unfortunately, on my latest visit, the pizza chef was not available. Nonetheless, the other items on the menu are fantastic. Try the sword fish if in season, the squid ink pasta, truffle risotto and more."
Hidden Gem in our backyard,"Great food, great service. The food is consistently good each time I return to the restaurant. They have such quality wine and food that complement each other so well and is worth every cent. Every trip to the restaurant is such a treat!"
Great Ambience,"A quiet and friendly family restaurant. Food is authentic Italian and fresh. Service is friendly, esp. Mabel - she's a cheerful and bubbly personality. Definitely worth a visit."

Hidden treasure,"Had dinner last week.great food,great service Raju.Thanks for the lemoncello.Definitely will come back with the family"
"Excellent Service, Good Quality Food and a Cozy Vibe","Wonderful little find thanks to a friend's recommendation, Baci Baci serves high quality Italian food with a smile and a dash of typical Italian bravado thrown in for good measure.

Staff (special mention goes to Mabel, who handled all our requests with ease) were extremely attentive and gushed endlessly about the food and were eager to provide recommendations. Their bread basket had some of the most exquisite bread I'd ever tasted in Singapore flown in from Italy apparently (staff were quick to point out that it was for sale if we wanted to bring some home - trust me, I was tempted), accompanied by a trio of dips that could also hold their own (pesto, tomato and black olive tapenade - unfortunately these are not for sale).

As we were a party of 8, we left it to the staff to fix us a platter of starters and we were not disappointed. We were presented with buffalo mozzarella, eggplant parmigiana and fried calamari (fritti) and by the end of our starters I believe we were all singing praises already. My main course, a ravioli stuffed with ricotta and porcini in a butter sauce topped with slices of bresaola (air-dried salted beef), was a beautiful balance of delicate textures and flavours. Friends had the 1kg wagyu, lobster ravioli and tenderloin. While I only managed to have a taste of the wagyu and tenderloin (which were exceptional - meaty and tender yet very light on the palate), there were no complaints across the table - everyone loved their dish.

Desserts were a different story though - we had panna cotta, tiramisu, molten lava chocolate cake and pistachio gelato - while the panna cotta was a definite standout, the rest of the offerings were rather sub-par and admittedly, I've had better elsewhere. However, despite this minor letdown, dinner was a thoroughly enjoyable affair, what with the wait staff and chef closing the night with a rendition of a classic Italian song belted out in unison.

Well appointed with a relaxed and unpretentious atmosphere serving up top class food with that homemade quality we often look out for - Baci Baci has definitely made a lasting impression; anyone and everyone ought to try it at least once."
"Excellent customer service, excellent food and memorable experience !","I reached just when the kitchen was about closed, it was late and I was hungry. The staff nevertheless greeted me smilingly, understood my situation and tried every way to make me comfortable. Though I wasn't keen for a cold salad in the starting (due to my perception of what a typical salad is like), one of the staff (Mabel) managed to turn around the situation in such a way that I can confidently say I had one of the best salads in my life. Not only were the ingredients so carefully selected and laid out, she took time to explain the whys and how's of each, that made me discover and appreciate the plate even more. Everything was perfect - the setting, the taste, the atmosphere, the smile, the wine, the music, and above all, the company, even though I was the last customer and it was late. This is what I call 'excellent customer service & excellent food'!!!
Thank you Baci Baci and Mabel for making this memorable."
Nice cosy Italian restaurant,Been there twice. It's off the main restaurant area of Serangoon Garden but worth the visit. Food is good and ambiance is homely and friendly.
Baci Baci's 1st Wine Tasting Dinner,Great pairings of wine and excellent Italian cuisine. Excellent menu for the evening. Loved the soup....such layering of flavors!
Terrific antipasto,"The large antipasto plate was excellent and so generous. The kids loved the pizza. Really nice atmosphere, pretty interiors."
Consistently Excellent,"Baci Baci is clearly establishing a new standard for Italian dining in Singapore. The high quality of the menu and wine list and the ambiance of the restaurant are both augmented by professional and friendly people and consistently excellent.
This restaurant is, by a significant margin, the most enjoyable dining experience in Serangoon"
A fantastic dining experience!!,A hidden gem amidst the residential estate of serangoon gardens. Top notch food with great service to boot! So refreshing to come across an establishment where the staff are genuinely passionate about their menu and sincerely seeking to create a fantastic dining experience! A restaurant truly worthy of the highest praise!
A Jewel,"It was my first time with friends at Baci Baci. My friends and I were very very pleased with our experience there. The ambience was cosy and charming (a quiet and good atmospheric place) the staff especially Mabel was attentive and a good host and all the food that we tried was indeed simply amazing! My most favourite dish was ‘melanzana alla parmigiana con bufala campana’. The eggplant with the sauce was so rich! The other dishes that we had were really delicious too. Look out for their Today’s Specials! For dessert, we had ‘4 dolci baci baci ‘ which consists of their mint flavoured panna cotta, lava cake (the chocolate French sauce that oozed out of the cake was heaven!), tiramisu and vanilla gelato (love the texture and taste of it!). All these were home produce. We also tried their other flavoured gelatos and their hazelnut gelato is a must have. They also have a good wine list. A hidden gem at Serangoon! I would definitely recommend this restaurant for those who would want to try good authentic Italian food."
