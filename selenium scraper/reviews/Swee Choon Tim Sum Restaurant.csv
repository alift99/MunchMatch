An excellent dim sum place at a fair price. It is open for business.,"Your page states that the restaurant is closed ‚ÄúThis restaurant is only available for takeaway or delivery at this time.‚Äù This is incorrect. The original large place is closed but they have opened a takeaway right next door and there is a sit-down place covering two large sections next to the takeaway.
1. I was with a Chinese friend who spoke to the server ‚Äì a tired looking elderly guy who is not customer oriented. So, unless you have a Chinese speaker, check it out. There are also young lady servers / helpers.
2. There is a printed menu and then you are given a sheet of paper on which you write the quantity required against the list of printed items.
3. We had pork buns, sui mai, steamed pork rib, bean curd prawn roll, fried prawn dumpling, chives pork dumpling, rice roll with prawns and har gow. The rice roll was outstanding.
4. There were large family groups in the next room ‚Äì parties of over 8 members enjoying their sumptuous lunch.
5. Some of the dishes are only available at night for dinner.
6. You pay after the meal at the counter in the second room.
7. The toilet could be cleaner!!
8. I took photos of a cook making noodles. Awesome."
Very popular diner but food could be better,"Extremely popular diner with queues outside. But it‚Äôs very basic, even extremely. Dim sums are good, sainted egg yolk excellent, but steamed pork ribs is a disaster - pieces of bones and something else, unedible."
Just a meal,"Booked from google for nothing, didn‚Äôt ask for reservations, fortunately went there early. Food is fine, some recommended didn‚Äôt suit my taste, a bit salty"
Average,"Atmosphere is good, has aircon and clean. During weekends morning there will be a queue, remember to scan their QR code to take a queue number and also scan to place an order. Dim Sum was average although the porridge was good. Overall experience 5/10."
Best dim sum in Singapore,Heard good things about this place. Very busy but got a table quickly with no need to wait. Use a QR code to order your food so quick and simple. Items are prepared in house so very fresh and tasty. Cheaper than most dim sum in Singapore. Highly recommend. Make sure you go to the one on Jalan Besar.
most worthwhile dim sum!,Affordable yet the quality and service is as good as some expensive dim sum elsewhere. This is the third time I've gone this year and I will continue to eat here!
Good and nice tim sum üëç,"Tim sum is hot and fresh. Their chicken feet is nice and their pork rik, shrimp dumplinh tasted like home made, not instant one. Those food is served fast too Service is good too, I will back again. If I wanna to eat dim sim again. My 1st choice will be sweet choon."
Nice,"Nice enough. Food was good, staff were polite. I have had better Dim Sum but overall I can‚Äôt complain! The carrot cake and custard buns were absolutely delicious, really recommend you try those"
Food was good & service was excellent.,Food was good & service was excellent. Maybe because we were the last patrons in the restaurant before their afternoon break.
First Attempt,Prices are on the high side with these settings and the he service level was prompt cos it wasn't at their peak hours.
Authentic local dimsum.,"Swee Choon Tim Sum Restaurant. Is one of the few authentic and long serving eatery offering better quality dim sum. Served in the quaint and casual setting it is a favourite amongst local diners but we came early on a Sunday morning 9am. The q already developed, quite digitalised operations as both queue and ordering from Menu are electronic/QR code based
Make up of a few shops just ajoining we managed to get tables in the original (central) section. The setup & atmosphere is somehow typical of a Hong Kong-style dim sum restaurant, but localised to suit more our taste palate.
We ordered the usual loads of feast; lui sha bao, beancurd prawn, fried red-bean paste, carrot cake ++ . Still we prefer the steamed goodies like Har gao & siew mai dumplings & chee cheong fun (rice noodle rolls drenched in a sweet soy sauce). The cheecheongfun is thin and silky, the prawn paste of the dumplings fresh and scullent.
Needless to say all the food taste nice, vying for my stomach space.. ÔÅä
Overall reasonably price breakfast of dimsum for us all."
Dim Sum Restaurant,"The atmosphere is typical of a Hong Kong-style dim sum restaurant, busy and fast-paced. I had the opportunity to visit it again after my last visit 3 years ago. This restaurant is growing and expanding. The taste of the dish is still delicious at a reasonable price."
Always delicious,Delicious Dim Sum and reasonable prices. Almost 3 years of my last visit; their food still delicious as expected but less crowded. It is worth coming to this place even though I was not staying around this neighborhood.
Century Square Branch,"They have a queue system where you scan a QR code and are then told how long before you get a table, usually between 30 mins to an hour. The delay is probably because they allow diners to have a table for an hour. Most people would finish their meals around 30 to 40 minutes, but some choose to stay for their full hour to chat, despite other diners waiting outside.

The food here was okay, though we much preferred having the meal at their main branch at Jalan Besar. Somehow, eating off the paper plates is not as satisfying and, tastewise, the food here also seemed a tad bland, even with the sweet chilli provided. The cheong fun with prawns was the best dish of the lunch, while the fan choi was a little cold and tasteless. I liked the char siu sou, which was crispy and tasty. The siew ai and harkow were run of the mill.

Staff were okay, and efficient as well."
Great Supper place,good place for late night supper. There was still quite a lot of people when we are there at around 11pm. Was very warm outdoors but indoors was full. The mee sua kueh and beancurd roll with prawn was delicious. Freshly made. They have this spicy cucumber and chicken which is really quite spicy.
Century Square Branch - Better To Dine In,"New shop at Century Sq and we decided to get some dim sum as the queue was not too long. They have two ordering machines and 1 cashier, so it could take some time if the groups ahead have difficulties using the self order machines. We got the food within ten minutes after placing our order.

Perhaps due to the 15 minute transfer home and the boxes, the paus were a little soggy. The big pau was okay, while the salted egg ones were sweet. The pan fried carrot cake was not as nice as previously, though we loved the siew mai. The crispy char siew buns, one of my faves incidentally, ended up being soggy too.

Overall, good that they are now available in the east, instead of us having to travel to Jalan Besar, but still better to be able to dine in as dim sum is always best eaten fresh and hot."
Decent food for supper spot,"The dim sum was really subpar, considering the amount of money I paid for it. I didn't find the dim sum really special, but I felt like I paid a premium price for it.

There were a lot of food choices though, and not just dim sum. I tried one of their soup noodles (forgot which one), and it actually wasn't that bad. The dim sum, as mentioned, was just at an okay standard to me.

The egg tarts looked yummy, but the pastry wasn't crispy enough for me and felt a little soggy instead. The custard bun wasn't oozing out(which is what you'll expect when you order one) and were just hard.

Some of the dishes weren't piping hot and felt a bit cold when my friends and I bit in. The XLB was one of the items, which was sad considering that the dish is supposed to be enjoyed with the hot soup inside.

I wouldn't consider coming here again on my own initiative, but I wouldn't mind if my friends suggested it and I have extra money to splurge for supper. Do take note that you have to queue for a spot as my group encountered queues even at 24:30."
Terrible Dim Sum!,"So I heard that Swee Choon is very famous for their dim sum and decided to order it online.

Never felt that cheated.

The dim sum was oily and the skin was really hard and chewy. They were so bad I had to take a second look at the order to make sure it really came from Swee Choon - the place everyone said was good... or more like just, cheap? The bad quality of the dim sum had nothing to do with the fact that they were delivered. Delivery wouldn't cause overload of oil, thick and hard doughs and general low quality.

Couldn't put ourselves to finish the food and had to throw most of them away. That's from someone who dislike wasting food.

Still couldn't believe it's famous.

."
Reasonably priced!,"When you are thinking of having dim Sum in Singapore In the middle of the night, this is the place to go. Decent dim sum At reasonable price. This place will be crowded during the weekends."
Excellent,Nice staffs and delicious food. Reasonable price and great service. We really enjoy the meal and got free soup from the Ramen chef. Thank you Will go back for sure.
Ok dim sum only,"Swee Choon has expanded a lot to three shop lots since my last visit 3-4 years ago. Went there specially for its mee sua kueh. Somehow it‚Äôs lack of the dim sum parlor vibe - probably it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a weekday afternoon. Dim sum tastes ok, not the best among all. Like the sour spicy soup and the chee cheong fun."
Just Your Average Dim Sum Place,"Came here for dinner, nothing to shout about, but will meet your appetite for dim sum. Service is good, food is average."
Tasty dium sum in Singapore!,"1st time had lunch in this dim sum restaurant (I have many 1st times with my Singaporean colleagues,they have been getting me to try all sort of good food here )

Overall feedback - tasty, fresh ingredients, creative dim sum dish, good Chinese tea Kok Po and affordable price!

I will definitely recommend this dim sum restaurant to my Malaysian friends!"
My go to dim sum place,One of the best dim sum place and it opens till 2am. They serve food pretty fast (within 10 mins) after settling down. I love all of their dishes and none of them disappoint me. Be prepared for long queues if you go there during peak hours and weekends. I think they expanded their outlet but the crowd is still huge.
Good Dim sum,"Dim sum is good. Although I won‚Äôt say all are good. We tried many items. These are our favourites are har gau, char siew Chee Chong fun, custard Pao, century egg porridge, Xiao long Pao.
They have a queue system and waiting time is about 30min during peak hours."
Very good value for money,"Visited in July for dinner with a friend. There was a queue, but it was very well organised and we only had a short wait. Good choice of reasonably priced dim sum. Efficient service. Contactless payment. Well worth another visit."
Option for Contactless Payment,"Craved for some light dim sum and decided to try our this place as recommended by so many people. Crowded.. despite a weekday night.
To ensure that patrons don‚Äôt Q up like crazy long, you‚Äôll just need to scan the bar code for Q number and wait scatteredly + adhering the safe distancing. Next, you should receive a call to notify that your table is available and head over to the host stand - have your temperature taken and retrieve your table number. Once seated, scan the bar code to place your order and within minutes, voil√†! Food is served.
Food was ok, nothing to shout about and just reasonably priced. Not sure what‚Äôs all the rave about. Didn‚Äôt expect much service but don‚Äôt particularly like the fact that staff uses her fingernail to cross out items from the order list.
So, contactless Q number (checked), contactless ordering (checked), contactless payment (nope, not a chance - CASH ONLY) WHYYY? With the current pandemic and all, why is contactless payment not an option? :(

Food - 2/5
Service - 2/5
Ambiance - 2.5/5
Value for money - 3/5

Will I come back? Unlikely. There are better dim sum elsewhere."
Super good and reasonably priced,"Wanted to try a new Dim Sum place and this restaurant had a lot of positive reviews. The food was really amazing, so tasty and seemed authentic. The service is pretty fast but you definitely have to be prepared for a wait (at least 40min). We got here to late to enjoy a second round of orders but we were satisfied with what we did get. Lots of options and we enjoyed the outdoor seating. If highly recommend trying over the chain places."
Supper at Swee Choon,Dim sum was good. Very filling and tasty. Service was fast and good. Always a great place to go for supper. Love the custard bun and xiao long baos. We will be back for more!!!!
Swee Choon Tim Sum Restaurant,"We went out of our way to try this restaurant. It was a good thing hat they were open until the late evening hours. It must have been some hidden gem that my daughter found on the internet and insisted that we dine there. In truth, this eatery has a lot of dim sum items but I didn't find the dishes we ordered that exciting. I found the prices a bit pricey and they charged us for napkins and tea. Not a eventful dining experience and would not venture back if the opportunity arises."
Good dim sum stood the test of time~,"We have patronized this eatery for a long time (though not in recent times as there are now more options and choices of dim sum restaurants and eateries). So we decided to pop-by again. As the ""circuit breaker"" social distancing measure is being implemented by the govt where no eating is allowed at all food establishments, we could only take away.

And as such, we decided to choose a number of items back home to eat. They included prawn dumpling, siew mai, char siew pao, custard bun and red bean paste bun. They are nice and yummy, and I especially like the custard bun, very flavourful though a little too sweet for me, just like the red bean paste bun.

Over time, prices have gone up but they manage to maintain the quality and so it's still a good place for HK style dim sum!"
Dine in,Dine - in for twp persons at Jalan Besar for dinner about eight o'clock at night. Waited for about 10 mis
Affordable supper spot,"Affordable supper spot - this place opens till late at night (at least till 3am?) and it has a good selection of dimsum - well known by singaporeans. Altho not the cheapest but also justified by the quality - love the doumiao, chaoshou, liushabao, meehoonkueh etc here"
Dim Sum in Little Indian,"We were looking for a non-Indian restaurant in Little India and this Chinese Dim Sum local favorite seemed to be a good choice. And it was! Absolutely delicious food - two kinds of dumplings, don don noodles, green beans with mince pork. All wonderful tastes. Typical of modern Singapore this traditional restaurant has you order on your smartphone after scanning a QR code. Very efficient, but mostly very good food at a reasonable price (not that common a quantity in Singapore.) And it‚Äôs open quite late."
Simple but tasty,"I have been eating Swee Choon Tim Sum ever since I was a little girl. As they open until late night, it has been our family favorite supper choice. From a little restaurant, they expanded to the whole row and from a simple menu of Tim sum, the variety is huge now.
That said, I still preferred the dim sum choices over the many main dishes though they are mostly nice.

My recommendations are:
Fan choy (Pork with rice) - absolute favorite that I can eat it even though I am full
Lor Mai kai (glutinous rice with chicken) - tender and flavorful
Chicken wrapped in tofu skin- order it!
Siew mai (steamed pork dumplings) - standard nice
Meesua kueh (noodle cake) - deep fried noodle that is crispy outside and soft inside. Very tasty
Big pau (buns with pork filling) - yummy
‚ÄúSaliva‚Äù chicken - spicy sauce over chicken; thumbs up!

Recently I also realised they do online delivery, which makes it super easy. Do give it a try!"
Singapore's go-to value dimsum,"Everyone knows this dimsum place in Singapore! It's open til late for supper in a convenient location, and it's the best value and quality dimsum.

I've been coming here since they only had 2 shophouse units. This was maybe a decade ago? Now they have since expanded to 4.

Must try dishes are the swee choon mee suah kueh.

This time, I came for the takeaway food - they have a dedicated counter just for it. And there's a steady stream of people!

I ordered 2 pax worth of food for 17 bucks - good deal!"
"New menu, new self service ordering mode","New menu, new self service mode where u thru your QR reader make your order, manual ordering is still available, food standard still , overall good and will be back soon thanksgood, ordered"
Fun supper spot to go to and,Fun supper spot to go to and quite convenient but expect a queue. Pretty basic but definitely value for money dimsum.
Restaurant found on internet !,"We found this restaurant on internet as we wanted to eat dim sum ... it was great, we have really enjoyed the food and the service.
Need to be tested, the way to order is quite strange the first time, but as soon as you found the way it is really easy ... you just have to fill the sheet they provide you with the quantities you want to order.
Simply great !"
Legendary Restaurant,"I really like mee-suan kueh because it's crisp outside and soft inside, the taste is good to if you combine it with chili sauce. Too bad that they don't have chili flakes oil just like other dim sum house usually has. They don't provide tissue at all but the most disappointing is they charged you for wet towels that you don't even ask for. So next time, I'll refuse the ""seems free but charged"" wet towel"
A restaurant suggestion from a local resident,"Our grab (like uber) driver suggested we eat at this restaurant for authentic dim sum. Since there was a large group of people waiting outside, we knew he was probably right. While we waited for our table, we were able to preorder. After 30 minutes, we were seated and within minutes part of our order was served. The prices were so reasonable, we had fun trying so many different and delicious dishes. This place was no frills with the star being the excellent food. Service was quite fast. Highly recommend!"
"Average food, poor service!","Food was average and forgettable. Only the mee sua kueh stood out. The cashier was especially awful. Seeing that there was a NETS machine, I asked what forms of payment they took. The cashier replied ""CASH, CASH!"". After that, we realised that we had been charged for 4 wet towels, despite us having only 2 people at the table, and that was confirmed twice before we sat down. By then, we had left the restaurant and did not bother going back.

Would definitely not return."
Great dim sum!!!,"we went here for brunch one morning and left very full and satisfied. it had been a long time since we had some authentic dim sum with quality, hand-made options (saw them making the dumplings in the side part of the restaurant!). to contrast with a lot of ""mass"" dim sum places, the steamed dishes were steamed to perfection, the fried dishes were fried well and not greasy, and none of the dishes were drowned in an oily soy sauce that is typical of other dim sum restaurants. i wanted to eat here again but the group didn't let me, lol."
Delicious Tim Sum,The dim sum was delicious and they have wide variety of choices. The place can cater for many patrons and the service was fast.
Good place for supper!,Came here with my family for supper! The food was delicious and affordable! I love their xiao long bao!
Cheap & good place to satisfy dim sum craving,"Not bad. Service is fast & efficient. Scanned the QR quote to order from menu. Once sent, e waiter came with a list of items I ordered in less than 30 seconds! Food came less than 4 minutes? I liked the porridge though there is only 1 type of porridge; minced meat & century egg porridge. Options are given whether to add century egg, minced egg or plain. Food tasted great. Quality is okay for the price. Prices are reasonable. I suggest making reservation before going so that there is no need to wait. Many tourists were eating there too so I guess it‚Äôs quite popular."
Tasty Dim Sum,"A very popular excellent dim sum restaurant in the heart of Little India ?
Couldn‚Äôt order via mobile phone as we didn‚Äôt have a local sim at the time, so ordered using the paper form and pencil method, the food arrived swiftly, being a family that loves dim sum and have tried many different restaurants we weren‚Äôt disappointed, this was good quality tasty food that was moderately priced."
Tasty traditional dim sum,"The location is easy to reach by public transport.

The service is very efficient. Start from ordering using application then withon 5 to 10 min the food was served. The waiter or waitress continuously checked whether the food has been served.

The taste of the food is really fresh and good. The food was freshly made.

Worthed to try when visiting Singapore"
Midnight Snaking!,"After an exhausting but fulfilling stroll at the Gardens by the Bay, we decided to anak it out in the area near our accommodation at Jelan Besar. You can‚Äôt miss this joint because it‚Äôs always full and we were almost caught by midnight but this place is still bustling. Tim Sum for us is dimsum and then some :) si this restaurant is a real treat.

Oh by the way they have a take out counter so you can bring home those Tim Sum to continue your snacking :)"
The real deal.,"We are visiting Singapore from Washington DC and we wanted to try Dim Sum. The DC area has many very good Dim Sum restaurants but this place blew us away. We went for lunch and were lucky to get a table as soon as we walked in. It is a fairly large place and very popular. Every table was full. We ordered about 8 dishes and everyone was better than what we get at home. Given the popularity, everything is freshly prepared and the wait staff is very friendly and professional. I scanned a QR code and could order from my i phone. We started with a few dishes, and just kept ordering in a paced out way until we were finished. The whole bill came to about $25 US! We were the only non Asians eating there so this is clearly a popular place with locals and it is not a tourist spot."
quick and easy,"Great selection and very filling. You can order on your phone, but if you don't have cell service they have a tick the box order form too!"
Local favourite for late night snacks!,"Swee Choon has been around for many years, specialised in serving dim sum late night till early morning. I have been visiting, from the days they had one store front till now when they have the entire row of shophouses facing Jln Besar Road.

Dim sum are freshly prepared. Long queue are often seen, from 11pm to 3am. It is a local favourite. If you are a tourist, I suggest to visit Swee Choon for experience."
Awesome Dim Sum!,"This place has been around since 1962!! And it was PACKED!!

Walked past it the night before and we were intrigued by the crowd. Went back the next morning but got there too early. They open at 11am. After walking around for 30 mins we came back and got seated at 11:05am. We enjoyed a very nice Dim Sum lunch and got to see the noodle man banging out some homemade noodles.

By the time we left 40 mins later, the place was already packed with a queue at the door. Will be back to this place."
Swee Choon late night Dim sum craving,"A dim sum place which stays open till 6 in the morning. For a late night dim sum craving this is the best place to go. Service is friendly and helpful. Your order will arrive very fast. It is not too expensive for what you get and it is definitely good. Not the best dim sum place ever, but still very enjoyable and good. Can be very crowded (especially in the weekend), but if you go at the right time it will be fine."
Delicious!,"I had a mouthgasm from eating here. Everything was so good! Tips: Bring cash cause they don't accept credit cards. Also, they're closed on Tuesday."
Popular and Good Dim Sum,"I came right at opening and lucky for me the line only extended from the entrance to the side of the building. I stood near the take out counter watching them prep for the day and plotting my brunch order based on the counter displays.

The restaurant seemed small from the outside but upon entering I saw there were multiple seating areas that accommodated the line of customers.

Having already predetermined my dim sum choices, I checked off each on the paper menu at my table and handed it off to the waiter. Each dish was delivered over different waves from the kitchen.

The egg tarts were ok. The fried bean curd with shrimp and taro puffs were crunchy and quite good. The shrimp dumpling did not have much wrapper but tasted good. Xiao Lin baos were nice and the spicy won ton had a lot flavor with a little kick from the spicy chili oil.

I paid at the cashier after finishing my brunch. My vacated table was quickly taken over by the next customer. No waiting to clear the plates.

Overall service could be faster but food was tasty and filling."
Cheap and good!,"Nice food for very cheap prices! The service was quite fast! however, for some strange reason, the salad arrived as last. Definitely a must try if you are in Singapore! The place itself is nothing special, a small upgrade to th interior could be great."
good supper place!,Good food at reasonable price. This place is always crowded with super long queue. Came on a weekday night and queue wasnt as long as weekend. Plenty of varieties at affordable price and open till late. Will come again.
Packed,Simply just a place to visit to enjoy great food. Note that they have long lines and always packed. Open only from afternoon till early morning. It was walking distance from our hotel so it is very convenient.
My favorite Dim Sum Place,"Love to go Swee Choon after duty. It‚Äôs was a good serving dim sum that I have eaten in Singapore. My favorites are Egg tart and Chee Chong Fun. These dishes must try in Swee Choon. I went few places for Dim Sum but still end up to Swee Choon. It‚Äôs located just really nearby Mustafa center. I remember I went to Swee Choon at the 1st time in 2014. They were 1 indoor restaurant and 1 take away counter. Alway long queue, But now you can enjoy it anytime, opens until late. they expanded their business, more seats for all customers."
Very good,Dined on 9 Sept midnight solo So sad that I could not eat many of those beauties and almost all was with pork Rest was amazing
Ok,"We had a late flight into Singapore and we were hungry. We were taken here by family as were told it was good place. The place was very busy with people standing around outside the front and most of the tables were taken. There is on street parking but is hard to find a space.

You have to go to the counter and wait till they phone you to say that the table is ready. After a few minutes we went to our table which was at the side next to the path/road. The food didn't overly take too long to come out and it tasted ok. The service was ok.

Overall this place is ok, it does get very busy so must be good. The service is ok and is ok for cleanliness. The food is ok and the place is open late so you can generally get something to eat into the early hours of the morning."
Good food,"Quite a long queue, but the food is good, nice and friendly service from the servers as well. Do come here!"
Dim Sum,Conveniently located near Jalan Besar MRT station. The restaurant offers wide range of Dim Sum dishes with affordable price. Will definitely visit again.
Great food and service,"The staff were friendly and the food was great.

We‚Äôve made a reservation via Chope, but another diner in front of us (without reservation or queuing) took our table. The staff was nice in explaining to that diner and gave us the table. Food serving was fast! The Hot & Sour Soup is a bomb!"
Unforgettable,"Okay, if you have the time, this place is a must.
1. Everyone here have said how good the dimsum is, but the pearl barley water, oh man, this mildly sweet tea-like drink ties the whole meal together.
2. I personally prefer their steamed dimsum to their fried ones, because the latter are a bit too flaky and leaves a mess.
3. Good price and authentic taste. Makes me learn how to make dimsum once I come home.
Only thing that discourages me is that I'm intimidated by them speaking really hard to hear Singlish. Most of the time I just used body language to get my order.
Just writing this review makes my mouth water."
Closed on Tuesdays,"We had originally planned to eat here on a Tuesday, but luckily learned from the reservation page that Tuesday is the one day that the restaurant is not open. We booked for a Monday at 6:00 and were seated immediately.

The menu is extensive. We opted not to order the har gao and other typical dim sum dishes. Instead, we ordered some of the more unfamiliar (to us) dishes. We also looked at what other people were eating and were not embarrassed to ask them for recommendations. We enjoyed everything.

Please note that this is a ""cash only"" restaurant. Fortunately, we were prepared and came with sufficient cash."
Dim sum you can trust,Wide range of reasonably-priced dim sums. Definitely prefer this to THW. Jyst be careful not to over order.
Wish there was a Swee Choon in California,"We dined at Swee Choon two days in a row (and perhaps would have made it three, but they are closed on Tuesdays). We visited on a Wednesday and Thursday for lunch (around 1pm/1:30pm) and were lucky that there was no queue. We ordered the pork spare ribs, Peking dumplings, cold tofu with century egg, spicy won tons, spicy won tons in noodle soup, glutinous rice with chicken, mango pudding, Portuguese egg tart, and steamed salted egg yolk buns. Everything we ordered was delicious and fresh.

Swee Choon is not a fancy, upscale restaurant, but rather, it is a no frills place to go for good food. You wait in a queue, check off your order on a menu, and wait for your food to arrive to your table. Service is efficient and there is a bell at your table to ring if you need attention. It is important to note that if you use the wet napkins on the table, you will be charged a nominal fee. Same goes for every glass of water you drink. Swee Choon is cash only, and you pay at the register once you are done. The biggest challenge for us was not eating until we were too stuffed to move. The food is so good, you just want to keep eating!

We would recommend coming on a weekday during late lunch to avoid a queue. Swee Choon closes at 2:30pm for lunch and then opens from 6pm to 6am. We heard from Singaporeans that this is a popular dim sum spot after the bars or clubs due to its unusual hours. There is a takeaway storefront at Swee Choon, so in case there is a queue or you want to take some good food to go, that is an option as well. We are sad to leave Singapore and Swee Choon and would love to start a petition to bring one (or many) to California!"
Best dim sum- line is worth waiting,"Hotel concierge recommended this local dim sum 1 block away. Long cue but well worth the wait, even for separate take-away. Inexpensive, fresh and wide range of traditional dim sum and noodle dishes. Highly recommend. Open late."
Great supper option,Food came quickly and it was very affordable!! However there were long queues so would be wise to go before opening hours :)
Best dim sum in Singapore,"The dishes tasted good and the prices are reasonable. Should go before open hour because it's have a lot of que. However, the turn-over are high enough."
affordable late night supper,great place if you are looking to try out dim sum or if your are looking for supper late at night. reasonably price and always packed. most of the food there is good. most of the staff there are chinese though
one of the best dim sum in town,"Just as a Dim Sum Restaurant should be. Great food, plastic chairs, service which hardly speaks English...... this place makes me feel like I am visiting China, very authentic, Dim Sim absolutely fantastic"
Fresh and good,"The dishes tasted good and the prices are reasonable - what a great combo.

We ordered the xiaolongbao, salted egg custard buns, Beijing dumplings, siew mai, egg tarts, hsr siu buns, deep fried shrimp dumplings and wontons, and they all were delicious. We also had har kow and char siu sou and they were not as tasty, but nonetheless still fresh.

Do note that they do not accept credit cards, buy only cash or Nets. They are also closed on Tuesday evenings."
Best dimsum place ever,"Love all the dimsum here. Came here a thousand times with friends, still love it. Maybe a bit more expensive but the food is worth it"
Delicious dim sum and great value!,This was our second time visiting Swee Choon. We absolutely love the different choices of dim sum and think it's incredible value for an authentic dim sum experience. We particularly enjoyed the Egg Custard Tart and the Char Sieu pastry. We arrived shortly after 6pm for dinner to avoid having to wait for a table. Last time they only took cash but it appears that they now also take card!
Lunch,"They open @ 1100. No credit cards, cash only. The food was OUTSTANDING and very reasonably priced. Their menu has the names in Chinese & English plus pictures. I ate 2 dim sum appetizers & their spicy noodle soup & was full 29.10 Singaporean, ridiculously inexpensive for such good quality. Watch the chef make the noodles, amazing."
A night with my love,A reasonable price. amazing food and wonderfull dim sum ever had in orchad road. friendly staff. thankx alot
Worth it,Went there at 10:30pm (22:30) and it was hopping! A long wait but you know a place is good when you see locals swarming it and ready to wait right with you. Food was delicious and we got takeaway so maybe total wait was 15mins from start to finish. Very inexpensive. Will go back before we leave Singapore!! Highly recommend!!
Prepare to wait a while after 6:30,"We went at about 6:15 and it was just open at 6. If u want to swat aircon area, prepare to wait half an hour. We chose the open air area. What‚Äôs good are the non usual timsum like the layer cake pork floss. Traditional ones taste good too. Worth the trip to come. Choose different tea and u will be given individual pot!"
Best Dimsum place in Singapore,"Whenever I crave for dimsum, I will always drop by here to satisfy my cravings. They serve good dimsum at affordable prices. Good for groups to go!"
Not bad,Decent place to have dim sum however not great. Was quite crowded at night when I went. Price is alright.
Affordable and nice La mien and prawn chongfan,"I must say this restaurant is very crowded and took 25 min for me to get table for 11 people.

1st time came here, after read review on the net.

Traditional resto, heard it expanded and larger now.

The star of the dish was the la mien and prawn chongfan.
Recommended to have it when you eat here.

While others ok.

I guess this is the affordable dim sum in Singapore and taste is ok.

Service Ok.
Just the toilet need to be upgraded."
Enjoyable value-for-money dim sum,Always a crowded place but with a reliable queue management system to facilitate the crowds. Love the carrot cakes and mee sua cakes. Its worth trying as many as their recommended items on the menu. Good to go in a group so you can order more food. Prices are reasonable.
Supper spot,It is a popular supper spot amongst locals. The taste of the food is nothing spectacular and the price is on the higher side.
Nice dim sum,"The price and the taste was so worth the wait. A lot of tables so we will not wait too long, the food also very fast served. Highly recommend Sew Mai and Hor Fun. Not far from lavender MRT and it is about 10 minutes walk from mustafa center."

One of Famous Dim Sum in Town,"Visited Swee Choon like few times, but to be honest, I didn't find all dim sum has a very tasty flavor. But overall is just ok. You should give a try yourself, everyone has different palate. But bear in mind, this place is always crowded, if you're planning to visit during lunch or dinner time, please come earlier as the q might be long."
Lunch at Swee Choon,Was there at 11.15 on a weekday and got nice seats. We ordered couple of dishes...Egg tarts was good. Crowd started streaming in at 1145 and was bustling.. Service was good. Food quality good.
Amazing dim sum until early hours of the morning!!!,We ended up going here as we were out until late at the cinema. It was around 12.30 am when we visited. The place was buzzing.. super service too. They have quite a variety of dim sum on offer. All made freshly at reasonable prices
