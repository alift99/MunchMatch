"not bad, not great.","No real complaints, but wont exactly be raving about it to anyone or craving to head back. places that makes the masses."
"Attentive service, great food!","Came on a weekday afternoon, not crowded at all and food was served fast. Suitable for big groups as well. Will come again"
Don’t bother,Medium rare strip loin came almost well done. Grilled half shelled scallops came cold. Gordon ramsey would have a field day here for his kitchen nightmares series.
"Simple set up, easy dining but not much thought","From something to look forward to, it was just a simple visit. Not much thoughts given to us. Forgot the birthday candle I requested for, embarrassing…. Zzz"
Good food,"Grilled items were good - we had the ribeye steak, pork tomahawk and chicken. Would recommend the beef ragout pasta too."
Ribeye is good,"Tried all the lunch sets and pasta was disappointing, however the ribeye steak is good! Hope to see better lunch sets, it’s fuse free especially for weekday work lunches."
Awesome Food,What an amazing experience. It was really delicious and we all enjoyed the food! Restaurant is aesthetically pleasing as well!
Good food but customer service could have been better,"Food was good but the female staff wasn't friendly. Called to make table reservation the previous time she was not helpful and speak in unfriendly tone. Eventually decided to cancel the reservation. Second time was a nice guy who took reservation over the phone. On the day itself, was attended to by a lady which I believe was the same lady whom I spoke to the first time. She was not friendly in person either. Bad experience I would say. Also the place was pretty warm, few of us were perspiring."
"Good Food, Affordable Drinks","Quality food, nice range of western menu. Drinks promo are attractive. Be sure to reserve your seats early."
Cozy & vibrant place for hang out with friends,"Cozy & lively place for hang out with friends after work. Food is so so; drinks are average price. I like the ambience, not too noisy but vibrant."
Nice meal and ambiance!,"2nd time here but this time we had the lunch set and it was the Christmas menu. Every thing was awesome and great. Food came on time, no awkward waiting. Serving was just nice! People there is nice too, will check with us time to time. Absolutely love the panna cotta! Will be back again! :)"
"Very disappointing food, service was okay.","The ambience was ok, a bar and restaurant setting with ample fans ensuring the area was cool and comfortable. Service was ok, servers were friendly and came over regularly to refill our glasses of water. The food was disappointing though. We ordered the pork tomahawk which is their signature, pasta bolognese, ribeye, seafood risotto, and pistachio melts.

The bolognese was very moist, and was only as good as a typical 'kopitiam' standard (and I'm not saying say this in exaggeration). The base tasted like it was taken out of a Prego instant tin sauce. The ribeye was acceptable - served in the exact doneness as we requested, but was rather bland. The risotto was also bland, with little flavours of seafood in the rice.

The Iberico pork tomahawk was ok, meat was sweet and sauce was good. But the meat is tough and the side pistachio crust didn't taste pistachio at all, in fact it had an aftertaste of the Chinese pork floss. Then came the dessert which was also disappointing. The pistachio larva cake tasted nothing like pistachio, and the pandan-flavoured ice cream though good, was so strong in taste that it covers the flavour of the pistachio larva cake.

Overall it was disappointing. The service and the friendliness of the servers were the only reasons I gave two stars. This is the Boon Tat outlet."
Unexpected birthday surprise,"The food was delicious & the staff were attentive and excellent. Serving with a smile. As I booked through the chope app, I was pleasantly surprised that they served dessert on the house coz it popped out. Will definitely return."
Oily food and subpar service,Food was too oily. Staff had poor attitude towards service. The price for 3 pax dining is high for the quality of food.
pleasant food at FYR,service is great and we had an enjoyable food. Love the time and food there. Really enjoy the time there. Thank you! the braised beef is yummy!
Underwhelming and no value,"Having paid 340+, for a party of 4, and this was a slight discount for amex love dining (but I must state there were a huge number of restrictions), I couldn't see the value.

Was a mini celebration so I was open to spending more. The wagyu was sad, and the tomahawk was 10$ cheaper than a much better one at Opus. The only dish to come out with any merit was the beef short ribs which was very tasty (all my 2 stars are here).

Wouldn't go back again even if I had a 50% discount.."
Scrumptious Lunch,"Took my intern for lunch here. Food was served fast, it was delicious and the team was attentive, polite. I hv recommend to my friends and will visit here again.."
Not that great,"Went for a weekday lunch here to try something different after seeing past reviews, but left unimpressed and disappointed. Food was pricey and over salted, a few popular options on the menu were unavailable and service was not that great."
"Great Food, but service slightly slow","The food was really good! We had the Kurobuta Pork Collar and Ribeye, and they were really grilled nicely. However, the service was quite slow although by the time we were there for dinner, it was already later than usual so the dinner crowd is lesser, and not all the tables were filled. We waited around 45mins for our food. Nonetheless, the service staff were really nice and friendly! I would definitely go back again for the food, but maybe on less busy timings."
Nice Fusion Foods,"Recently my wife and I had pretty nice lunch here. FYR, which is surprisingly to be pronounced like ‘Fire’ serves fusion asian & western type of foods.
We ordered their Aglio Olio based pasta with prawn and Rib Eye steak, which both taste pretty nice and enjoyable. We also ordered their mushrooms with poached egg soup which taste really2 good.
The ambience is quite nice, service is pretty fast and efficient. Pricing is considered medium up, but quite reasonable."
Expensive and so so food!,"Not sure why so so good about this restaurant by other comments. Paying too much for a piece of meat that doesn’t even taste good. The tomahawk is kind of average and the pork collar is so bad that I almost give up eating.. so hard and overcooked! The fried chicken wing is kind of average but grilled oyster kind of unique with sambal spicy sauce added. The paella is real disappointing as it just like eating your typical rice cook at home with added sauce. This is a Spanish paella and not the chinese seafood rice.. taste bland and the rice not cooked to the perfection as Spanish style... the drink is also expensive.. beer @$14 . Environment is casual but when walk to toilet, you can see the kitchen cleanliness and hygiene. The service is great but unfortunately the food quality and price not worth my visit again!"
Nice and cosy setting with awesome food!,Nice and cosy setting with great food and a good choice of beverages. Food was amazing and super well seasoned that I really enjoyed it!
Nice and casual environment for a drink and meal.,"Had a few small dishes (pork belly, octopus, croquettes and duck foie gras) along with some mains (pasta and pork collar). The dishes are flavoursome and best to have after 1-2 drinks. There is also a good bar area for people to have a few drinks and small bites. Definitely a good place for a small group catch up."
Birthday Celebration with friends,"Came for a birthday celebration on a weekday night, and utilised our entertainer 1 for 1 w sides and dessert. Have to say that the portions are pretty small. Our entertainer allows us to order 4 mains (3 meat dishes and 1 carb), 2 sides and 2 dessert but we were not quite satisfied after the meal, we were still hungry and have to head somewhere for more food."
Good location,"Learnt fyr is called fire. We visited for seeking something new. We ordered three courses. No scallops for starter. Instead, they have Shimeji, cauliflower ,or watermelon. Main had a good portions. Taste was average. Main Fish and chips were huge but too greasy. Overall average."
Creative and out of this world!!,Why didnt I find this out earlier!! An immense experience. Delight to the soul. The short ribs was magnificently done. Other dishes by my family were great experience too. Wide choices. We all agreed we must come back again!! Great job FYR!!
Lovely Experience,Had my anniversary with my girlfriend at this restaurant. The atmosphere was very comforting. I booked a reservation and the table that was reserved for me had my name and it was nicely decorated. My phone’s battery was low so they allowed me to charge my phone at their restaurant ! The waiters/waitresses were Super friendly as well as they attended to every of our need. I recommend trying their Lamb Rack & their Pistachio Malt ( dessert ) it’s the 2 things I enjoyed eating the most there ! I recommend this restaurant. Very hospitable as well.
Excellent Service,"I thought the food was good, nothing mind-blowing but the pork was well cooked, the oysters and foie gras were good and the pasta could have been better (sorry guys I'm just more picky about my pasta and I love the taste of freshly made pasta when I eat out). The standout here was truly the service, the staff was friendly, patient and kind and I thoroughly enjoyed my evening with them. Food was priced reasonably. Will head back again some time."
Food quality pretty good but over priced.,"Food quality pretty good. Pricing is on the high side . Had medium rare Ribeye. Cut is above average and tender.

Dessert choices is very limited . 2 choice only .

This area parking is also limited . Suggest take public transport ."
Excellent grill,"The grilled dishes (almost all of them are) were perfectly cooked and delicious! The wine selection is limited and half of those on the list were not available. That was disappointing. The service is a bit all over the place, but they make up for lack of speed and attention with friendliness."
Meat and beer!,"This is a great place to have guys quality meat and great beer eating / drinking session! To be honest, I over ate as it was too good! The ambience and service was friendly and the price reasonable."
lunch,ordered a takeaway meal box of ribeye and fries. wanted to order the foie gras ala carte but unfortunately it was not available. will be back soon to try others.
"Original menu , too salty margaritas","I loved the menu, and the food was really delicious.
The atmosphere and music was nice too, its great for a date.
Only one thing was disappointing was the margaritas that are WAY TOO salty! (in the glass, outside the glass, it was hard to finish"
Best combo red wine n ribeye,Great ribeye but mine was served with lots of fats... red wine was great pairing with the steak :) Used 1 for 1 entertainer for this.
First Visit to fyr,"Ordered snapper fillet and Ribeyes with small plate of Wagyu beef. Fish is very tasty but Ribeyes is over cook and not pipping hot Tables are small and seats are very close to the next table so quite uncomfortable. If there is no promotion, the food doesn't justify the price with the environment."
Great food great ambience,"The medium rate lamb shank was amazing. My to-go order all the time.

If you're a stout lover, highly recommended to try their stout with cinnamom sugar. Its a brilliant combination."
Food was good but service was hopeless,Do not go to FYR for lunch if you are looking for a quick lunch in the middle of a business day. We waited for our food for a good 30 mins and all we ordered was a simple steak and chicken.
Disappointed with the service,Waiter gave the wrong information. In the end the chope voucher bought is unable to use for set lunch. Had to fork out double the amount to use the voucher. Disappointed!!
"Good mains, overpriced and small portions","We had the pork chop $48 and steak $40 for mains. Potato gratin and brussel sprouts for sides, $10 each. Also had a virgin mojito $10.
Mains were yummy albeit too small a portion to fill my hungry partner. I dont usually finish a full serve so it was ok for me.
Sides, brussel sprouts were really yummy!! - never thought I would enjoy brussel sprouts. Potato gratin was kinda gross, it was watery which lead us to think - is it undercooked??!
Virgin mojito - average.
Overall for food, pricey for the small portion. Would I have brussel sprouts again for $10? probably not.
Service wise, they were really friendly and I have no issue, very good.
Atmosphere, space was quite tight. tables were a little too close for comfort and privacy."
Perfect Date Night,"My girlfriend and I were on date night after we both ended work on a Friday night. We were welcomed by very friendly and cheery staff of the restaurant. My girlfriend wasn’t too hungry so we decided to just go with 1 main. We ordered the Seafood Rice, Brussels Sprouts, Grilled Fresh Oysters and Paprika Fries with Truffle Mayo. We also ordered a bottle of Shiraz. The food and ambience was absolutely amazing, combined with the excellent service of the staff, I dare to say that it’s worth every penny. Thank you FYR for the perfect date night :’)"
Farewell Lunch for Colleague,"Ambience was warm and pleasant. Wait staff were attentive. Food was awesome though a lil pricey. Overall, wonderful experience. Am planning another visit soon."
Delicious brunch,"Ordered grilled oysters, wagyu meatballs linguine and a dessert. All done beautifully. Service was excellent; the staff was able to attend to every patron quickly. The way she communicates also makes people feel relaxed and comfortable. It’s not easy considering she was the only one there juggling all the work. Overall, a very pleasant dining experience! Oh yes, do check out the vouchers that you can purchase via Chope. The savings was significant and everything tasted even better."
Birthday Meal,"We visited the restaurant on a weekday night and ordered 1 small plate, 2 mains, 1 desserts and 1 cocktail. We saw reviews that the baked Camembert cheese was excellent and was slightly disappointed as there wasn't much of a taste to the dish. Mains were prime ribeye and pork tomahawk. Similarly the tomahawk was tough and disappointed. However the ribeye was cooked to perfection, right tenderness and marinated just right. Dessert was pistachio melt which is an innovative dish similar to the concept of chocolate lava cake! Cocktail was a different G&T, light and refreshing. Service was also attentive and prompt! I would definitely visit the restaurant again for other dishes!"
Great meal,"The food was good, service was attentive. we had the oysters and the croquettes for starters, both were very good. for mains the bone-in short ribs was melt-in-your-mouth tender, rib eye steak and lamb were both flavourful."
Good food and nice lunch,"Reasonably priced set lunch and food is quite good. Loved their fish and dessert, come here often with friends to catch up for lunches on weekdays and will definitely be back. My friend chose chicken which was unfortunately quite dry. Always packed during lunchtime so be sure to make reservations."
Good service,"The waitresses were friendly and tactful in dealing with situations. thumbs up to them. The beef $48 I had however, was not good; hard and dry, did not look appetizing. I had since feedbacked this to the staff and I hope it will be worked on so it is good for future diners moving on. On the other hand, the duck leg was very good. $5 for free flow of papadums too awesome!"
Excellent food and service as usual,"Managed to book a table for 6 on Chope for a friday night (which the restaurant is usually fully booked), only downside is the pre-authorisation on the credit card for bookings of more than 5 pax.

Food and service was excellent by the staff as usual, would definitely be back."
"Food is not bad, short or staff","Food is nice but good with entertainer deal. Kinda short of staff and some are not attentive, overall not bad experience"
Great experience,"My friend recommened this place. The settings was great, the staff write your name on a stone indicating your reservation. We use that stone all the way to take photo of every dish. Ambience was superb, love the music they played (great song list chosen)"
"Good quality food, great service, good location","Second time I have eaten lunch at Fyr. Made my reservation on Chope, with a 50% mains Chope exclusive code. Greeted at the door and shown to table. Prompt to take order and top up water.
Good menu options, well cooked, good portion size. Had to remind them to use the discount code at the end of the meal."
Will be back again and again,"Second time back here, the experience was even more awesome. And with the entertainer app, you just can’t ask for more. Had the kurobuta pork and beef ribs, can’t decide which was actually better. Can’t go wrong with either. And the octopus leg....OMG"
Lunch,"We had set lunch, the restaurant was packed; kitchen was slow. There was a group of more than 12 pax ahead of us, we waited for more than 30 mins for main course. Mushroom soup was yummy but cold, the barramundi was salty. The Ribeye my friend ordered was too salty and came as medium well instead of medium rare. Plus point was the dessert of the day, fruit tart. Overall experience was not pleasant as the wait was too long during lunch hours."
Farewell Lunch at FYR,"Took the FYR set lunch
Entree - Mushroom soup >> Nice but a little salty
Main - Pan fried Barramundi >> Love this dish!
Dessert - Strawberries with meringue > Perfect!"
Good Ribeye,I found the Prime Ribeye very good! Highly recommend it for those who like a good steak. The garden green is quite a big portion so it’s good to share.
"Hidden gem, definitely will frequent","The wait team was a small one and mostly only talked to this friendly female. The food was superb with a suitable waiting time and the ambience and song selection was very apt, providing chill vibes that matched the theme of the restaurant."
Excellent tapas and cocktails,Great service and cocktails. Grilled oysters are a must as well as baked camembert. Get the larger portion of each as you will finish it regardless. Reservations recommended. Close to Amboy and Club St afterwards.
Steak was disappointing,"Ordered the ribeye. Asked for medium raw, it came medium raw indeed with all the pink inside but it was dry, the surface was dry. The steak has no beef taste and you need to sauce else it is just chewing plain meat."
Chillax place with nice vibe,"Was pleasantly surprised to see my name nicely written on the reserved table, food was hearty and good. Ambience chill and had a nice vibe for sure. Great for a weekend brunch or lunch for groups and family."
FYT,"Excellent service, food and wine. The
Cheese starter, Brussel sprouts and steak were delisciou. Not fans of the gratin potatoes. We'll be back!"
Didn't live up to expectations,"What we ate tasted nice but nothing stood out. The portion size of the sides was tiny and given we were a large group, it would have been nice to get some suggestions from our server as to how much to order to cater for us all. We ordered platters as well as other smaller dishes and everything was delivered to one end of the table, meaning we had to pass large heavy platters along. One of our dishes was chicken and we sent it back to be cooked because it was raw. Our server was quite rude when she stated it was cooked sous vide but the chicken was bleeding pink so no, it wasn't cooked. It was taken back to the kitchen to be recooked and then rudely returned with an air of attitude. Not a great way to treat your paying customers. I doubt very much that I or my friends will return to this restaurant."
Lunch - Unfortunate experience,"We heard wonderful reviews about service and food at fyr. So we specially took leave to visit this restaurant for lunch. Very unfortunately we were served by an unhappy Chinese waitress who made us feel we are unwelcome.

Perhaps we were late for our reservation timing. But we did call in to postpone. Parking was also a challenge during lunch hours. Yet I don’t see why this Chinese waitress needed to talk down to us.

To be fair, the Filipino waitress was very professional and friendly. Food was above average. Service-wise, I believe it’s not an accurate representation of fyr in general. But unfortunately this is our experience.

To the Singaporean Chinese waitress: If we missed the lunch hours for your restaurant, we have no problem taking it elsewhere. There is no need for such high attitude."
It Always feels like home,"I first stumbled upon this cosy lil place 2 yrs ago and I’ve been coming back since.
Good food and wine is what I look for in a restaurant not forgetting Friendly staff. And believe me they’ve got all of that and MORE! I have practically eaten almost every dish listed on their menu. My family loves it! My friends love it!
My fav items are definitely the oysters, prawns, scallops, lamb and I’d go on if you have the time Pls don’t leave without trying their desserts!
My fav wine is their Chianti
Their winning item isn’t listed on the menu btw....
It is the warmth of the staff that makes you feel so welcomed!
Don’t miss out!"
Fantastic food with friendly service and great ambience,"Had a great experience at this place! The drinks were absolutely delicious and so were the mains. We ordered a variety of meats - lamb neck, pork ribs and pork collar. All three dishes were stunning to look at and tasted just as good. In addition, the staff was extremely attentive and friendly. Ambience is classy, but still cool and quite upbeat. Only complaint would be that the mains took too long to come our to us, but the staff did address our enquiries perfectly."
Surprisingly good food and service,"They write your name on a little stone tablet propped up on an easel if you've made a reservation. Cute.

Surprisingly decent food. Seafood paella with chorizo was delicious, and the beef short ribs in red wine were tender and flavourful. Foie gras small plate was rather stingy in terms of portion size, but very good. Asparagus with garlic was also very good."
Excellent service and food,"Made a call to tell staff that we like to come 1 hour earlier from our reservation timing, and service staff was agreeable and remembered upon our arrival.

They were quick to serve us and refill our waters whenever it is half filled

Ordered the lamb ribs starter, it was tender and the sour sauce to complement with it was paired so well! A little small for my liking for the price, but then again, quality is there.

Had the ribeye steak and iberico pork mains and it was charred well with juiciness in the middle of the slab of meat."
Amazing service and great food,"The service was amazing and food’s great. My medium rare ribeye was delicious and the pistachio melt dessert was not overly sweet, great meal altogether"
"Great food, good vibes, excellent service","Had a table reserved for two and arrived rather earlier than expected, but found ourselves happily surprised when the table was already ready. (it also had a cute little chalk slate with my name on it).

No complaints about the food here, we had the lamb rack and the seafood thingy, but the highlight for me was the service. The service staff were wonderful, attentive and friendly.

Definitely coming back!"
Delicious,"Located along the busy stretch of restaurants of Boon Tat Street, the restaurant has both outdoor and indoor seating. You would likely need a reservation judging from the crowd here, and we were given a 2 hour dinner window to finish our food as well.

Food was delicious, each dish carefully prepared. Ambiance was pretty chill, Witt mostly high table seating."
Good value 3 course set lunch,"This is near our office so we had set lunches here. The 3 course set consist of appetiser, main and dessert. At $25++, it’s pretty good value and v filling! The place is packed during peak lunch hours but service was still prompt and they made it a point to serve all at the table at the same time. I took pics of the desserts as they are so pretty!"
Good set lunch!,"Great food without melting your credit card! Set meal had lots of choice. All 3 dishes were tasty, interesting and good quality."
"Interesting dishes, great service","Service was great. The staff were always smiling, polite and helpful even though they seemed understaffed and were juggling requests from many tables. They never showed their frustration.
The seafood chorizo rice was delicious, generous portions of seafood. However, the octopus squid ink was not so. The octopus was pungent, like it had not been cleaned well. We could not have more than a few bites of this dish.

A pity we could not try desserts and there is a time limit on the seating.
Make sure to make reservation before coming, it was packed on a Friday night."
Awesome service value for money,"super waiting staff just that my table was a lttle hidden just a matter of getting the attention, food was good as always and perfect ambience."
Excellent food and service! A must-visit(:,"Visited with my date on Friday evening. Had the duck foie gras, scallops, prawns & chirozo rice, bone-in short ribs, and pistachio melt with pandan ice cream. Every dish was well done, especially the dessert. Ambience and service were great as well. Will definitely be back for more! :)"
Very tasty food and good service!,Really tasty meat dishes and very good service in a funky environment. Not a huge wine list but ok. I will definitely go back!
"Good but not great value, better portions for steak.",Enjoyed a lot but in sg there are better steak options. Not good value. Suggest to consider other options.
Pretty awesome dishes!,"The tuna belly and beef steak for starters were awesome! For the mains, the chicken was great but the fish was a little overcooked. The pistachio and pandan dessert is a must try! The chocolate cake and mousse is pretty decent too."
Dinner at Fyr,Totally love this place! The service was good and so was the food. We really had a good time there!!
Pork chop is very dry and food is overpriced,"Pork chop is very dry and food is overpriced. The dessert chocolate tart however is quite good, compared to main."
Great food,"Try the short ribs are soft and juicy combine with brusell sprout, the dessert is okay.. overall we enjoy our dinner"
Quite disappointed,quite disappointed that the servings are so much smaller compare to our order a few months ago. we used the entertainer app to eat but my experience using the app is that the serving size shouldnt be sacrificed. really disappointed as i had some friends with me to celebrate my birthday. there are also flies while we were having dinner which is annoying. servers are not that attentive too.
Great service staff,"Booked via Chope for my father's birthday for 6 pax. The service staff were super friendly and we really enjoyed our time there. Foodwise, the steak and rice were great. The lamb was a little tough. Will return to try the tomahawk."
Great food! Good ambience,Had been wanting to go to this restaurant for some time. Found this place to have good ambience (quiet) and serves good food! The Steak & egg is very value for money given the quantity. The food quality is good too! Will go back again!
Nice lunch and drink,"50% of main course during lunch time but portion is average, the duck confit was good!! Recommend!!!"
Nice place,Love the food! The staff were friendly and service was good. Had a few refills without me asking. It was at a good price because of the 50% discount promo
Fantastic Food!,"Great ambience and awesome food. The Tomahawk Steak, Crispy Iberico Pork Belly and Duck Foie Gras are must trys! Brussels Sprouts and Asparagus sides are fantastic accompaniments to the steak. A good range of whiskeys to go along and wash erm all down."
Awesome Set Lunch,"It's a must try restaurant. We came here for a business lunch and I am amazed with the food.. the service is impeccable. We will surely come back to try the dinner menu soon.. Great job guys,keep it up!"
Nice food,Set lunch price is reasonable. Variety is good. However the place can be pretty noisy. So if you prefer a quiet place then might not be ideal. Other than that. All is good
"Average and small food portions, hidden T&C.","Wanted to find a decent steak joint featured on the Entertainer app and came across FYR which seemed to have several good reviews.

Called them to reserve a table - apparently I needed to provide my credit card details via a link in order to do so. And no shows would incur a cancellation fee / pax. First time I’ve encountered this type of thing when making a reservation - usually I would be told that the table would be held 15 mins for me, simple as that. Anyway did as asked and looked forward to trying this grill with my family.

On the day of the event, I get a text to confirm my reservation with a statement that there was a second seating for my table at 830pm? My reservation was for 7pm and they expected me to dine in 1.5 hours inclusive waiting time for the food ?! I don’t think it was nice to already feel like the restaurant was chasing us out before even arriving and to be told about 2nd seating on the day itself was not right too. I understand some eateries are “popular” and small hence need to cater 2nd seating but let me know at point of reservation so that I can make a more informed decision whether or not to proceed.

Arrived at the restaurant and clarified on use of entertainer app vouchers with staff - there was a voucher with 1 for 1 main course and dessert and a few vouchers with 1 for 1 main courses. The staff claimed that the 1 for 1 main course and dessert voucher could “only be used mon - Thursday” and that it was stated in the app. I went back to my seat to check - it was not stated but I did not want to argue.

Waited quite awhile for our food and taste wise ok but was underwhelmed by the meagre portions. Seriously steak with a sliced up tomato?? No carb side accompaniment like fries/ baked potato? They did have other sides for ordering on the menu but very limited choices. A request for medium rare steak also wound up as a medium well piece. I would have been very unhappy paying the listed price of the steak dish had it been full price paid.

Service was polite enough however overall unsavoury experience."
Very bad experience,"Not only did the owner not try to accomodate the customer's request, she also speak very rudely to customer. Not professional. The worst experience we have ever encountered"
"Love the place, the food and the staff!",The food was yummy and the staff were super friendly! already booked for our next lunch! the portions were just right and price was reasonable as well.
Food,"Food was good, service was good. Reserved this restaurant, u are required to pay $10 per diner as deposit. I reserved for 6 but one of my friend can’t make it. We definitely ate more than 6 persons’ share, we have 5 sides, 4 mains n 1 btl of wine. I still being charge for 1 diner who didn’t turn up."
Great service,The ambience was great and the food was alright. Would recommend this venue for gatherings with friends.
"Great food, greater service!",Great food and great service as always. Been here numerous times and never once disappointed! Great job guys.
"Great food, great service","Steak was delicious, got the sear just right with the rare doneness the way I like. Service staff are polite and attentive. The menu may be being rather limited but if that means they upkeep the standards of the food, by all means!"
Impeccable service and delicious food,"We went to this place for my girlfriend's birthday. I went there earlier and was greeted by the staff. The table was set up already, with the name of the person who booked the table, and everything was in order. The staff were polite and welcoming, especially Sebastian, who was especially friendly. Sebastian also assisted in keeping the birthday cake which I brought along.

We used the Entertainer application, which had 1-for-1 mains, and ordered 4 items:

1. Iberico Pork;
2. Prime Ribeye;
3. Snapper Fillet; and
4. Scallops, Prawn & Chorizo Rice.

We also ordered the:

1. Cauliflower Gratin; and
2. Ratatouille.

For desserts, we ordered:

1. Warm Chestnut cake
2. Black sticky rice; and
3. 2 x Pistachio Melt & Pandan Ice Cream.

The desserts came with the Entertainer app.

Overall the food and service was excellent. The ambience of the restaurant along with the efficiency of the service staff made the whole experience even more enjoyable.

One should however note if using the app, that the restaurant will charge the most expensive mains, so it would be prudent to first plan what to order accordingly.

10/10 would recommend! Once again, thanks to Sebastian for making the meal so delightful"
"Great Food, Great Service","We had Foie Gras, it was different, had a local twist to it BUT didn’t disappoint. Flavours are excellent. The most unforgettable, the pandan and pistachio dessert! A MUST TRY."
Food was great but rushed dinner,"My first visit to fyr was awesome, and the iberico pork is highly recommended. I’ve decided to celebrate my birthday there with my family but this second time round the atmosphere wasn’t fantastic. I was being reminded thrice that I had to leave at 8:30pm for the 2nd seating (I went at 7pm). In the end I was handed my bill at 7:53pm with the waiter saying that it’s time for the 2nd seating. I mean the servers were polite and friendly but I felt very rushed, especially for a birthday celebration, and of course I know there is a 2nd seating since I have been told from the moment of the reservation confirmation and reminded that few times throughout the dinner. I feel that the servers can cut down on the no of times of reminders since it has already been told during confirmation. The food was great but the portion for the small plates (bigger size) were still small, so bear that in mind it’s tapas size.
In the end, we had to go elsewhere for a 2nd round since our dinner at fyr was only 1 hour and not filling with 4 dishes (subjective ofc).
Not the perfect place for a celebration during first seating, so go if u are looking for quick, good meal."
"Great service, great food","Been there a few times because they are part of the Amex love dining program. Every time I’m there, it’s always been great service. And I think I have gone there so many times that they probably recognise me.

Dishes to try - grilled oysters, iberico pork."
"Quick, friendly and tasty","Great little space open on a quiet Sunday for lunch. Friendly service and a tasty scallop, prawn and rice dish that arrived promptly. Topped off with a crisp MAC’S wheat beer"
Rude service / terrible experience,"Had a pretty unpleasant experience in Fyr. Waiter kept move my glass and forks to my left side (I’m a righty) for his convenience of placing other dishes. Another waitress spoke quite recklessly when we questioned about the coupon. She insisted to not be responsible for any promotion of the restaurant and most of her reply to our queries were “no Mdm” “ can’t Mdm”. We were treated quite badly. They sold $25 coupon worth $50 and noted that to only be “used” during 9-10pm. The waiter then declined our coupon saying we had to step in the restaurant after 9 and bill before 10pm. Waiter accused us of not reading the T&C. Asked them to show us in the T&C and they couldn’t actually find it. Then their language started to be a bit blunt that I felt like I was scolded. On TOP of all these, the food itself was quite mediocre. 2 half-sized starter and 2 main course, plus 4 glasses of bourse wine. We ended up paying $160. We were quite annoyed with the dining experience here. Won’t recommend at all."
