Fresh food and excellent service,"Excellent service. Went beyond expectation. We had no booking so arrived to a fully booked restaurant. One of the owners took our name and contact number; said ‚Äòcome back in about 30 mins‚Äô. He then called us to say a table was ready and was waiting for us when we arrived.
The fresh pasta dishes and fresh mozzarella starter were lovely, wine excellent too. With extensive choices on the wine list.
Overall excellent food and professional service.
Would recommend this restaurant"

Great Service,"Good service, and nice environment. The person who served us-Merie is so friendly, thanks for serving us. For the food, I have ordered risotto, it taste too salty to me. The dessert taste good. In sum, good place to chit chat with friends but the food so so."
"Excellent service, average food","Good ambient and good service. Merie has provided an excellent service, she was very friendly and recommended the dessert to us. However the food is not up to our expectations, the Capellini does not really taste good as what mentioned in the Google reviews."
Great service but average food,Merie is a great waitress that provides great service and makes us feel very comfortable. Foodwise is ok. Feel that the cabonara should have more portion and sauce based on the price.
Great food,Cocktail was alright. Dessert were good. Pasta was okay. Pizza was okay but floppy. I have low expectation of western food in Singapore.
