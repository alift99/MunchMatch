Stellar Cantonese cuisine with fault that is so hard to find,"Since its recent reopening in Fairmont, I have already been here no fewer than four times. The standard is exactly the same as before. Star dishes, amongst numerous fantastic offerings, are the Peking duck, drunken prawns, steamed fish, steamed chicken soup in coconut. Service is also very attentive,.

This remains within my top five cantonese restaurant recommendations in Singapore. It is almost always full whether weekday or weekend, so it is wise to make a reservation."
Extremely Over price restaurant and low quality of food for the reopening,"The reopening of this restaurant does not live up to the name as used as used to be.

The standard of the dishes has drop. It believe the hawker Zhi cha can do better.
The prices of all dishes is extremely over price. Ok to pay more but this standard cannot qualify the pricing.
Service is slow.

Don't recommend ."
Fantastic,"It's my family frequent restaurant before COVID, it's good to be back again and they are still maintaining high standard on their food! Love it."
Quality Lunch,"On a Sunday afternoon we decided to have a quality lunch. The restaurant was popular with families for their Tim sum and specials on offer. We chose 3 dishes of tim sum which tasted good. From their Har Kow, pan fried carrot cake and shrimp with bean curd skin was deliciously good. We ordered their sharks fin soup on a hot stone, and braised abalone. It’s quality food and tasted awesome. They had a promotion for $38/bowl and $48/ abalone respectively. For dessert their Ornee (yam paste with ginkgo Nuts) is nice. They have an extensive menu. Service was prompt and friendly."
Visit to Asia Grand Restaurant,Food and service was great! Dim sum freshly made. Ambience is nice. Will bring my family and friends when SMMs are lifted.
Authentic delicious Cantonese cuisine,"I have been here on several occasions; even an Indian friend of mine who doesn’t quite like Chinese food - likes the food here.

This evening I made a few interesting discoveries.

Firstly they do serve dishes that are not inside the menu. The Captain recommended Claypot liver - and it was excellently done! He said this is not always available hence it isn’t in the menu.

Secondly, the other dish that is not present in the menu but you could request for is baked prawns with white pepper. Simply heavenly.

And that’s all I’ll write. Because everything is as good as as usual.

Obviously, we will continue to patronise :-)"
Fantastic HK cantonese fare with warm attentive service,"Had dim sum lunch with my family recently and the food was great as always. Peking duck and bamboo clams were excellent; consistent dim sum nibbles. Staff was attentive and warm, very delightful experience for my parents who have been kept at home. They happy most important. Good crowd and restaurant has set high standards and professionalism even in a trying covid situation. Safe distancing measures and covid protocols were observed and hygiene well practiced. Thank You."
Good quality food and services!,"Love their service staff and their food. Special shout-out to Mr. Peter Chow, he always recommends good and yummy dishes for the family. My child is very picky, but she managed to finished her big bowl of rice just with their daily doubled boiled soup!!!!!!"
Food not good,"no standard at all , all the food, except maybe for the roast duck. Disappointing. Worse than Crystal jade."
Great food. Been a long time,Great food. Been a long time customer. Steamed fish done properly and tasteful. Service was excellent too.
Will not be back definitely for sure ... Period.,"I was doing work- & staycation at Fairmont so wanted to come here for dimsum lunch based on good reviews.

Booked 1 week in advance on 21st Aug via their website and received email confirmation. Upon arrival on 28th Aug, my name was not on their list, and showed them my email confirmation. They assigned a lousy table besides the fish tanks near the kitchen. No apologies given, except the lady in charge of the entrance asked for my contact so she could check if they had wrongly listed me on other day, but never came back. In better restaurant, I would have gotten some sort of complimentary drinks/appetisers, guess this is not 5-star service but price is definitely not worth their service.

We did not wait long for the dimsum, overall taste so-so. Teochew dumpling night wok hey taste. Do not order the hot & sour soup, extremely disappointing. At last the Fried Taro saved the day, and they are currently extending 20% discount except for promotional items."
Sumptuous Dinner,Very good food and good service. We went for the package which comes with the suckling pig and roast goose and abalone. The price was on the higher end but it was a delicious dinner.
"Good food, would be back to try Dim Sum","CNY 8-person set menu was reasonably priced and I love most is the peking duck. However dish interval was abit long, could be better if we did not have to wait for quite awhile for some dishes to arrive on table."
Fabulous Food,"Their Tim sum varieties is quite unique. You get pig stomach soup, Peking duck, suckling pig and push cart with Tim Sum going around."
Another decent dim sum lunch at Asia Grand,I came back here for another decent dim sum lunch experience in August with a friend. No need for a reservation and the usual good quality selection of dim sum available. One of the better dim sum choices in the vicinity.
Comfy Place to Have Dinner,"My siblings decided to treat my wife and I to this place. I found it quite nice and comfy in a private room. There were seven of us and they decided to give us a room. Overall, it was a comfortable place, nicely spaced tables if you are on the outside.
Service wise was very attentive and impeccable.
Food wise, the Suckling Pig was very well done, Everybody liked it. The Roasted Chicken was also nice, however, I found it a bit dry, but the rest of my family liked it.
Hor Fun was very nice and it was my wife's fav dish. It had a generous amount of large prawns, squid and scallops. I did not touch the Yam as I did not take a liking to it, and again, the rest of them enjoyed it very much.
Can't remember which type of veggie but it was ok to me. Finally, a huge plate of prawns with salted egg, very yummy too.
Was told they serve Dim Sum too for lunch, so, we will try at some point in time.
They had free wifi, but, need to ask for password. But, we did not bother."
Stylish and first class,"Was asked to be there by friends. Was greeted by a very nice Manager in a suit who escorted us to our friends because we were late. Once we settled in the dim Sum started and it was excellent. Service was good, food tasty and drinks fresh."
Elegant traditional Chinese cuisine with great service,"You have the feeling you are in one of the elegant and traditional restaurants in Hong Kong. Service is caring and personalised. The owners after so many years are receiving guests with their best skills and the food is simply great: A variety of Chinese cuisines, from the roasted cantonese meat platters, to the roasted duck from Beijing and several seafood delicacies. A great restaurant for an evening dinner."
Very professional and delicious,"We were invited by Singaporeans to this restaurant for lunch. Greeted at the door and escorted to our table by a very nice manager in a suit, it soon became obvious that we were on for a treat. Excellent service then the Dim Sum. Each dish tasted like it had been made just for us. I had an excellent Cabernet and the food just kept coming: assorted dumplings, noodles etc. Suddenly the table went quiet......everyone concentrated on the food. I should have written down what we were eating but the gathering, the atmosphere and all of these dishes ....well I can't remember. This is yet another restaurant that I would definitely return to."
Decent dim sum,I came back here for lunch recently with some colleagues and ex colleagues. 4 of us for around $100 with a good selection of dim sum chosen from the menu. Quality was good and the service efficient.
excellent evening at the restaurant,"very nice discovery for this dinner, the dishes were beautiful, the service of cutting the duck a real show! The exquisite flavors, for broth too, l had never tested this in Europe! Thanks thanks for the invitation of our guest!"
Good and Friendly Service,"I have heard so much about this place from relatives and friends and reading reviews and finally visited this restaurant on 4 May 2019 to celebrate my brother's birthday.

There were a total of 10 adults, 3 active young children and 1 toddler, and the restaurant was able to arrange a table to fit all of us.

The restaurant is located a stone throw away from the City Hall MRT station, behind Carlton Hotel.

The service team was very friendly, patient and accommodating to all our needs and requests and serving of our orders were swift and efficient. Kudos to them to maintaining good service standards despite the restaurant serving at its max.

The quality of the dim sum were above average and the price range was reasonable. The only disappointment was their dessert. I ordered the yam paste which was savory than sweet - I am not sure if this is done to a specific dialect group's specification but I was looking forward to the sweet version.

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant as an option to visit for dim sum. The restaurant is very popular and very crowded, hence, if you want to dine here, I would highly suggest that you make a table reservation to avoid disappointment."
Great place for dimsum,"Great selection of dimsum varieties, fair prices and efficient services. Suggest you make reservation as they looked busy and likely a long wait if you're walking. They are pretty strict with timing also and will be ushered out so the next seating can come in.
Will be back .."
Sum Yum Dim Sum,It's been a while since we have indulged Dim Sum but we were hosted here today for lunch which proved a very special treat. Great food from the get go - no dish was a disappointment and the sauces complemented each non dumpling dish. The service was attentive even when the last lunch surge arrived and the families piled in. Book ahead - its a popular spot.
Fantastic Chinese restaurant,"Nice and top notch atmosphere. Good duck, bass and chicken legs dishes. Recommend for family brunch or dim sum time with friends, excelsior customer service. Clean and great customer service."
Totally satisfying !!!,"My 1st time and I am totally smitten by the food & service. Most amazing and Must try : chicken soup in coconut, stuffed scallop with seafood & truffle. The chicken soup has the sweetness of coconut which gives the soup a refreshing nutritious taste. One bite into the Stuffed scallops and you will screaming JOY.. it was full of flavour, creamy, and great taste. My favourite!!
Adding on to the gastronomic experience is the outstanding service by the staff who were so attentive, alert, friendly who tops up drinks without asking, prompt response and yet knows how to gives private time to diners without intruding. Special mention to Alan & Mee Ling !
Definitely coming back for more !!"
Cheater,"I ordered a Peking Duck and the waitrese suggested to have the duck skin served with the pan cakes and the rest can be served with noodle. When the noodles was served, the portion is rather small and I asked if they are really sure this is with a whole duck. Surprise, surprise, the answer is they are only using part of the duck breast for the noodle and the rest are ""thrown away"". On the menu and on the bill - i am paying for a duck, not just the skin and part of breast.

They also argued they are doing an ""offer"" with the duck which used to be much more expensive. I really don't understand the logic but I guess they are implying they are marking down the price for a reason.

Food is average but this kind of dirty trick is really bad."
Nice cantonese cuisine,Our group enjoyed our dinner. Service staff was polite and the quality of food is good. They have private rooms for special functions which is quire rare in the CBD area.
Your best bet for good Chinese food in this area,"I have been here on several occasions with friends, family and business associates.

Consistently good Cantonese food here, lunch or dinner. If ordering ala carte, go for bamboo clams, Peking duck, flambé prawns, pipa bean curd, steamed fish. Even my Indian friend likes the food here (she is quite picky with Chinese food). Desserts are pretty common stuff, though, but excellently done. Service is attentive and efficient without being obtrusive.

Around this area (Raffles hotel, raffles city, bras basah), this Chinese restaurant is a clear winner. Wah Lok from nearby Carlton And Kai garden in marina square would each be a close second to this."
So so,Dim sum was average. Peking duck was very normal. Service initially was good thereafter mediocre. After finishing all the dim sum. Waited for half an hour before being served the balance of the duck despite 3 reminders. Plenty of staff acting busy and they acknowledged ur request without actually relaying the orders. Only when I asked for the bill and tell them forget about the duck did they actually responded to serving the balance of the peking duck
Great service and good food,This is my family’s go to place for dim sum and also for our reunion dinner for the past 4 years. Food is good and coupled with great service! Highly recommended!
Chinese Cantonese Cuisine,Very good dim-sum. This is a good restaurant for larger parties. There are private dining rooms available.
Yummy Dim Sum,Dim sums were generally good except that the xiao long bao was an okay item to miss. The bite size egg tarts just leaving you wanting for more.
Tim Sum,"I finally had an opportunity to try out the restaurant as I was looking to entertain our foreign guests living nearby.
We decided to try out the Tim Sum as the restaurant specially opens early every Sunday at 10am.
The place was cosy and atmosphere was good.
The food was good especially the roasted pork. The service was good and prompt. We like it and enjoyed very much the Tim Sum."
Good meal experience,"We enjoyed our meal in a cosy private room. The Suckling pig was deliciously well balanced and meaty. The broccoli with abalone was delicate and just right. The soup with bamboo strips was edible as was their fried tofu, Their fried soft shell crab was very oily with a thick batter; the noodles with seafood and XO sauce was disappointing. The dessert included a fruit platter and a mango sago pamelo which was too sweet for me. Be prepared to pay."
Peking duck and Roast Pork,"i ordered the whole peking duck and roasted pork here along with other dim sum which i will say very hawker centre taste, not much to brag for .

Main highlights is always the peking duck and roasted pork, its a must try , amazing crispy skin but yet nice soft meat inside, well done for that . will def come back for this two item .

There’s a promo currently that is $40/- for one whole duck, i think that’s quite a steal. Reservation is required for weekend."
Worth a visit,"Restaurant pretty crowded for lunch so food must be good..

Tip top service ..6 captains looking after customers needs

Indeed the dim sum was above average in taste... I like the ham swee kok best... also the dried shrimp chilli was simply nice to go with the dim sum."
Yummy dim sum lunch!!,"Decided last minute to come for a birthday lunch on a Saturday and forgot to book in advance. When we arrived at 1130am (its opening time), there was already a lot of people waiting outside. Super lucky to get a table although we only have 1.5hour due to not booking in advance.

Fabulous service and good dim sum! My sister in law said she was cold and the server immediately took a shawl for her.

Seafood porridge - only available during weekend- really good
Garlic pork - yummy
Standard dim sum dishes - all very good
The only dish I would skip if I go again is the lotus leaf chicken rice
Beef stomach - tasty and chewy
Dumpling soup bowl - one of the tastiest I had

Had a good lunch and will definitely go back again!"
Lovely Dim Sum 😋,"Been to lots of places for dim sum, this place definitely scores for both its cuisine and setting. It may not appeal to some but it definitely gives me a sense of nostalgia.

It is advisable to make your reservation as weekends tends to get a little more crowded, especially if it is the school holiday period!

As I’m a foodie and my parents call me a glutton so everything’s looks appetising to me. You may like to refer to my pictures and make your decision. Enjoy!"
Old school cantonese,"We have been here a few times for its fabulous old school dim sums, Chinese New Year meals and birthday meals.

There's a bit of an 80s vibe to the food and the service in this restaurant.

When we last visited, we ordered a couple of simple dishes as there was only me and my husband. We had the crispy roast chicken (yummy but a little salty), salted fish fried rice (super yummy), stir fried spinach (delicious) and foie gras cheese scallops (well, we might not order this again - 4 pieces was simply too much and rich for just 2 of us).

We love the attentive and efficient service. Great place for a nice meal with friends and family."
Authentic and excellent,Our second visit to this incredible restaurant! We ensured we had a booking long before traveling to Singapore on this trip. My absolute favourite the chicken feet - and I hate offal! The Peking Duck is excellent and ask them to turn the leftovers into a fried rice. Dumplings are excellent too. It fills up quickly at lunch time so make sure you book beforehand.
Lovely Restaurant for Dim Sum,"Went for a Dim Sum lunch with the family & we ordered a huge variety to share among ourselves. I particularly liked the Steamed Cheong Fun with Shrimp/ Scallop, Carrot Cake, Lean Meat Porridge with Preserved Egg & the Baker Custard Bun. I would say it is one of the best place to go for nice Dim Sum with a decent atmosphere in Singapore. We celebrated my brother’s birthday in the restaurant too and the servers happily joined in with us, they are certainly quite friendly as they helped us out in the surprising element for the celebration."
Fantastic food and stellar service,"It was the first time my fiancee and I were at Asia Grand, with both of us impressed. We enjoyed all the dishes, including the soft shell crab and the special fried rice. The servers were all prompt and friendly, with one stationed just to direct us where the nearest toilet was. This was the perfect venue for our association's dinner as well."
One of the Best dim sum in Singapore.,"If you want to find out what's tasty dim sum should taste like, you should try Asia Grand! This restaurant serves authentic mouth-watering Cantonese dim sum! The place can be crowded though, so best to make a reservation if you plan to go. They have rooms that can be divided to accommodate comfortably for family gathering. Apart from the usual dim sum, their suckling roast piglet and peking roast duck are great too. After you're served with the crispy skin of the piglet and roast duck, you can request the server to have the remaining meat cooked in the way you want. Usually I would have them stir fry with scallions and ginger. Also, if you like lobster and other seafood, they do serve them as well(but kind of pricy for seafood). Just take the MRT to City Hall station and walk for about 6 mins to the restaurant!"
Great Dim Sum Restaurant,"I decided to check out this restaurant since it’s 5 min walk from the hotel. If you’re into Dim Sum then this is one of the best restaurants in Singapore. The staff are very attentive and friendly. The food was served quite quickly. I ordered several dishes including roast duck, noodle and Dim Sum and all was delicious. Highly recommended."
Wonderful find with friends,"We had a great dinner with winter melon soup , Peking duck and baked crab etc. The food was very good and service was very fast & attentive. Would return to bring my parents here."
One of our favourite dim sum restaurant.,"Other than Summer Pavilion Restaurant at The Ritz, this is the next fav restaurant for dim sum.
I love their Peking duck,(a steal at $40 & u pay $15 to cook the duck meat for another dish). All dim sum dishes are nice here. We are spoilt for choice. I am drooling now. Reservation for weekend is a must."
Great Dim Sum,"My family was recommended to this restaurant by a very friendly Uber driver. We arrived early without a reservation on a Monday mid-morning. We were ushered in as soon the restaurant opened. The selection of dim sum here was reasonable because they expected guests to order other food too. As we already ate but going there, we limited our order to dim sum only. Boy! Are we in for a surprise. The food was delicious and the servings were generous. The service was impeccable. There was no need for us to tell the service personnel to refill our tea cups. We greatly enjoyed our brunch there. Will definitely go there to try their Peking Duck."
Dim sum lunch,"Was recommended by the locals that this was the place to select to enjoy a traditional dim sum lunch. Food and service was excellent - however the choices were to our surprise somewhat restricted compared to our expectations. As a party of six, the restaurant ensured that all selections were in multiples of six and all dishes were served piping hot and in a timely manner. All in all, an excellent choice in first class surroundings."
Great dim sum but small selection,Came here for lunch and loved the dim sum we ordered. We wished there was a wider selection though - half the reason for dim sum is soup dumplings! No soup dumplings :( but everything we ate was awesome.
Great quality,"Great food quality comes at a cost! We had peking duck, winter melon soup, sucking pig, sliced beef steaks, and red bean paste cakes. Location easy to find, just across from Chijmes or Raffles City."
Always consistent and good,Had Dim Sum lunch. Good selection. We were a party of 5 and the restaurant portion out the dishes in the appropriate proportion for 5. No overeating or someone being left out. Very considerate. Make sure you book as it is very popular
Not as expected,My husband and I chose this restaurant because we wanted a Dim Sum lunch and the restaurant was handy to our hotel. The food was nice and of good quality and the service very good but we were rather disappointed in the Dim Sum menu selection. My husband does not eat meat but does eat seafood so usually we can find a large range of Dim Sum dishes which we can share. However my husband had very little choice at this restaurant with even the prawn dumplings having mince meat with the shrimp. We will try another Dim Sum place next time.
A sequence of delicious dishes,"Our group, meeting in Singapore, was invited by the local authorities for a welcome dinner, and it was a smashing success. The meal started with prawns, pancakes with Peking Duck, mushrooms, soup and the highlight was suckling pig. The service was swift, and there was a great ambiance around the round tables. Wine, beer and tea were on offer."
Very good dim sum and peking duck,"I ate there yesterday and had to go back again today I enjoyed it so much. Right next to the Carlton hotel and a block from Raffle City mall, so very convenient since I was staying at the Carlton (from Seattle). This is a very popular place on Saturday and Sunday mornings for families. I think I was the only non-Chinese person there. The staff was very friendly. Prices were also quite reasonable. Highly recommend."
What a find!,"We stumbled upon this treasure among the plethora of options in singapore one night whilst strolling the streets looking for a decent meal that didn't cost the earth. We returned two more times during our weeklong stay. This evening we had the magnificent 2 course Peking duck experience which did not disappoint. Service is exceptional and the food, enjoyed by mostly only locals is a high end setting without the high end price tag. Superb."
Once again excellent,"This is an excellent choice in terms of service, food, atmosphere and pricing. Can not ask for anymore."
Good Chinese dish,Our lunch here at a local Chinese restaurant was quite impressive. While the place was quite busy and noisy the food here was quite good and frankly beat our low expectation. Food is tasty in Chinese tradition way. Soup was mild but fresh.
Excellent food,"Asia Grand has many excellent options, best served as a variety of dishes and shared. Large tables available to accommodate big groups as well."
Simply Sumptuous,"My sister arranged annual birthday dinner for our mother, a family affair that took up 3 tables plus. Started off with lotus paste buns, OK. Then the good stuff, roast piglet, doubled-boiled soup, fish done in fried and stir-fry, garlic garnished prawns, roast chicken followed by vegetable dish, fried noodles (all appropriate for a sumptuous Cantonese Dinner.)
On top of that, excellent service whereby plates were changed after appropriate dish.
Rounding off with freshly cut fruits and pancake delight. All in all, a great feast of a celebratory meal."
Not bad but pricey dim sum,"I went there for dim sum as always heard that it is really good. I ordered siew mai(not bad), fried glutinous rice(average), xiao long bao(nice, somehow i feel better and bigger than dim tai fung), roasted park(average but have crispy skin) and deep fried intestine(taste ok but i can't appreciate it). The other good part is the shrimp chili, that is really nice, we had 2 sauce plate.

Overall dim sum is good but pricey too. I saw a lot of people ordered peking duck so i guess duck dishes also the signature."
Amazing Asia Grand!,"Decided to have a meal here after some research on restaurants which serve Peking Duck. We entered apprehensively as it looked ""upmarket"" and big dollar signs swirled in my head.
We need not have worried. We were made to feel very welcome by the professional and attentive staff.
The special of the evening was a whole Peking Duck for $S40. How good was that? Needless to say we ordered that plus some BBQ pork belly and mixed green vegetables. All were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. In fact we ordered way too much for 2 people and unfortunately left a lot of duck meat. We couldn't even take it with us because we were leaving the next day.
This restaurant was packed with locals which is a very good sign.
Highly recommended."
Very good and authentic Chinese food,I had lunch with a bunch of colleagues at Asia Grand. We had dim sum and steamed fish. All of which was excellent. The service is fuss-free but efficient.
wonderful wonderful wonderful,"never mind the reasonably priced, delicious, yummy food! the service was superb...SUPERB! everyone was eager to serve with a smile! especially impressed when my empty glass was filled up within 30secs! definitely looking for opportunities to be back again!"
Dim sum lunch - arrive after 1130am,"Portions are quite large (ie u get 6 pieces of egg tarts, baked puffs). The best for me was the Siew mai. As we arrived at 10am, the appetizer selection were still not available. So we only had limited order. Place was quite busy though.

Advise is: book a table.. arrive after 1130 hours"
Highly recommended place for Tim Sum,"Restaurant is conveniently located, walking distance from City Hall mrt.

Had a great Tim Sum lunch with my Parents , Uncle and Cousin. We really enjoyed all dishes especially the pork knuckles in vinegar, and chicken feet! The Peking duck is delicious and value for money.

Service is excellent too! Would recommend to visit this restaurant."
"Amazing Peking Duck, amazing value","This friendly Chinese Restaurant offers a truly wonderful Peking Duck, sliced and prepared at your table. The seafood is also fresh and delicious and the vegetables are crisp and tasty. The bill was a pleasant surprise too, really good value and highly recommended."
Very Delicious Food,We were invited here for a birthday celebration. The food was delicious. The service great. The sucking pig was very well done. Good place to hold a celebration.
We had so much to eat !,"Took some time to decide what to eat cos there's so much to choose from in the menu! There were 4 of us and we ordered steamed bamboo clams, crab with egg white, yam ring, claypot rice, roast chicken, spinach & fish skin with egg yolk. Plus 2 types of soup - the chicken with black fungus and rice wine and winter melon seafood soup. The food is of good quality and the service is great! Total $356 for 4 of us and we really 'stuffed our faces' with so much food! We had to give dessert a miss"
A predictably good Chinese restaurant,"Asia Grand have been one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in Singapore and I reckon it is for many too: Food is consistently good and reasonably priced with service always attentive including from the owner and his senior managers. Many of their staff have been with them for years; which says a lot for how the restaurant is managed and run.
Their Chinese food is predominantly Cantonese probably because of the owner and executive chef’s Hong Kong heritage. They are quite famous and very popular for their lunchtime dim sum.
I always go there as default family or business meals, and always order their lup mei fun: rice slow-cooked with preserved meats such as Chinese sausages, liver rolls, waxed duck and vegetables in a clay pot. They use very high quality ingredients and there is a huge serving of choy sum vegetables for balance. Even the smallest portion is a meal in itself; ample for two to three persons. The sauce they pour over the dish is very delicious; like the icing on the cake. When you finished eating, you can ask them to use the scrappings of the burnt rice on the pot to cook with stock for a soup to round off the meal.
They are also well known for their roast pork, Peking duck, steamed chicken with ham and all manners of fresh seafood (yes, they have several tanks of them). For the vegetarian, they would recommend their bean curd with spinach and enoki mushrooms. I also love their stir-fried vegetables of sweet peas, lily bulbs and cashew nuts; something you can pick on as the meal progresses.
They are one of the older Chinese restaurants in Singapore; having started in the defunct Asia Hotel along Scotts Road (next to Sheraton Towers) and remained very popular for family occasions, dining with clients or just a simple but very good Chinese meal!
They are conveniently located at the ground floor of Odeon Towers (across from the rear of Raffles Hotel or diagonally from Raffles City) with ample car parking space. Reservations are encouraged."
Excellent service and dim sum,"We were the last customers at lunch time, but they were very friendly. Dim sum were perfect. I would come back!"
Make your reservations !,One of the best restaurants around. Do make your reservations to avoid disappointment. We went for their dim sum and had a wonderful meal.
for a few dumplings more,"Asia Grand is an excellent joint for dim sum with very attentive service in an agreeable if somewhat unexciting environment. There are plenty of tables nicely spread out in the dining room, which is clearly popular with Singaporeans. The main menu covers a la carte dishes whilst the dumplings are ordered off a separate paper list (in English as well as in characters). The choice is somewhat carnivorous (lots of pork) and, regrettably, there is one offering with shark's fin soup but there are sufficient other dishes for pescatarians like me. The pastry is delicate, and the fillings generous and tasty and, if you want some greens, the kai lan is excellent. The shrimp cheong-fun is good but the sauce with the fresh scallop version works less well (too strong/sweet for my taste). The imported Tsing-Tao is ice cold, the tea very acceptable and the prices reasonable. Once your order is in the dishes come thick and fast so you may prefer to request your dim sum on a 'rolling basis'."
Excellent Dim Sum,"Came here umpteen times with family or colleagues for dim sum. Pricing is very reasonable and location is near City Hall and Bugis. Peking duck is highly recommended in which serving starts around 11am only.
All in all worth to make a trip down and try to make reservation in order not to wait too long for a seat."
Great Cantonese dinner,"Great Cantonese dinner with family and friends! The restaurant is packed we had to wait for 30 minutes for the table but the waiting time worth to try. Good food and impeccable service. I don't know the price because my friend ordered and also payed the bill

Definitely to try"
Top Cantonese restaurant for suckling pig,"Haven't had the Cantonese suckling pig at Asia Grand for nearly a year. Ordered one to share with family and friends for lunch and it remained as tasty as before.

The size of pig used was the right size to ensure maximum crispiness of the skin while the meat remained tender during the roasting process. Also the fatty layer beneath the skin was reduced.

The end result was thin and crispy pieces of suckling pig skin to accompany sprigs of spring onion and dollops of thick sweet sauce on steamed bite-sized pieces of circular flat breads. The chopped pieces of meat were juicy and tender to bite.

Asia Grand remains on my list of top Cantonese restaurants to enjoy roasted suckling pig in Singapore."
"Good food, interesting dishes","We have been with some friends/collegues recently to this place, we went there for lunch and we had a 10-course menu, among which typical Yee Sang Chinese New Year salad, abalone, scallop gratin, suckling pig, etc. The service was good and the restaurant is in a convenient location. Overall pretty good!"
Exceptional sweet and sour pork,"We accidentally found this restaurant close to our hotel and arrived quite late in the evening before closing time. We quickly chose a couple of dishes of which the sweet and sour pork was exceptional. I don't even recall ordering this dish as it often is prepared in a rather bland way. But this this was full of flavours and had great texture. I would like to come again and taste other dishes, too."
Very prompt service n good food!,"Hey, this place served up the dim sum within 10mins of placing the order! And it was a busy lunch hour on Christmas Day!

Impressive service. And they were running a promotion on Peking Duck (@$40/-). Good deal. The duck skin was wrapped and served on the table mid way thru the dim sum. Great!

Most dishes are good, and they have my fav 咸水角 (which they call ""delicious dumpling""!). Yummy!

Couple disappointing dishes, which I would skip next time: 小笼包 (dry, no soup), egg tarts (tasteless and the crust is flaky but oily).

Best dishes: steamed rice (盅仔饭), yam dumpling (芋角）and steamed pork ribs.

Overall, above average dim sum, like tong lok, and other hotel's Chinese restaurants (wan ting, tien court).

Price-wise, like most singapore nice dim sum, about $30 per head."
Acceptable dim sum,Came here for dim sum lunch this week with some colleagues. Generally ok selection of dim sum and reasonable service. Not too busy in the week before Christmas so no reservation was needed. Paid $85 for 4 people but wasn't quite enough for me.
Authentic Chinese Cuisine with a Diverse Menu,"If you want to find a not too crowded place, right within the city area (esp. if you're near Raffles Hotel or City Hall area) for some quality Chinese food, Asia Grand is the place to be, where I especially like it for -

(1) A good spread of Chinese food - ranging from the roast meat section, Peking Duck, various types of soup, poultry, vegetables, seafood (Think Chilli Crab etc.)

Best Dim Sum in Singapore,Everytime I travel to Singapore Asia Grand is a must for me. Make sure you don't go after 1pm because they can run out of certain types of dim sum. You will love the Peking duck or suckling pig. Those are always a must. Make sure you try this place its a hidden gem in the city. Its located right behind the Raffles Hotel.
excellent restaurant,"the restaurant has been around, with some of the older staff for a long time since its days at scotts road. the new location has better dining facilities. the old location was eventually rebuilt with a new apartment, hamilton scotts. had dined there for more than 15 years, never for once we were disappointed with the food or service. too bad this time around they didn't make it to the michelin books. They deserve better recognition in singapore. serves cantonese dishes and dim sum."
Worth trying the dim sum,"Attracted to this restaurant because of the Peking duck. I think this is one of the cheapest we can find in town (S$40). However, I think our duck was ""over roasted"", the skin was rather dry. But the ee fu noodles fried with the duck meat was nice.
The dim sum that we tried were generally good too. Service was prompt, restaurant is spacious. Nice place for a family gathering."
The place for Chinese food,"We were invited by a colleague of mine from our Singapore Office. Accordingly this visit was well planed and one of the hot spots for chines food in Singapore. The restaurant was predominately visit by locals (what a contrast to the Raffels). The Peking Dug was just great and very special. Great place if you want to test a broad variety of Chinese food...we had 8 (!) courses.....each to share, which is recommendable. Excellent food..we would come back..."
Asia (perhaps) grand,"We had struggled to find a place on a busy night, so the hotel concierge said try Asia Grand. He described it as Cantonese without fancy white tablecloths. This seemed to resonate with our needs. We had actually walked past it approx 2 hours earlier and were put off by the yellow curtains which seemed to be very unwelcoming. Why the privacy?

Once inside, it looked better than we had expected, fears allayed.

We ordered several dishes and our trepidation grew when the first 2 meals arrived, as both were not to our taste. Mistake - do not order off the daily special listing or chef's recommendations.

After the bad start, we were much happier. Very good diced beef in black pepper, lovely snow peas served with cashew nuts and a very tasty seafood fried rice.

Asia Grand satisfied our needs. Had we stopped after the first 2 courses, who knows?."
Love the Peking Duck,"This is one of my favourite placed for chinese cuisine in Singapore.
The Peking Duck is a must: very tasty and crunchy duck skin rolled into a soft wrap, all dipped into a very tasty sauce.
I also love the Suckling Pig and the selection of dessert."
"Horribly Expensive, BUT extremely GOOD quality food","As you mouth opens wide when the food comes, and your eyes pop out at the tasty dishes start coming to your table, so will your eyes and mouth open wide like a goldfish when the bill comes. But I guess it is the price you pay for (excellent) service, and (top) quality food. You cannot go wrong here. The crowd here is terribly large, so reservations are much recommended. But if you do not have cold hard cash, do have at least 3 credit cards. haha!"
Decent food and a below-average experience,"We had dinner with friends, a total of 8 adults and 4 teenagers. We ordered a set menu for 10, that was priced at $468++. After we ordered, they came back to tell us that they cannot offer one of the dishes with live prawns as they had run out of live prawns. So their alternative was 'normal' prawns and they can make a salted egg yolks prawn or wasabi prawn. We asked if we can have beef instead, but they came back saying it cannot be done. (Not happy!) We are stuck with their 'normal' prawns, from which we chose the salted egg yolks prawn. The prawns were soggy, and very disappointing.

I feel that they should have the flexibility of offering more alternatives when they run out of produce. Why should we be given inferior produce?"
Delicious Tim Sum at Asia Grand,Delicious Tim Sum at Asia Grand where they formerly from the old Asia Hotel. Price has gone up but still reasonable
Old school,"Fret not, if you're looking for an old school Cantonese dim sum. While the interiors are pedestrian, the food is worth shouting about. Wide selection of traditional favourites to choose from. I highly recommend the rolls of prawn and mango. The lotus leaf glutinous rice was decadently moist and bursting with the flavours of scallops."
Traditional Chinese,"This is a big restaurant and it is full with local regulars.

We have been invited here by a very good friend and enjoyed the Chinese hospitality. The Peking Duck is carved at the table and the meat in the noodles at the end of the meal was as delicious as the Peking Duck

There is plenty of fresh seafood, lobsters and fish, all kept in tanks at the one side of the restaurant

Here they serve as well more exotic dishes like shark fin soup, not everyone's taste I am sure but something I think is important to mention

Service is excellent and always there when needed

The flavor of the food is very good, no doubts, but we did have better in Singapore, that's why it is only 4 stars and not 5 stars...."
Value for money Peking Duck,"The peking duck @$38 is delicious and value for the money, you may also add $10 to cook the remainder of the duck for another dishes. Majority of the dimsum at this venue is tasty and worth a visit if you have tried before.

I must comment that the service is very attentive and the servers will change your plates when needed."
"Great dim sum, diligent service","We very much enjoyed our lunch, the service was extremely diligent, an empty water glass verged on impossible. The food was quick and extremely tasty, the steamed custard buns for dessert were mouth watering pinnacles of the meal.
Trying to find a way to get back as the pieking duck being served to other tables looked amazing."
Yum cha..,Simply love to yum cha at this restaurant. . Reasonable pricing for quality dim sum.. must try the peking duck for $38... Service is also good...
CNY lunch,Food and service were awesome. Staff was attentive. I like the Yu Sheng very much but didn't really appreciate the shark fin soup cause I feel too much egg rolls. Overall was great .
Great dim sum and peking duck,"We were here for their famous lunch dim sum. Ordered most of the items. Except for egg tarts, chicken feets and pork ribs dim sum, the rest of the dim sums are consider above average. Peking duck is a must order dish. Service standard is definitely above average. I will recommend a return visit to this restaurant."
One of my favorite chinese restaurant in singapore,Asia grand must be one of my favorite chinese Restuarant in singapore. It is owned by 3 brothers that had migrated to singapore many years back. The Cantonese food is very fine and yummy and it doesn't cost you an arm and leg like some others restaurant.
Awesome food and service.,"Was craving for good Chinese food and came here on a whim.

The Good:

1. Excellent service. The staff was super attentive and courteous and we didn't have to wait at all to get their attention for ordering, changing our order, obtaining their recommendation or having our tea refilled. Plus, a super warm welcome at the door. I found it particularly heartening to note that they had some senior staff working here, who've probably been around with the organisation for a good number of years. I suppose the quality they bring to service is markedly different from most other restaurants where you find young undergrad or poly students etc with no training or experience in the service sector.

2. Big broad menu.

3. Great food quality and 'china'- no pun intended!

4. Open till a bit later than most other places.

The Not-so-good:

I found the seating arrangement, with its big round tables spread all over the place as somewhat unwelcoming and suitable mostly for family and large groups. We visited as a couple and found there were no quiet 2-seated corners or nooks or smaller tables for couples or smaller groups. This is something the management may want to look into."
Number 1,"The service at this restaurant was amazing. The food, possibly the best Chinese food I have had in years. The Peking duck- 10/10."
