Must try!!,"We had the most incredible dinner at amo for my birthday. Everything was cooked to perfection - we tried pizza, pasta, roast chicken, truffle mash and tiramisu. I could not think of anything this restaurant could improve on.. thanks team!"
Super Amazing Drinks at Amo,Love the drinks concocted by Mandip Singh at the bar. Never did like whiskey but he mixed something to it and voilà! It was refreshing and had an aftertaste of whiskey which was much appreciated. Another drink worthy of mention is his version of tequila shot with a few elements including a dash of Tabasco sauce! His drinks made us want to try more exotic drinks and am already looking forward to my next visit to the restaurant in December!
"Great food, gret ambience, great aervice","Came here for lunch and was surprised by how good the food really is. Personally, I find it better than iO. Service is fantastic, engaging and non-intrusive."
Impeccable service & great food,This is my second time here . Must order their mains and pizza . Staff were friendly and service was superb
Recommended,Tried some Italian foods for our anniversary and not disappointed at all :) The food was great and people were so nice as well. Will call for delivery whenever craving for.
Excellent food and service,Visited Amo to enjoy their value-for-money set lunch and it was delicious! Service was impeccable and nice ambience to add. Had the pasta which had a really authentic Italian taste to it. Wonderful and attentive service as well.
Ordering hiccups,"While the food was nice, the staff seemed to be rushing everywhere which the service suffered in turn. They were curt and borderline inhospitable. The server was ready to walk away after taking our food order. We wanted to order drinks ‍♂️

Another incident that stood out was when I placed the order for the pumpkin pizza. The staff then put in the order for a non-vegetarian pizza and when I mentioned about it, he said “there’s pumpkin in the pancetta pizza”. If I wanted a pancetta pizza, I would’ve mentioned! If there were more than 1 pizza that had pumpkin in it, they should ask to clarify which one I meant.

So we asked for the right pizza and that took forever to come. That really put us off dessert. Voting with our feet and won’t go back for awhile."
Will come back,First time here . I heard that the food was nice but it turned out better than expectation . Must try their grilled brinjal and spring chicken .
Welcomed Home,"We dined here for lunch on 18/06/22 and the experience was amazing

It was like being welcomed home; with warm personable service the moment we walked in the door
Even though the restaurant was busy, we did not feel rushed, the staff took their time to introduce the menu and recommend their favorites

We ended up going with 2 of their recommendations, the Tuna Tartare with Avocado, Apple and Cucumber & Charred Iberico Pluma, Tomato Hummus, Wild Mugnuli, Chilli Salmoriglio

My wife, normally hesitant of raw tuna, found the flavor combination delightful and it was a beautiful start to the meal.

Our second course was Hand Rolled Trofie Pasta, Purple Artichokes, Apulian Almond Pesto and Peperoncino - while I oft shun vegetarian options, this dish was a delight. They did not skimp on ingredients and every mouthgul was a burst of flavor - I did not want to have the last bite to finish the dish

The main course was cooked to perfection, when we were told that Pluma was a cut from the neck of the pig, we were slightly hesitant; worried that it might be a tough cut to be grilled. Our fears were unwarranted as the meat just melted in our mouth, perfectly seasoned - it did not need any of the decadent Tomato Hummus

We finished off our meal with an Italian cheese plate; Gorgonzola, Fontina, Pecorino served with dried muscats, apricots & prunes

It was an exceptional experience, and is on our top 10 places to eat"
Nice food and kind staff,I spend two time in this place to confirm food quality.Second time was better than first experience and also staff was very kind and efficient. Sure I will go back during my next trip to Singapore.
Amo lunch,Excellent service. Super food ! Lovely place ambience. Must try ! Look for Caroline the manager. Every thing was super. Must try. Their squid ink pasta. Their beef and their desserts.
"Amazing staff, great food","Reservation was made through Chope. Missed out to indicate that we had an infant with us but staff was accommodating and quick to find us a seat spacious enough for the stroller. Food was great and quick to serve even though they were full. We ordered a tuna tartare, which was refreshing and great dish to start the meal, straciatella pizza and a smoked ebikko spaghetti. Straciatella was smooth and paired well with the prosciutto on the pizza. Pasta was umami-filled and had a generous portion of ebikko. Recommended to share the pasta though as can get jelak. Overall a great experience and will be back again!"
One guy ruined the experience,"Food was not bad, until one guy ruined the dining experience by firstly serving wrong order, followed by quickly accusing us of sharing a set menu between 2 pax. Followed by saying he will need to charge an additional main.

He did not bother to check our order (we already ordered additional main and starter on top of the set menu. I had to clarify that they were already served and cleared.) He also had the cheek to say he will charge us a discounted rate for that wrong order he brought out (which I quickly called him back to take it away untouched because I knew it was wrong).

He did not bother to make up for his mistakes, and his lack of attention to a customer’s table orders left behind unpleasant memories.

Classic case of good food, bad service. For a $270 meal, it was not what I expected.

By the way, all the other staff were great, it was only this one senior male Caucasian staff who ruined the dinner."
Proper Italian,"Delicious proper Italian food with a nice wine list to boot. Great service and despite being a bit quiet, late on a Sunday evening had a nice atmosphere"
Set Lunches,"Lunch started with a small mishap as they could not find our reservation, but they were quick to find us a table.

The amuse bouche was a nice start, and was followed by eggplant with burrata and beef shank pasta. The pasta was tasty and was enjoyable. The missus found the eggplant to be a tad light, but still enjoyed the dish.

Mains were Iberico pork and octopus. The pork won hands down, and was delicious. The grilled octopus was okay and was a smallish portion, with a slight hint of chilli.

Dessert was chocolate tart with coffee or tea.

Service was friendly but food pacing was a tad slow, perhaps due to the almost full house for lunch.

Their 4 course set lunch start is $50."
Great experience,"Had a great evening here with my wife. The food and service were excellent - our waiter Kirby basically mapped out our whole evening after we asked for his opinion, and he nailed it. 3 courses and a dessert with no misses. Tuna tartare, smokey pasta, beef special were so fresh, simple, and well prepared. Ambiance was nice although the lighting was sort of bright and direct, possibly just our table. Overall we had a great night and would recommend to friends and family. Thanks again Kirby and team for a great night."
Fantastic Italian cuisine,"Great experience at Amo. Service was great, food arrived quickly.

Went for the tasting menu and can’t say anything but nice things about each course, from the arranccini to the dessert. Everything was full of flavour. The dessert was a total surprise, looked deceptively simple but tasted divine.

Will definitely be coming again to try more items a la carte."
Genuine italian food but lack of service,"Excellent pizza, interesting genuine innovative italian dishes . We like burrata , octopus with pasta. Some plate lack of sauce though Wine price are a bit on high side but we got good pick. Service for the 3rd time we come read lousy . Waiter are clumsy, we are remembered every 10 min to place order including dessert before 9:30 pm . Located in lively HK street , the team give the feeling of lazy people . This is a shame as overall atmosphere is very nice and modern ."
Amazing Restaurant,"Amo was simply amazing. The ambience was great. Each food item on the menu had its own personality. The taste, uniqueness was amazing. I came with a client first and everybody loved it. Later, I saw myself coming back with other clients within 2 days Desserts didn’t impress us as much as the food did. I would definitely go back again to try those calamari’s, lamb chops and the steak"
Food was good,"food was great and ambience was nice. two things I have a problem with is firstly, how small and dirty the toilets are, I dont recommend you using them as they are filthy and smelly and clogged. second thing I have a problem with is that they dont accept cash or nets, when my friend and I were going to pay the guy told us they dont accept cash or nets, and those were the only two options my friend and I had, so I had to call someone to rescue us, but the manager ended up paying for us and taking our cash instead. just do keep in mind they are cashless xx"
value for money,Food is really good and value for money because is fine dinning food. One pizza is enough for 2 pax and i love their grilled octopus
Well Taken Care,"Great service, good food and location. Having said that, Amo could consider serving ketchup with fries ... .."
Review of Amo Restaurant,"My friends and I felt that the food standard has dropped. For e.g., the food when served appears to be pre-prep and not hot."
Awesome dining experience,"Four of us ordered an assortment of salads, mains and pizza for our inaugural visit and were more than thrilled of the pleasant taste from each item. The pizza was clearly a standout. We were attended to regularly and well hosted throughout the evening. My guests were sufficiently impressed that they instantly booked a table for themselves for a second visit. I definitely intend to return, soon."
Food is delicious,"Food is delicious but priced on the higher side. nice place to try out. service is alittle slow, probably due to lack of staff during vday."
Overall a ok experience,"We went there to celebrate a friend’s birthday. Took the outdoor seats reservation. The outdoor needs a much better revamp and outlook to match their indoor interiors.

The food was great. Reccomend the beef and ikura spaghetti. Calamari was not as fresh as expected. The cocktails was great.

The restaurant was really nice to give a complementary tiramisu for my friend’s birthday. Overall a great experience with good service"
AMO Lunch,"Overall 5/5!!! Location 4/5 Environment 5/5 Food 5/5, the aged pork grill is very nice! Service: 5/5 Drinks/ wine : 4.5/5"
Margherita pizza is good,"It’s my first time to try Amo, and I’m impressed with the pizza. We ordered eggplant as appetizer and I can say it’s my favorite antipasti. We also ordered fettucine for our pasta, and I think it needs to be revamped, something is missing"
Average service & food for pricing,Average food for the kind of pricing which was on the expensive side. Service was abrupt and rushed.
Pleasant Experience,"First visit - the atmosphere and service was good! However, it was sad that most of the mains/popular dishes which we wanted to try but they were sold out at dinner time (6:30pm LOL). Love the fried calamari and the handmade pastas! Food might be slightly pricey but overall it was still good. Worth to give it a try!"
Amo restaurant review,"Terrible and rude service experience.
They basically asked us to leave because someone else where going to have our table in witch we had reserved a week in advance. We spend a 200 dollar on the food there which was not worth they money and really overrated. I would not recommend anyone thins restaurant. Such bad and expensive experiences."
Slightly disappointing experience,Food quality has gone a little downhill since our last visit 2 years ago. Hoping it’s a one off. Service was okay though felt abrupt and rushed.
Memorable evening,Excellent service. The service staff gave good recommendations on dishes and wine which turned out to be fabulous
Great food but bit too pricey to draw Qs.,Spent 60-70 each for a fmaily of 5. 4 sparkling waters + 2 beers total. Great flavours but would go back if it was $40. Pizza was v good.
Poor Service and Food,"Very bad service when we went there to celebrate our Christmas Eve. The food was cold when it’s served. The table setting also terrible, we sat at like a garage with a lot of fan and have a small door which is open and we can see the skewer."
Saturday night dine out,"Good food, good ambience. Service is alright, table spacing is alright too. Not sure why restaurant is abit noisy. It gets a little chaotic when 1st seatings leave. Maybe sitting outdoor ia better?"
"Good food, bad service","Service staff was super rude. The tone used by the Asian guy was condescending & rude when we asked questions regarding the menu. At the end of the meal, the Filipino lady passed the check to her colleagues to check but didn’t want to let us check the receipt. Just felt like they didn’t want to serve us since we did not spend much. Other than that, food was great no complaints :)"
Excellent Italian Meal,Went there several times and no let downs ever. The pizza has just about the right crust thickness and the pasta is pretty authentic.
Rushed and pressured to leave due to allocated timing,"The good:
- Good pasta, good deco and ambiance
- Food comes on time

Improvement:
-The service - we had a 2 hour window to dine but after the 1.15 mins we were asked twice if we want dessert, when we did not even finishing eating our main, we felt rushed and pressured as if they really wanted us to leave soon!
-My friend is allergic to gluten thus it was our mistake we ordered a paella thinking it would be made of rice, when we asked the waiter, he replied 'paella is made of pasta, you did not tell us about the gluten' we told him that usually paella is made of rice and probably we misread but there was nothing, just a blank face our friend ended up only eating the octopus on the plate.

We understand that all the staff are under pressure however for us overall it was an average and rushed experience, not sure we will be back. :("
Good Ambience and food at Amo,"A good place to dine with family and friends. Good ambience, and with authentic pizza and pasta. Definitely revisited."
Nice Italian Restaurant,"I had made a reservation for 4 pax for dinner. The restaurant is nice and has quite a lot of space indoor. They even have seats at the bar and an outdoor patio, which is nice as well. Service staff is good and quite attentive, though on full capacity you can expect some delay. We had booked the dining special 3 course dinner, which was really nice (albeit) just a little less for us to say we were full. Since we had some space left after the fixed menu, we decided to order a pizza to share. It was a pity that they didn’t have happy hour drinks, which we were hoping for. Though we ended up ordering some nice red wine and some mocktails as well. The crab salad was delicious and so was their home made pasta. The pizza was amazing ! Super nice & recommended. I enjoyed the mains too and the dessert tiramisu was nice and fluffy (not decadent) but tasty. The decor is nice and we ended up splurging around $500 for a meal for 4 pax. A tad pricey but since the 4 of us were dining out after a while, it was worth it. A nice chilled out evening."
Lunch with wife,"Restaurant was quickly filled after opening at noon. The pizza was well executed. The cheese platter was really impressive. Service was good too. Overall, good experince."
Worth a visit for some good italian food,"The Fregola with Octopus is excellent, the charcoal flavor enhances the dish. Tasty fresh tomatoes with burrata and pizza worrh to try"
Salty,"Food was good except spaghetti chitarra &ikura ,taste super salty ,is really very bad they still charge us ,otherwise everything is good ,service is good too."
Drinks @ the Bar,"Since I walked in for drinks ONLY so I will only review the bar for now. However, the food looked and the aroma was HEAVENLY so I will tey that next.

The bar manager is extremely friendly and makes absolutely AMAZING drinks. I told him I don't like too much alcohol in my drinks. He made me drinks that had Alcohol and I could not taste it. Oh My Goodness, I have never had three drinks in 2 hours EVER. The drinks were so Unique and soooooooooooo good.

MUST TRY EVERYONE. Head over to AMO and make sure you try out the drinks."
Excellent food and service,"Food was superb. We ordered tuna tartare as starter, signature pizza and squid ink pasta. The thin crust pizza was the best I ever had in Singapore. Highly recommended. We also had tiramisu as dessert for completion. It was an awesome dinner with excellent service from staff, Kirby. Thanks for the lovely night."
Petite tasting menu at restaurant week,"The food is absolutely delicious, service is impeccable and it is very cozy. However the portions for the 4 course lunch menu at restaurant week is too petite (2 bites). We left hungry for more. The cappuccino to end the meal was a nice consolation. Very friendly staff. We enjoyed the experience. Easy to get to."
Great service and delicious food,"This is my second time at Amo and it was again a great experience. Service was wonderful, food was great, and ambience was lovely. Thank you to Amo!"
Dinner @ AMO,"I had a very lovely family dinner at AMO Restaurant last Saturday, 28 August 2021, evening. The food was excellent and the service was attentive without being intrusive. We like the ambience of the restaurant too. Overall, we had a wonderful evening."
Nice meal,Food was not too bad. Service was excellent. Ambience at restaurant was good. It's on the pricey end so glad for the Chope vouchers
Great option for delivery in lockdown,"Ordered Amo for delivery and the food was sensational. The sweet corn, pork, mash, aubergine and spinach salad were really tasty and travelled well. Timely service too. Will certainly order again"
Good Italian food but experience could have been better,"Very tasty Italian food with great selection of antipasti, noodles, pizzas and main courses. Each dish was nicely prepared. Service was average and they charged us for bread - never seen this before especially in this type of restaurant"
1st visit,Spicy Tagtagliatelli (with squid ink on the side) and a bottle of sparkling water. Linen was crisp. Aircon was a bit cold. Have to bring sweater next time.
Nice ambience & enjoyable Italian fare.,"Very happy we were seated in the quieter smaller section as I love dinner without too much disturbances. However, we had to constantly waved for service as the front section was full. Compensated by the Filipino server who was very nice & professional.
Highly recommend
1. Crispy Calamari with Sumac & Sundried Tomato Aioli,
2. Pancetta, Spicy Broccolini, Pumpkin & Smoked Mazzarella,
3. Sardinian Paella, Grilled Octopus, Fregola Pasta, Fava Beans, Cherry Tomatoes
4. Chocolate Tart with Green Tea & Chantilly Cream."
Great!!!,Great date with my lovely partner 💕💕💕 food was great atmosphere perfect for a date night the cheese is making me miss the place already!!!
Ok but not great,Don’t opt for the terrace - looking up you find yourself dining under laundry drying at the flats above - undermines the ambience. Food ok but nothing special and a bit bland / tasteless especially given the price. Service was good and responsive.
That Pancetta Brocollini Pumpkin Pizza; To Die For!,"I've read and seen so many positive reviews of Amo and finally made my way over. This place, the menu, the ambiance, the service - they do not disappoint! :) From point of reservation, to food and drink service, all the way to the friendly goodbyes, the Amo staff were all very helpful and professional. Everyone was making food recommendations, and anticipating top up of drinks before you could even ask for a refill.

My friend and I had their best sellers:
- Pancetta, Spicy Broccolini, Pumpkin and Smoked Mozzarella
- Homemade Spaghetti Chitarra, Anchovy Colatura Butter, Smoked Ikura

Both dishes were amazing and just nice for 2 hungry diners. I'd love to come back again for another meal and would not hesitate to order those 2 dishes again!"
Excellent food & great service,"Amo is a great place for good food with friendly and professional service. We started with Crispy Calamari & Artisanal Burrata Cheese followed by Signature Pizza (Stracciatella, prosciutto, rucola & fig vincotto), Butter roasted chicken and grilled Angus Beef tagliata, The pizza and mains were recommended by our server Kirby and were excellent!!!! They took the effort to place a candle on one of the desserts as we were celebrating a friend's birthday. The ricotta cheese castagnole with moscato sabayon, one of the desserts is a surprise gem.

A great evening made more memorable by the food, service and ambience. Just to note that parking can be challenging and would suggest parking at Central and crossing the road. Will definitely be back."
Great italian food,"Love the pasta at Amo. Everything we ordered were very good. Open kitchen so be prepared to smell of food in your hair and clothes. If not for this, rating would have been a 5!"
Little Gem!,"Had lunch there on a Monday. Place was not too crowded as we were there before noon. Food was awesome, quality of the ingredients was good with elaborate preparation and creative plating. Menu was extensive and varied. We ordered Suckling Pig Chops, Grilled Eggplant Rolls, Burrata Cheese with Tomatoes and Choc tart. We would rate the dishes we had extremely ‘authentic’ and ‘beyond delicious’.
The service rendered was exceptional. The staff welcomed us with hospitable gestures and we were offered a desired table. Kirby, who was thoroughly versed on the menu, ensured that our order was served as soon as it was prepared and also strived to see if the food was alright or if we wish to order more at intervals. He had just the right balance of friendliness and efficiency. Would love to try their handmade pizzas and pastas on the next visit."
Excellent food and service !!!,"Excellent food and the service is top notch. We were served by ""Ganesh"" and he is extremely good with his service. The food is very authentic Italian and will go back again soon."
Great food at reasonable price,"An impromptu dinner with family and managed to get a outdoor table. We ordered a salad, pizza and roast chicken. Everything was delicious. Pizza - thin and crispy, chicken - tender and juicy. The salad was exceptionally good, even though I am not a salad fan. Great service staff too."
CNY 2021 Lunch,"Our choice is always Amo for the 1st day of CNY lunch. We tried the lamb chop, delicious and well cooked. We also had our regular favourites of roasted chicken, pizza and truffle fries. The service here is always consistently attentive, friendly whether it is a holiday or non-holiday."
Fantasic food and superior service,"Food was exceptional - great variety, beautiful presentation and very tasty. Service was on point - very helpful and attentive."
Retro Valentine's,"Ever wanted a throwback V day celebration? Amo has that in spades. Staff told us the QR code for the menu without informing us that there wasn't 4g or WiFi. Cool! I actually had to talk to those physically present at my table! Furthermore, our reservation was at 6 but food arrived only at 715. It may be because they had to forage for ingredients? No idea. Anyway, this is a perfect place for those that have time and have interesting lives (bee keepers?) as you most likely will need to interest your partner with conversational gymnastics. Come here for a digital detox!"
Food is ok but great service,"I saw high bubble rating on google map so wanted to give it a try. Visited the restaurant for lunch and ordered their recommendations, such as pizza with prochute& fig and pumpkin cream pasta with ikura. (sorry, I don't remember the dish name...) The foods were service incredibly fast but the quality is ok... nothing special. To be honest, a bit disappointing as it's not really hot.... There are not much topping on the pizza so I felt like just eating tomato source pizza. As for the pasta, the flavor is too light. I would not recommend this place for food quality, but the service is very attentive and friendly."
Family dinner,"Booked this place 2 weeks in advance for a family dinner on Sunday. The restaurant called on Sunday afternoon to reconfirm our reservation and also told us they will need the table back by 815pm as our reservation was for 615pm.

Just read the earlier reviewer feedback of their unpleasant experience of being rushed to finish their meal in order for the table to be turned. Glad it did not happen to us.

We tried:
1. Sour dough bread with olive oil
2. Calamari
3. Cold cut platter (recommended)
4. Lobster pasta (recommendeded)
5. Grilled Spring chicken with truffle mash
6. Pizza
7. Choco greentea tart and tiramisu

The lobster pasta was tops. One whole lobster with 300 grammes of pasta. The sauce was thick and rich like lobster bisque. Very flavourful.

The overall service was friendly and attentive. Wait staff checked on us regular and asked how is everything. They even offered to change the tiramisu when the over heard that we commented the dessert was too ""soft and mushy"". We didn't. It was a very enjoyable dinner with our 3 kids. We would like to come back to try other food of the menu in the future."
Total Disappointment,"We had been for dinner here before and were looking forward to a nice night out with friends. Instead it was a total disappointment. The quality of the food was good but they may as well has given us our main courses in a takeaway container and told us to eat it at home. Our booking was for the second seating at so shouldn’t have been rushed to finish by 10:30. When we were still having our pasta at 9:30pm, cutlery for our main was being laid on the table amongst our plates while we were eating and we were asked if we had any last orders. There was no reason to rush us, we are aware of the closing time and need to clear any alcohol by 10:30. It was extremely rude and I don’t think the server even realised it when I asked what her rush was. From that point on, it felt like they couldn’t chase us out fast enough. Not what you expect when spending a couple hundred per person on a meal. I’m really disappointed they totally ruined our experience."
Dinner on Christmas Day,"Excellent service and food. Even though it was Christmas Day, the customer service was impeccable. The restaurant had a notably larger number of service staff than other restaurants during this period of the pandemic. I thought the calamari was a bit too salty though the sauce helped to balance it a little. The roast chicken and truffle mash was simply the best, and the tiramisu was also wonderful."
"Patchy, Inconsistent Service","Food was decent. Service was however, patchy. We arrived to be greeted and ushered in by a friendly and polite lady. Once seated, we were served by a waiter (Caucasian) who asked us for the type of water we would like to have. We requested for warm water and he poured some boiling water into our cups. We thought that he would return with some cold water to balance out the temperature of the water, but to our shock, he did not. There is a big difference between warm and boiling water, and it was appalling that a restaurant would believe it is alright for guests to drink boiling water. Zero common sense and tactfulness.

Thankfully, a female waitress (Filipina) we provided feedback to was quick to fix this. Kudos to her, she was pleasant and polite throughout the meal.

Subsequently, I noticed that there was a strand of hair in my water. When I informed a waiter (Indian) about it, he gave a blank look, said nothing, and just took the cup away to replace it. There was not even a basic ‘sorry’ nor any word spoken from the moment he took the cup away to when he returned it. Zero courtesy, zero professionalism. Not the kind of service you would expect from a restaurant like this.

The key observation was that staff at the entrance, as well as the female waitresses tending to guests at the dining table, appeared more professional and polite. The male staff serving guests at the dining table however, need to improve on their tactfulness and professionalism in serving guests. Doubt I’ll be back."
Value for money and cozy ambience,I visited this restaurant as part of company dinner. Service was attentive and fast with generous food portions. The prices were affordable as well. Ambience was great and perfect for having conversations.
Thanksgiving dinner,"Not the best Italian I’ve had in Singapore but their cocktails are phenomenal, the fries was surprisingly amazing, very crunchy, the mushrooms pizza was amazing, I had the whole pizza all for myself and finished it. The plus side is their customers service. Staff and manager were very friendly and attentive, too bad we were too full to order the dessert but the tiramisu looked bomb. Thanks for a great dining experience!"
Never disappointed with Amo,"Fries are a must-have, even if on a no carb diet! Pork sausage, onion and potato pizza is yummy! Meats (beef and pork) were ok. Not fantastic. Cocktails are good enough."
Delicious esp the gluten free pasta,"Went for a weekend lunch, no tables as we didn’t have a reservation but we got a high table which is just fine. Ordered gluten free beef shank pasta which is beefy and luscious with al dente pasta. The fries with truffle mayo is a winner. The sauce is on point, it is addictive. The roasted chicken portion is a bit bigger than expected and those who like their chicken tender and juicy will love it. I prefer a drier chicken with crispier skin so it’s not a dish that I will repeat though my partner disagrees. The truffle mash potato is yummy but not exceptional.

The staff is friendly and helpful. We forgot to inform we wanted gluten free pasta and the manager immediately informed the kitchen. The manager understands the importance of gluten free. My partner has a gastrointestinal autoimmune issue, dining experience is made better when the restaurant has a degree of awareness.

Amo has great ambiance using a mix of black metal, wood, glass and yellow lighting to create a contemporary interior with a whisper of industrial chic. The food is great and it’s hard to find gluten free pasta in Singapore. It’s a little pricey but I’d come back again to try the rest of the menu."
"Good Food, Location is Convenient","Fresh ingredients used and SUPER yummy for all the ANTIPASTI and MAINS we've ordered. Except for the two pizza (mushroom, truffle + Marinara) were quite 'cold'. Didn't felt hot from the stove. But still will go back again."
Lovely Environment and Food,Had a great dining experience at Amo during our visit. All the staff where friendly and very accommodating as we were there with my toddler. The food was great and we just love the overall vibe to the place. Would be back again soon!
First Visit,Our first visit to Amo to celebrate our 29th wedding anniversary. Very pleasant atmosphere and the service staffs are really friendly and attentive. The food is good and value for money. A very good dining experience. Highly recommended.
"Sub-par service, overrated pizza","Overall, try to avoid going for late lunch, they will rush to finish lunch service fast and significantly lower their service level through the process. Pizza came with base too tough, dough is nothing amazing too, seemed like a rush/unattended work in the oven."
review,Food and service are not up to our expectation. Value for money quite low for the lunch menu. Food is a kind of fusion.
Pleasant ambience but average food,This is a spacious bright restaurant with good service. The Tuna tagliatelle and Tagliolini with Ikura were good. The calamari was not memorable. The Iberico Pork Neck and Chilean Sea Bass were both overly salty - the pork was tough and very dense- impossible to eat! Had high expectations as previous reviews were generally good. Most disappointed.
Always welcome!,Always a pleasure to stop by Amo' for a nice Italian bite! Like the atmosphere and the people always professional. Suggestion ... try everything! (Maybe not in one shot!)
Nice ambience,"Overall good dining experience with the restaurant, in terms of their service and food. Was recommended and will also recommend to friends and family."
Disappointing,"at this price point, Amò really didn’t impress. i’ve always loved pumpkin based pizzas but this rendition was too sweet for my liking. would’ve helped if there were more/thicker pancetta slices to help balance the sweetness (akin to the classic melon and prosciutto pairing). the beef shank fettuccine with orange ($28++) didn’t stand out either as i felt that the orange didn’t cut through the overwhelming beef taste enough. the Suckling Poh Chops ($32++) were really tough and the Angus Beef ($48++) came horribly charred on the outside while having a really raw centre despite us requesting for a medium well steak to cater to my brother. it felt like they tried to make the beef smoky but just ended up being so charred that the table had difficulties finishing it. we felt bad returning the dish as my brother had already attempted to eat 1/3 of the dish before eventually giving up. other than the calamari which made it better, was a disappointing experience."
Terrible service by this staff,"Terrible service by this staff named Lee. Food was great. Night spoilt by this Lee

1. I was enquiring abt buying of chope vouchers to be used , which was allowed previously. Lee replied, can’t since IM HERE NOW, I DONT KNOW ABT PREVIOUSLY

2. Halfway through the dinner, Lee came over and inform that we need the table back by 830. And we start our dinner at 7pm

3. Nearing 8pm , Lee came over asking if she can clear the table. And We stil have food on the table

Utterly disappointed by their service !"
Chicken to die for,Second time we visited. All the dishes were wonderful except for the pasta. It was rather bland. It was not as good as we remembered it to be. Maybe the chef had an off day. Of special note though is the roast chicken. It really is to die for. Well worth the visit and will come again. #maneklady #manekeats
Reservation Make No Use,"Terrible reservation rule. I made a reservation through Chope, expected to celebrate anniversary at a wonderful dining atmosphere as showed in pictures. BUT BUT BUT even though we reached there at 6.45pm punctually, the manager lead us to the dining area with 4 walls at behind of the restaurant. Why can't you tell us have such first come first ‘seat’ upfront? We paid for the same amount right."
Candy’s Birthday July,"Booked this place on 22 Jul for dinner to celebrate my girlfriend’s bday! Great ambience & love the tuna tartare, grilled octopus & mushroom pizza! Packed for a weekday evening. Recommend to make early reservations."
Food Still Good But Service Could Be Warmer,"Haven't eaten here in a while so was glad the food is still VERY GOOD. Didn't recognise the staff though as it looked like most of them working there were ""new"". They were ok but not as warm and welcoming as the staff I had met on previous occasions."
Nice lunch,"It was pretty crowded at lunch but service was warm yet quick. I loved my starter of pasta with squid ink, which had a nice level of spiciness, while my wife enjoyed her burrata.

We both had the beef main course. We wish there were more pieces, but the three we did have was pretty good. Mine was slightly chewy, but there was no gristle.

Dessert was chocolate slice, which had a nice hit of citrus. It was rich chocolate, so much so that we were not able to finish it. We saw neighboring tables having pizzas - they looked good and we will be back to try them.

They are part of the Aura group, which includes Art at National Gallery."
Excellent experience !,A Jem found in the city. Food nicely prepared and delicious. Restaurant have a warm deco too. Glad to have to try this gem found !
could be better,"good service and good promotion. truffle pizza was a crowd pleaser but apart from that, nothing was spectacular."
Delicious 🇮🇹,"As neighbouring restoran was closed we stepped in to Amo for a dinner. Excellent experience. Elegant interior, welcoming staff and everything tasty. Especially would point out tuna tartar, one of the top ones I never had. Place highly recommended!"
Italian restaurant excellent,"when I entered this restaurant I felt like I was in Italy. Very comfortable and well-cared for restaurant, an elegant table for the best occasions. Kindness and professionalism of the staff who welcomes you with excellent olives as an aperitif, delicious pizza with excellent refined ingredients, the moment of dessert arrived, we ordered a tiramisu and it too exceptional. The wine list is amazing with the best Italian and French wineries. Dinner ended with the best espresso ever drunk abroad and competition with the best Italian bars. Friendliness of Director Jody who gave us great advice on Singapore. We will definitely return to this wonderful Italian restaurant two minutes walk from Clarke Quay."
Valentine’s Day special,"We made a very last minute reservation to celebrate Valentine’s Day at Amò as I saw they were offering Valentine’s Day sharing menu and decided to give it a first try. I was pretty impressed by the great ambience as we walked in and were seated in the back of the restaurant with a bit more private space. Highlights of the night were the mushroom/truffle pizza and lobster pasta.

Truffle Pizza: freshly baked with a crispy yet chewy dough, flavorful mushrooms and a touch of truffles. My boyfriend usually don’t eat mushrooms but surprisingly this pizza has changed his perspective on mushrooms!

Lobster pasta: lobster was perfectly cooked and tender. I’ve always enjoyed the intense taste of lobster bisque but I find their sauce on a bit saltier side, and also a bit disappointed by the infusion of asian gravy. Overall it’s definitely not comparable with the lobster pasta I had in Boston, but we still enjoyed it a lot.

Angus beef: we made a wrong decision by having our steak cooked medium well. The taste and presentation was great but unfortunately a bit too dry and overcooked.

Tiramisu: disappointing. Wish there’s stronger coffee taste soaked in the mascarpone.

Overall we had an amazing night here with great wine."
Ottimo,I ve had a great dinner in this restaurant. Great menu gluten free. Restaurant absolutely perfect from service to food. Same i can say about design. Very good homemade bread gluten free with olive oil. Sure one of my best place to Singapore.
Enjoyable experience,"It was our first time to Amo. Located at a busy street. The food was good, especially the pasta. We would look forward to coming back again."
3rd visit and it's still good,"Went there for lunch. The Mushroom Pizza was amazing as ever. I normally dont finish the pizza crust. But it was so good. We cleaned out everything. We also ordered the 2 set lunches. The Gnocchi was a clap. And the Cod was delicious. Overall the food was as good as ever. For dessert, we tried the Lemon Baba. It was well balance. Will definitely visit again."
Nice looking interior - unprofessionally organized & worse: pathetic pizza. Overpriced & overhyped.,"That any restaurant claiming to be so much better than average could run out of paper(!!!) dinner serviettes beggars the mind, but one that is supposed to make stunning pizza (& charge over$30++(!!!!!) into the bargain ..but can’t manage to even deliver same hot to table should curl up in shame!
And to make maters worse, the REPLACEMENT pizza base was soggy & inedible! OMG!!

Their lauded Rosemary Fries side dish is nice enough, but the ‘rosemary’ bit is a joke ...it’s just a few leaves scattered on top!..$12++ ? Hardly value!

Service ( so-called) was erratic at best & with the poor kitchen work & overpriced menu items, this is trendoid pseudo-dining that’s so overhyped it’s laughable.

Don’t be conned...you can do far better elsewhere."
Good service from Arvin Ligon,"Great service from Arvin Ligon - from point of booking a table reservation, to food recommendations, was very enjoyable!"
Indubitably the best restaurant,"Indubitably the best restaurant in Singapore, great service, genuine and passionate cuisine and the TRUE Italian pizza."
