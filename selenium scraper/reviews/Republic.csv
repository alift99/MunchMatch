Everything you want in a bar.....,"A really warm and friendly bar with friendly staff, great atmosphere and equally great cocktails. What's not to like?"
"Great drinks, amazing staff","I was doing my typical yearly travel, and it had been a while I'd gone to Singapore since the Pandemic. Talking to some people in Clarke Quay, they told me to check out The Republic.
Let me tell you what, wow! The place was absolutely amazing, and the staff took very good care of you. Especially Marjo, she was so attentive to myself, other customers and even her fellow co-workers.
Drinks there were not just a work of art, but were smooth and delightful. I wanted to try something new and Marjo offered me 2 to try the Leader Jacket and Breakfast in Tiffany. I dont think I'd ever had 2 drinks me so amazing. Marjo really knew what to offer the person she was serving.
Next time I'm back in Singapore, I'll be returning."
"Love the vibe, Everyone should try it once if you visit in Singapore","Was served by the lovely crew of Republic.
A special thanks to all Colleen, Sungzhe, Olivia & Ryan at the bar for taking such a good care of me since I am alone.

Special shoutout to Colleen for her cute and bubbly character and making me feel at home.

Her skill in mixology and story telling on the cocktails' origins are truly enjoyable!"
Comfortable & Not Pretentious. Christmas Drinks Now Available!,"It's that time of year again... & Republic Bar has a Festive Cocktails menu with 5 options (at $26++ a pop) to get your Christmas spirit on. AvailableAvailable daily 'til 31st December 2022, from 5:30pm onwards.

I couldn't pass up Eggnog (pictured in the tall glass, next to the Negroni), as it is one of my favourite things about Christmas - especially the alcoholic variant. Creamy, sweet drinks deviate vastly from my typical go-to flavour profile for cocktails... But this is probably the only exception.

Expectedly, this is dangerously easy to drink. Quite reminiscent of when I'd put Bailey's in my milk & cereal, & sit at the back of the LT to inconspicuously slurp it up during class. But this drink is better, in part because it isn't as sweet as the ""cereal milk"" left behind post-meal.

The lightness in the whipped texture of cream & egg provides a comforting mouthfeel in every sip. & as you swallow, you get the warm contrasting depth of the dark spirits - Barcadi 8 & Michter's Bourbon. Of course, there is that touch of nutmeg for a homely Christmas feel... The warm hug that envelopes everything so nicely together.

I enjoyed this from start to finish, but am cognizant that I might be a little bit biased, festival-wise. Try it for yourself & pass your own judgement

-

Hot Buttered Rum ($26++) was recommended by one of the friendly waitresses. I originally thought I'd stop at 1 Christmas drink, having had a few from the regular menu already... But this sounded too good to pass up.

I was pleasantly surprised.. I loved this even more than Eggnog! Super baffled - because I eat my kaya toast without butter (don't judge), yet I'd happily drink a litre of this warm, comforting buttery rum...? What sorcery is this!?

Perhaps it was the simplicity of this drink that won me over: Bacardi 8, butter, festive spices. & as I'd mentioned above, it's served warm. So past the creamy top that gives you a comical moustache, you get that warm fuzzy feeling inside that feels almost self-healing. Mana regen ftw.

Other drinks on Republic Bar's Festive Cocktails menu (available 5:30pm onwards daily, 'til 31 Dec 2022):

Amazing Bar,"Have visited here twice in last few weeks. Very kind and welcoming staff. Sat at the bar both time with my wife and then a colleague. Amazing cocktails, food and atmosphere. Will come again for sure."
birthday surprise for my spouse,Delicious food and amazing service. Staff were very hospitable and food was very filling. They had a mixture of different courses served and well as the main platter for hi-tea. Made a very good choice choosing them for my other half special day :)
"Exceptional service, beautiful ambience, and a brilliant playlist!","Exceptional service by Ryan (behind the bar). Cocktails were well-curated and pleasantly executed -- especially love the story behind each drinks (in addition to the local touch). As a history buff and lover of the '60s, Republic Bar is where I see myself visiting over and over again. The feature wall donned a couple of my favourites too! I had a lovely time!

P.S. I loved how the playlist suit the theme of the bar too!"
You must visit this bar,"The staff are amazingly attentive and the bartenders are so friendly. What is great for cocktail lovers, they do bespoke as well which is absolutely fantastic."
Republic - excellent,The whole service team is very professional and knowledgeable in making food and drink recommendations. Every staff member works very hard every evening to ensure that patrons have a positive experience. Kudos to the whole team.
Very memorable service by Ryan,"Visited Republic with a friend and met the friendliest bartender Ryan. He was very attentive to our needs, checking on us every now and then to make sure everything is OK. Food portion was a little small but delicious. Very romantic and cozy ambience, loved the plush chairs and music selection as well. Would definitely visit again!"
Afternoon tea,It was our 1st time in Republic for a high tea. Customer service is good and the food choices are excellent. Love the ambiance and the music.
Additional ingredient in your food...,"Came here for the weekday high tea and it was so disappointing.

The waiter for our table was Dunston and he was coming way too strong - he asked ""are you excited for the high tea?!"" to which my heavily pregnant and tired sister responded with a no. And he had to respond back ""why not? why aren't you excited?"". Please learn how to read the room and body language of your customers. What must've been a well-intended act of hospitality ended up being a huge turn off and unpleasant start to our afternoon.

But that wasn't the worst part. Barely into the high tea, I was surprised by an additional ingredient in my dish. In the 2nd course, a salmon wellington-esque pastry dish, I was stunned by a rather big piece of PLASTIC in my dish. I've had only sliced it in half and was stunned by this translucent additional ingredient sticking out like a sore thumb.

I thought it could've been a piece of onion or perhaps leek, so I picked it up with my fingers and tried to shred it. I wish it was indeed onion/leek, but It wasn't fibrous at all and was almost like a piece of raffia string. I was incredibly turned off and called for the manager and waiter to bring out the chefs. They were indeed remorse and the manager asked multiple times how she could make it up to us - ""how about a free cake?"" she asked.

At that point, I've lost all appetite and even felt like puking though I only ate a few pieces of chips from the 1st round lol. No way in hell would I eat anything else from this place so the cake, while well-intended again, was the last thing on my mind for them to try and make things right. We left the bar as a whole and said the only way to make things right would be to just write the rest of the course off and let us leave. We had a much more pleasant high tea at TWG instead.

Perhaps Republic Bar is better off just as a bar than serving any food or high tea. Please leave the food serving to The Colony opposite instead - I've been eating there for YEARS (back when they were still called Greenhouse) and they've been rather consistent with their food & service. This experience with Republic was the opposite and such a letdown."
"Good food, great drinks and exceptional service!","I have been to Republic Bar twice in the past two weeks, returning the second time because of the lovely experience I had on my first visit. The first one was for dinner and drinks with my husband, and we had a great evening. The wine and cocktails were excellent, and we enjoyed the bar bites as well, our favourites being the truffle arancini which were crispy outside, warm and fluffy inside, the corn dogs which had a fantastic breading and came with the yummiest gooey mac and cheese croquettes, the flavourful pork toast, a creative riff on the classic chinese dish, and, my personal favourite, the brioche ice cream sandwich which, with the raspberry ice cream and peanut nougat, reminded me of an upscale pb&j sandwich. My second visit with a friend was equally enjoyable, with more great wine, a complimentary small glass of champagne which we much appreciated, and another tasty dish, the braised beef short ribs, which were unbelievably tender and served with the most gorgeous pillowy steamed buns. Also a hit were the chocolate pralines we chose out of the display case, a caramel, hazelnut and coconut one, which were clearly of a very high quality, just divine.

But the best part about both visits was the service. I didn't get the names of our primary servers, which I regret, because they were excellent. The first evening was a lovely young woman who was warm and engaging, and an equally friendly gentleman served us the next time. The service was attentive, helpful and not overbearing, and everyone who helped us had great menu knowledge, both of the food and drinks on offer. The hosts who greeted and seated us, as well as the bartenders, were equally top notch. Really a fantastic service experience, and one of many reasons we'll be back again!"
Top Notch Outstanding Bar,"The Bar has excellent character, class and mood spaces to wind you down after a long day or party mood …paired with great food selection and drinks, spoiled by the service team and culinary offerings, great music are just simply a perfect concoction of a GREAT Bar which I have come to enjoy on a occasions.
The concept of great Gatsby brought forward to modern times makes this bar sleek and sophisticated, the variety of international cocktails are just amazing, experienced mixologist who are knowledgeable, friendly running the stunning looking Bar! Martin leading the Bar Operations with his team are excellent,… just leave the choices of cocktails recommendation to Martin & his team to plan for the evening, he’ll set you up for a nice Grand Prix paced evening of cocktails!
The bar food are creative and delightful, great work by the friendly Chefs who delivers food personally time to time such as Chef Raj who leads the bar kitchen.
Mr Phil the crooner in his avant- garde ‘Ricky Suave’ look in blue swanky suit will welcome you and keeps you company with a good friendly chat and his personal recommendations of cocktails + food paring. You can actually have dinner with the great food menu!!! Dunstan at service are always friendly and obliging.
Thank you for to Mr Rudi The Manager and his wonderful team who recognises his guests very well and always so welcoming and friendly. Along with Rudi and the team of service and kitchen professionals are what make this a great Bar even more special with it’s beautiful decor and style."
Great Lunch Again,"Had lunch with the family here and it was a pretty good experience. Service was warm and friend,y, as usual, and the chef even came out to introduce some of the dishes.

The amuse bouche was a nice start to the meal, and was followed by prawn cocktail and iberico ham. Both were well presented and tasty. The prawns, especially, were plump and fresh.

We all opted for the fish and chips as our mains. The cod was fresh and flaky, and the batter was just nice. The best thing about the dish were the shoestring fries, which went great with the aioli. The green pea sauce was also nice.

Dessert was affogato with Nespresso coffee, and it was a nice end to the meal.

They do high tea from 12 noon as well, and quite a few tables were having that."
AMAZING! A Five Star experience,"Republic bar is stunning in design and layout. We liked it so much on the first night we went back for a second night. The staff here are super friendly, attentive, and engaging. The cocktails and drinks are beautifully presented and made with passion. The two barmen were simply charming, engaging, also knowledgable about all the drinks and they gave recommendations based on our likes. The food was incredible and presented so well, so delicious! There are lots of very special touches made with regards to the drinks and food. The service is exceptional and you will be made to feel very welcome. Bravo to the management and staff who have created this fantastic bar experience. We can't wait to return. Simon & John Livingston-Harwood"
Republic is the new chihuly lounge,"2 years since my last visit to chihuly lounge. Things has since changed.

A new Republic it is now. But the same standard of service as before and food that is unique yet down to earth. Let the photos do the talking.

Today is my first visit to the Republic and it won't be my last.

Thank you Dunstan Chew for the service and introduction of Republic to me and my guest. A shout out to Rudy for the warm welcome back. And not forgetting Martin for the great drinks.

Highly recommended for frens or business hang out."
First Great Experience!,"There was nothing we disliked about my experience at the Republic bar in the Ritz Carlton Millennia Singapore. The servers were extremely friendly and welcoming. Wawa, Duston, Jenny, Jeremy & Phil were all extremely helpful and they made us feel at home."
Excellent service,Visited for high tea. Dunstan and team were always attentive and provided excellent service. Food wise menu was interesting and of great quality. Would consider returning again for lunch/dinner.
Great service with joyful ambiance,"It was an amazing experience throughout the entire dining experience.

Leading by Liz and Rudi and Roselle, the whole team members are very professional.

Jenny recommend us the cod dish impressed us with the quality and taste.

Gina presents the hi tea with all the details and ingredients which grow our knowledge better.

Dunstan and Jeffery’s drink offering option is also works very well after we were overwhelmed by the food!!

Will definitely come back again and recommend Republic to my friends!!!"
Beyond expectations,Chanced upon this restaurant during the Singapore Restaurant Week event. Lunch set was priced at $48++ per person. The menu looks simple when I made the reservation. But oh mine was I pleasantly surprised the minute I stepped into the restaurant! The high ceiling and sky light sure brightened my day! The service was impeccable and personal. Staff were friendly. Food was AMAZING. I closed my eyes to savour the first bite of every dish. Every single course made me wanna grow wings and fly into heaven. And the presentation of the food was pure art! Love it! Thank you!
Ideal place for afternoon tea,The service from each and every stuff member is impeccable (server Dunstan stands out) and the food was well executed and nicely plated. We especially love the Bruschetta and the Ice cream Brioche.
One of the best service experiences!,"Bought the afternoon high tea from Klook and was very impressed with the warm and friendly service by ALL the staff, especially Dunstan who was very attentive and helpful, Kim who helped us greatly with the reservations and Liz who helped with dietary restrictions. Food was good and very worth the price paid, only thing we would have preferred is if there were more savory instead of sweet items. But will definitely go back just for the service alone!"
Excellent And Warm Service,"This was the best meal we have had this week, during Restaurant Week. Service by the two young ladies was excellent, and they were friendly and also popped by frequently to top up water etc. The overall ambience was great, with lots of light and a lovely high ceiling and decor.

The amuse bouche was a good start but the best dish, we felt, was the chowder, which was creamy and full of flavour. The garlic bread was so good that we asked for two additional slices. The bruschetta was okay, but a tad oily.

The fried pork chop was good, but I enjoyed the delicious rice better. The pork was crispy and tasty, but I became a little jelak of it near the end. The chilli con carne was similar - tasted good starting out, especially with the sour cream, chopped onions and chives, but my wife did not finish it fully.

The ice cream sandwich was okay. The ice cream was a delight, but the two sliced pieces of bread were not a good accompaniment. We did like the peanut crumble. The raspberry and pistachio mini cake was not mini in size, but was a good ending to the meal."
New favourite afternoon tea spot in town!,"The best part about this afternoon tea place is that it's from 12pm to 5pm and there is no restriction on how long you can stay there. We booked a 1.30pm slot and had a relaxing afternoon tea experience until 5pm. We also had unlimited refills of tea and we managed to try 5 different flavours between us - highly recommend the Irish Whiskey Cream & Morgentau teas. Besides the 5 courses, we were also served with an amuse bouche. Scones were warm and fluffy and their sweet items didn't disappoint.
Overall, we had an amazing experience with friendly and attentive service provided by Dunstan and the team. Looking forward to my next visit, hopefully when the menu changes."
Perfect 10/10 experience,"The high tea set was excellent. The cocktails were so intriguing and left us wanting for more.

What’s even more amazing was the level of service offered by the staff. Kudos to the staff: Dunstan, Phil, Jenny, Jeffrey, Regina, Gina!

The staff were engaging and friendly, and personable at all levels. Their attention to details was definitely a major plus for the overall experience here.

Strongly recommend this place!"
Considered one of the best bar,"The head bartender was so polite ,great in service. Food was amazing. Highly recomment to chill and unwind"
Birthday Celebration with a Bang,"A relatively new spot to whilst away the afternoons. Charming old world vibes with elegance of an English dining room (replacing Chihuly Lounge), it makes an intimate setting for tea session with girlfriends. in fact we had the whole restaurant to ourselves since it was on a weekday.

We were served with Queen’s Scones Tea, a delicious sweet mocktail upon arrival. Followed by amuse bouche, marshmallows, scones and a modern five-tier tea set. Selections lean towards the sweets and wish it was more balanced though Soursop Sorbet was a great way to end the meal.

Excellent service by Jenny, Dunstun and team! Other than addressing us on first name basis, making small talks and explaining the dishes, they were thoughtful to prepare a birthday cake for us. Plus they actual went out of the way to help us take a good group shoot too."
Amazing experience,"I had an amazing experience here at republic bar. From lunch to hightea, I have been greeted by fantastic customer service by Liz, Jenny, Regina, Kim, Wahida and Dunstan. I would definitely come back again!"
Superb service my bachelorette,"Came to Republic for my bachelorette party with some friends and had an amazing time!

Food was innovative and delicious and the drinks selection recommended to us was perfect. Very engaging staff as well who took the time to come over interact and even gave us a complimentary round of drinks! Rudi brought us in and introduced the concept to us and Wahida, Gina, Phil and Dunstan served us to ensure personalised service and we felt very taken care of.

They were very accommodating with the decor and indulged us with many photos as well. Bartender Martin also recommended a coffee based drink for our final drink of the evening which we loved.

Overall a great experience especially with the staff and ambience! Thank you Ritz!!"
Amazing first visit!,Everyone in the bar were approachable and checked on us often to ensure we were enjoying our night. A shout-out to Dunstan for his in-depth knowledge of the menu and history behind the cocktails. His recommendations were spot on and apt for my taste. Will definitely visit again!
An overdue date,"Excellent food, interesting cocktails and impeccable service. Can't ask for more. Will definitely come back for drinks and tapas with my friends."
Choice for afternoon high tea,Great ssrvice and nice ambience. Food was good too. Definitely a place to hang out with friends. Highly recommended!!!
Amazing Bar Experience,"Warm welcome by the team members upon arrival. They have taken the extra mile to check if we would like to explore the newly renovated Republic Bar by Tony Chi.

Mr. Rudi recommended two cocktails to us, Timeless Beauty and Satisfaction. Totally blown off by the first sip.
Food was well thought of, bite size portion for sharing, dishes are specially curated to complete the experience,

Overall experience was definitely over my expectation - as always.
Will be coming back to have more chill out with the ladies!"
Fabulous new bar and great experience!,"Had an overall great experience, not just fabulous drinks by a great concept at the Republic Bar narrated by Rudi. Jenny was exceptional with her drinks suggestion and the entire service team did a great job. Definitely recommend the place and will visit again."
Worth going again and again,"Ambience was great. The cocktail menu was creative, taste is complex and presentation was on point. Service was memorable right from the front door, to ordering and even departing. Special shutout to Dunstan Chen for recommending and introducing the story behind each cocktail. He takes an effort to remember each guest name, his cheerful deposition is a great delight and he takes pride in his role. If not for the other appointment, we would have stayed for another drink. Highly recommended!
Also had a mention in Instagram @tipplesnfizz"
Fantastic new bar at the Ritz,"Thanks Rudi for an amazing night at Republic! Fantastic ambience, great cocktails and great food. Will be coming back for Fish & Chips very soon!"
Wonderful hi-tea experience,"Had a wonderful hi-tea experience with the ambience and food. Thank you Dunstan, Chuckie, Jenny, Regina, Liz and Gina for the great hospitality. Will return to try the historical cocktails."
Wonderful lunch experience.,A very wonderful lunch experience with my friends at Republic. Very good food at reasonable price and excellent service. Special mention to Mr Dunstan for his patience and attentativeness in making our lunch hour so so so pleasant.
Amazing High Tea Session accompanied with outstanding service,"The High tea set was really good & worth the money. Highly recommended to all the high tea lovers out there! Special mention to Dunstan, Phil, Wahida & Jenny. They really made us feel welcomed & comfortable the whole time. They even went the extra mile of asking our needs, whether we are good & explaining the details of the food items. Kudos to the whole team for their outstanding service. Would definitely go there again to try their other menus such as the cocktail menu."
A bright & warm Sunday Brunch,"A beautiful space for afternoon tea in the lounge & an intimate and handsomely decorated bar. Afternoon tea and lunch was delicious, artfully done and well enjoyed in the spacious lounge. The cocktail menu is complex and intriguing, tasteful stories for each glass served at the 1960s inspired bar. Congratulations and a good welcome again to The Ritz Carlton Singapore. Thank you Phil, Jenny, Wahida, Chuckie, Regina, Liz, Dunstan, Konstantine, Martin & Ralph for such an endearing afternoon. Cheers to good times."
Amazing Afternoon Tea!,"Went on a Sunday noon, very nice environment to chill on a Sunday. Excellent service from all the staff, especially Dunstan & Sharon! Definitely will be back for more~"
Early Birthday Celebration,"Went to dine in with my friend for her early birthday celebration and the service provided by Dunstan, Gina and Wahida were very warm and welcoming. They were very friendly and we found it such an enjoyable time to have a chat with them and they are all really attentive as well. Special thanks to Dunstan for making the reservation and the birthday cake arrangement."
Excellent 8-course Afternoon Tea,"Had a wonderful afternoon tea time at Chihuly Lounge! Food was excellent and they had a variety of tea selections. We were served by three amazing staff; a Korean lady, Dunstan and Wahida. They explained the dishes well and made us feel at home. If you ever need great photos, please ask for Wahida!"
Outstanding Afternoon Tea,"Wow----what an excellent experience we had celebrating a friend's birthday here. The Afternoon Te was a little different than the European versions but it was superb. From the service to the ambiance to the delectable hot and cold finger dishes served buffet style. We were immediately served with cold and pretty moctails as soon as were seated. Also, great birthday cake surprise towards the end. Great tea selection. The only con was that you are stuck with just one tea selection----switching and sampling another tea was not allowed! Despite this, it is still highly recommended!"
Excellent high tea and nice service.,There are a lot of nice staff especially Dunstun and Weinei and Liz choi. We got a very great service from them! It’s very memorable. And of course high tea is super yummy! Thank you so much for your service!
Service & Ambience,"Excellent service (i.e. very attentive service staff), good spread and ambience. Highly recommended if you are looking for a nice place to chill on a Sunday afternoon."
Amazing high tea experience,Great spread and ambience will definitely be back again for more! The staff are very friendly too which play a part in elevating the great dining experience.
Fantastic service,Had a great time at Chihuly lounge. Was greeted by warm and friendly staff who explained the menu in details. They were very attentive at all times. Dustin and Regina and all serving (so sorry I didn’t remember all their names) where very professional with a personal touch. They are really the ambassadors of Ritz Carlton. The ambience is fantastic as well amidst COVID-19.

Phenomenal,"Had an 8course weekday high tea at chihuly, hospitality by service staff was fantastic. Special mention to Liz, Winnie, Ruben, Ralph, Gina and Chef Sam"
So great as always!!!!!!!,"Hospitality was amazing as usual! From the entire team and Dunstan. Really great service, food and ambiance was prefect love it!!!!!!! 🥰"
Amazing 2 Year Anniversary High Tea Buffet,We spent our 2 year anniversary at the Chihuly for a high tea buffet. The food selection is so varied and you can tell the care in gastronomically matching different flavours and textures. My favorite were the soba and wagyu dish and the red wine sorbet. Wish there were more scones but the incredible amount of desserts made up for it. Also special thanks to Sandrine who helped us during our visit. Thank you! Will be coming again for another special occasion soon I hope!
Very nice experience,First time having high tea in Chihuly Lounge. Nice atmosphere and delicate food. The service makes us feel very easy and comfortable. The staff Dunstan who attended to us is very friendly and helpful. Very enjoyable experience.
wonderful afternoon tea with professional and hospitable staff,"This is my first time having high tea at chihuly lounge. There was a pretty good variety of food and beverages to choose from. The scallop confit and tuna and soba dishes were our favourites.

Special mention to Dunstan who attended to us. He was very professional and he made the high tea experience even more enjoyable with his warm and friendly disposition. He made effort to engage us and attend to our request. Indeed, he has helped to make our afternoon tea experience a wonderful one and we will be back again."
Very Nice,"Heard about this place from friends and because we were staying near the Ritz, we wandered in. Mistake...! we staggered out 4.5 hours later.......sheesh.....but good."
Beautiful bar with great service.,Excellent bar with A-List service. Sandrine and her team and very personal and the bar’s ambience is fantastic with great lighting during the day and is very cozy at night.
Great service,"Had dinner at Chihuly Lounge with my friends and the service was excellent! We were greeted with a smile by Winnie who gave us a great recommendation on the menu which helped us a lot, the bartender Michelle and Ralph was also very friendly and the drinks was awesome!
There was also warm welcomes and small talks with Gina who always showed us her amazing smile, Apar who really made us feel like home and Casey which made the day better!
The food was also amazing, favourite would be the calamari thank you chefs.
Would definitely go back again one day! Thank you for the excellent service"
Special dishes for afternoon tea with a good mixture of sweet and savoury items,"Booked an afternoon tea session at Chihuly Lounge. They were having their Christmas menu which the desserts and cakes were mainly Christmas related items. I was pleasantly surprised by their cold seafood appetisers. The staff were very attentive and friendly as well, as they always invited feedback whenever a service was provided/ food or drinks were served."
Best Customer service,"I'm not one to write reviews. In fact this is my first review ever. I'm writing to say that I had the pleasure of being served by Apar, who was incredibly kind to suggest cocktails and types of tequila to someone who has not tried many options. He holds conversations greatly and to my surprise he has only been working in hospitality for the past 2 months.

Highly recommend striking up a conversation with him, if not just for a good laugh."
Weekday Afternoon Tea,"This is my second time having an afternoon tea session, and the lounge never fails to impress me with the decadent menu items coupled with its Impeccable service from the friendly and welcoming staff. Definitely would be back here again soon."
Top Service,Lovely to sit here and relax to have morning or afternoon tea & coffee or a drink. Just sit here and watch the world go by and people entering or leaving hotel.
🤩 underrated coffee cocktails. Irish Coffee is a must here!,Had a wonderful evening spent at this bar — it’s so underrated considering how Singapore is the cocktail capital in Asia. Bartender Martin makes amazing coffee cocktails that even industry bartenders can be inspired from! Special shoutout to Sandrine for the attentive service 🍑
Average offerings from the 8 course week day afternoon tea,"For starters, the 8-course affair is dispensed with little fanfare. From the moment you're seated, they stagger the courses in awkward intervals, not knowing when they should serve you the next. We found it strange that the service staff did not know better to clear the previous course before serving up the next. We ended up with a clutter of dishes on our tiny table each time & had to instruct them to remove plates.

The little cakes on the stand were generally good but if you're expecting fancy creations, it'll disappoint. This reminded us of the offerings from the courtyard at the fullerton. Decent but not artful. Apologies for being a snob about this but when you have your little tea time escapades at places like the ritz, you expect a little more.

The savouries of breads and petit canapés were classic. A tad disappointing actually when they couldn't even pull off a decent ham sandwich. Ham was chopped up, mixed in a cream sauce and spooned into a bone-dry bun. Scones were also dry and hard. Frankly, if not for the high-ceilinged, elegant setting of the chihuly lounge, this spread would have been depressing.

This was salvaged by the turkey roulade served at the start, flavourful, moist and fresh from the chaffing dishes situated between the tables. These were plated by the waiters just before serving. We also enjoyed an ice cream course, creamy and refreshing and somewhat different in presentation.

The let-down was the final course, where they presented each table with a dozen samples of chocolates, little breads and cookies. Here's the kicker. You could only pick 6 out of these! Golly, imagine bring presented a bag of goodies and being instructed (like little kids) that you're permitted to only pick out a few!?! Welcome to the Ritz of today.... where your indulgence is limited!

This afternoon tea wasn't just lacking in creativity, it also lacked a luxurious edge. Perhaps the faults laid in the execution. Service was spotty. We had perhaps only 2 out of 6 waiting staff who appeared confident enough whilst only nervous giggles and empty replies came from the rest.

If this is the standards people are waxing lyrical about, we're certainly not returning to the Chihuly lounge."
Excellent,"Had an excellent experience here. Not only was ambience perfect for the setting, staff were both very attentive and helpful. The Chihuly glass art work is outstanding and a pleasure to enjoy while at the lounge. Plz give this review a thumbs up"
Afternoon drinks,"Perfect ambience for a afternoon or evening cocktail!! Special mention to Ralph for introducing his cocktail , Jenny Liz, Gina, Sandrine , Dunstan , Janice and Winnie"
Had a good time!,"We did enjoy our afternoon tea buffect at Chihuly Lounge. Duston took care of us and his service is excellent. Thank you for the complementary birthday cake and for your hospitality, Duston! From, Sitt and Khin"

Good service provided by Delwyn,The service provided by Delwyn was excellent and drinks were served on a timely fashion and was delicious. Need more of such friendly staff to attract customers.
Friendly & professional staffs,"Had a very late dinner with friends. The kitchen lounge is already closed, but the staffs was kind enough to allow us to order room service’s menu, although we need to wait for the food quite a while."
Fancy old fashioned,"It’s the last night in Singapore, and I got the best mix in my whole journey. Martin is the best to probe the best mix for you and the tell the story behind. And Rudi, Jenny and Gina. Thank you for the best service you provided.

這是在新加波的最後一晚，經過友人的介紹來到了Chihuly Lounge. Martin 是一個非常優秀並且博學多聞的一名Bartender. 先後點了 old fashioned 以及 以威士忌做基酒的調酒，兩杯都完全沒有讓人失望，而娓娓道來的雞尾酒故事也讓這次的體驗加分了不少。同時也想感謝在吧檯的 Rudi, Jenny, Gina所提供的高品質服務。"
Nice bar and friendly staff,"After a long day meetings and schedule, I went to the bar for few drinks myself. The atmosphere of the bar was quite nice and comfortable. Staff in the bar were also quite friendly to me. It is a good place to cool down after having a long day."
Nightcap,"Came by the lounge for a quick drink and bite late at night with a couple of friends. The kitchen was just about to close but Sandrine and all the staff were very patient in giving us their recommendations and we didn’t have to wait long for the food to be served. The guys are the bar led by Martin was amazing, too! Loved the Irish Coffee and Helena and how thoughtful it was prepared in front of us. Though we were not the only ones at the bar/lounge that night, we felt really cared for. Definitely coming back!"
Terrible experience,Variety and quality of food was poir. Only one live station that closed promptly at 5 without warning. My friends did not manage to try the desserts as a result.
Exceptional service at the Chihuly Lounge,"Was brought to Chihuly Lounge by my boss for a relaxing evening.

Exceptional service from the staffs. Special shout out to Sandrine, Jenny and Winnie for making our evening even more enjoyable with the lovely conversations and attention given.
