"Great service, average food","Service was great, very friendly waiters who make sure you're comfortable and are very attentive. Food is very average however - soup was tasteless while thenDiavola was incredibly salty. Doesn't taste very authentic either and seems more like a localised version of Italian cuisine."
Love the food + warm service!,"We loved the food here. Authentic Italian fare - almost similar to what we had in Italy. Service staff were very attentive, ensuring that we were comfortable, and asked about how the food was. One of the staff (we forgot his name) also explained to us the special dishes of the day, and we could feel the sincerity.

Our glasses were also almost never empty as they ensured to fill our glasses regularly. We'll be back!"
Good but could be better,"Mostly it's about food - last time it was excellent and now it's average. Okay for cafe level, not enough for a fancy restaurant."
Weekend Dinner,"The service was good and so was the food, I am a vegetarian and there were few vegetarian options available. A few more additions to vegetarian menus is required."
"Great service, good food","Celebrated my husband's birthday. The food was above average, and the service was great.The ambience was nice although the tables were too close together. Otherwise a good experience."
"Fantastic Service, Fantastic Food",The staff has to be commended for their impeccable service. Came here to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and it went way better than I had envisioned. The food was delicious and well balanced.
Awesome dining experience at etna,My friends and I enjoyed our dinner thoroughly at Etna recently. The food was excellent and the service was unsurpassed! The service staff were highly attentive and were always happy to recommend the food to their diners.
Always amazing,We go there quite often. The Burrata is our must-have. Followed by the Lobster Ravioli! Service staff also very attentive and friendly.
Must try ! Food is excellent,Very good food and very good service ! Prices are reasonable. Only constructive feedback is the restaurant design is too old fashion and is not up to the food quality level. 👍🏻 for the chef and the service staff
Some staff disappoint,"We have been going to Etna’s for over 7 years and seen many changes in staff. It has always been one of our favourite locals. Consistantly good food and often a different wine recommendation to try. Last night the food was good and the recommendation for wine was great. Our server who we recognised was as always gracious and helpful. However I was dismayed that a number of staff did not wear their masks correctly. One continually just under his nose even after I had asked him to wear it properly. Also kitchen staff preparing food with their mask under their chin. We actually raised it with the hostess who told us dismissively that the chef needs to smell the food.

Etna staff - you can do better than this!"
Yummylicious food with great ambience.,My visit to Etna didn't dissapoint me with excellent choice of food recommended by Miss Sharleen. A MUST try dishes are the lobster ravioli and grilled octopus. Loving the warm service and ambience. Thank you Miss Sharleen for being patience with us. Will definitely visit again with more friends.
"Amazing Food, Perfect Ambiance","Not my first time visiting Etna but this place deserved to be recognised. I cannot say enough of its amazing selections of food - fresh and delightful. Always brings me back to the streets of Italy. Perfect ambience!

The staff is also attentive and extends great service. Especially Sharleen who never fails to pop a smile in her eyes (mask on of course) and recommends the best wines to pair with the food I ordered.

Can't wait to be back for their house specials.
Grazie mille Etna!"
Italian food at its best,"We went there for food and drinks and it was great. Food is fresh and the taste is pretty much authentic. Pasta is al dente as it should be and the pizza is just right, thin dough and has a nice taste of Italian herbs. The fish was amazing, rightly balanced. Not too much seasoning or garlic.
Service friendly and helpful. We will come again. As many times before we were not disappointed"
Great Italian option in the east,Amazing food and hospitality. Not your cheapest outfit but quality more than made up. The team was totally awesome making the visit memorable!
Love the food and also the ambient ! The service is good!,I truly enjoy the food here. Good portion that can satisfy my taste bud. The service is good with the staff being attentive and friendly. A good place to catch up with friends or family. Good range of food for selection.
"Good food, mediocre service","Firstly, the food is good, and I’d recommend the Grilled octopus, which remained moist while retaining a fresh flavour. The Chef special of Bread crumbed sea bass was also good, though portions were smallish.

The service both in front and kitchen leaves a lot to be desired. Polite but in-attentive, they took over 90 mins to finish serving the 6 entrees we ordered. It wasn’t really about the crowd, as three other tables (total of 12 people) had already left by time we got our last dish. It was as if they served the first 3 dishes ( in first 30 mins) …. Then dropped the receipt until we asked…

When we enquired about the delay, they simply said the dishes were being cooked in groups instead of in order…I.e. all the fish were cooked together…. All the lamb together…all the pasta together!?!? I’m not sure how Ramsey, Ferria or Pierre-White would have reacted to this answer.

First time there, never going back, despite the food."
Fantastic Set lunch,"Our 2 kids joined us for the set lunch at Etna Siglap
- the friendly and helpful staff upon noticing our 2 kids offered to switch dessert of the day (coffee pudding) to chocolate ice cream for the kids

They also accommodated our kids request for pizza vs calzone. When the kids could not finish the pizza, this was packed for them to take home."
Nice but super expensive food,"Ambience, service, & food are superb However I'm appalled by the price. For my mains I only got 6 ravioli and it cost ard $36 and I ate it within 5min."
The best you can get,"Celebrating my friend’s birthday there, we met the best ever floor manager who is so customer-centric. She took our order and recommended to increase variety and trim the portion. She even suggested we cancel one item along the way as she observed we would not be able to finish. She came to chat with us often and of gave my friend a birthday treat of gelato. What a delightful and joyous evening."
Not an expererience as it used to be,"Was waiting and being ignore by the waiters. Aircon wasn't working. Had to ask for the bread basket while other tables were offered. This used to be my favourite place and I had always enjoyed the dining experience. unfortunately it isnt the same anymore. Forget fine dining, it was below average in terms of customer service and food"
"Disappointing visit. Extremely average food, poor hospitality","We came here for a birthday celebration. Called in advance letting the staff know as well, they said ok no problem. We weren’t expecting over the top service, but every other restaurant I’ve been to for a birthday meal the staff will always either wish you a happy birthday, give you dessert, or both. So I thought the least Etna could do was to wish my sister a happy birthday knowing it was her birthday celebration. Birthday or not, the staff serving us definitely weren’t the warmest bunch.

Food was very mediocre. The cacio e Pepe is slightly below average. Not sure why I’ve seen reviews saying it’s the best authentic Italian food in town. Have been to Italy and have had authentic Italian food several times in my life and this place definitely falls short.

Still, my main concern is the neglectful hospitality. If you’re coming here after work with family for a quick 30 min eat with no expectation but to eat some pasta, maybe it’s not the worst. That said, it doesn’t taste delicious enough to justify a >$25 price tag for one pasta dish."
Pleasant dinner experience,Food is delicious and authentic. My son enjoyed the bread and the Umbricella pizza is amazing. Ambient is nice. Owner is very friendly. Price is reasonable.
First class from every point of view,"An unpretentious restaurant, but with very high quality food and excellent service. The staff were very knowledgeable."
Birthday dinner at ETNA,Had a pleasant experience. Food was excellent. Authentic Italian food as always at Etna. Will definitely dine here again.
Not the Etna I knew anymore,"Recent experience wasn’t the Etna I knew anymore. Hubby found oxtail stew special to be very tough and on top of that, found a piece of foil (looks like seasoning packaging) inside the stew when eating it. Gave this feedback to manager. He came back to say he has given feedback on how it can be cooked better. I told him what’s unacceptable is a piece of foil cooked inside the dish. He said sorry laughingly and started to walk away. I thought he was dismissive and avoidant, and asked him if he’s expecting us to pay for that carne special. He laughed and asked if we wanted dessert, we ordered a tiramisu. When he brought the bill he said he gave us a 20pc discount on the bill (when that wasn’t the case) and the tiramisu. We acknowledged the gesture and paid. When we got home and checked the bill details, the manager only gave the 20pc discount only on the oxtail stew, so we still paid for it! Well I guess we could hv checked the bill details at the restaurant, but given the manager’s dismissive and avoidant attitude towards service recovery, it wouldn’t hv mattered. Foil packaging (seasoning pack?) cooked inside stew, made to pay for it albeit with 20pc discount only on that dish, poor service recovery, not a good dining experience - and not the Etna of before anymore"
Best Authentic Italian,"This has been our second visit to Etna. Both times have been fantastic service, supreme food, and wonderfully simple atmosphere. Nothing is overdone for the sake of dramatics or pretentiousness."
Excellent Italian fare in a casual setting,"With the recent easing of tighter dining regulations, it seemed to be a good opportunity for my small group of dinner buddies to resume our regular get-together. We got to Etna early and, as the first group there, were allowed to choose our table - a nice one next to the window. Our host explained the daily specials, some of which were very tempting. The menu (which was accessed online via a QR code) was very diverse, and a table-sharing option seemed the best way to try as many of the dishes as possible. We eventually went with a couple of pasta dishes (topped with sea urchin and crab, respectively), grilled octopus on a bed of polenta, and a salami (very strong) pizza, before finishing with both a tiramisu and a chocolate dessert. Overall, a very satisfying experience fuelled by good food and a good atmosphere."
Authentic Italian,Authentic Italian food. Excellent service. Would recommend for sure . Vegetarian options available.. hidden treasure
Quintessential cosy Italian restaurant,Cosy nice Italian restaurant in a calm neighbourhood. Recommended for people who are fond of warm freshly baked breads and wines. Reasonable priced fancy restaurants. Ideal for romantic dates.
Gem in the east,"Nice food, massive portions, pleasant ambience. Friendly staff. Tasty wine. Recommended. Definitely worth a visit!"
Best Italian food in town,"Ambience, food and service was excellent. It felt really nice trying authentic Italian food with rich flavours!"
Great food and service,"Late night date night after the kids were asleep. Great service, lovely atmosphere and delicious pizzas!"
Amazing authentic Italian food!,"Wonderful experience - food was very authentic and delicious, yet with their own little differences - added with a cosy ambience and friendly staff. Big thumbs up!"
"Tasty Italian food and friendly, competent service.",Lovely service and the food was good and authentic. Definitely try the tiramisu with the pistachio paste - absolutely gorgeous. Staff were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Etna has a real community vibe to it. Loved it and we will be back.
"Great food, Great Value for Money","I have been going to Etna for a few times and I can confidently say that the food is consistently good. Etna is a mid-priced restaurant in a very cozy part of Upper East Coast Road. It is my go to Italian place in the East - no other restaurant comes close.The pasta is outstanding and I had tried quite a few - all were delicious. Service was always prompt and courteous. On the day that we went, they had a special - the Cotoletta ala Milanese. This is breaded veal and it was super tender and fried just right - comes close to the very good ones I have in Milan. Etna will remain my favourite Italian dig on the East for some time to come."
Great dining experience,We went for a family lunch outing at our neighborhood Etna at East Coast. Nice service. Waiter explained the day's specials very well and food turned out to be as good.
Perfect Little Local,"Our favourite BYO Italian restaurant in Singapore. The specials menu changes all the time and always has some absolute gems. Whether you are after something fancy for a special occasion or just a pizza and a quick pasta mid-week with a cheeky bottle of wine, Etna in East Coast is our pick."
birthday celebration for my kid,"Recommended by my colleague. The food and wine were good and we were pleased. However, there wern't any personal touch which I somehow expected. having wrote in the booking that it was my kid's birthday celebration and i actually verbally told the waitress(when we were there) that we can do with anything even a simple plate with a candle that would make my kid(9 yr) happy, we were told the next seating is 4mins away and we have to leave.. It's really sad and a bad taste. We didn't stinge on food or drinks, spent ~$80 per pax including my helper (3 adults and 3 young kids). I have been to so many Italian resturants in Singapore and the leasy we woud expect is lack of the hospitality. Anyway, there is always a first and I'll probably let my colleagues who recommended me this place know this is just any place to dine and no a frill place. Hey guys, fod is good here and forget about the rest or maybe it's just bad luck today ! :("
Excellent white truffles dinner,Excellent white truffles dinner in one of the best and authentic Italian restaurant of Singapore. Alessandro and his staff are always a guarantee.
Good Italian food that is not overpriced,"3 course set lunch was $33 per pax after service and tax. Caprese salad , tomato soup, dessert and coffee were good. Bread wasn’t great but that didn’t bother us. Staff were attentive though they could have smiled a bit more and looked less uptight ! Overall a good place to go for a quiet, satisfying lunch."
Incredible authentic pasta and Italian meat classics,Another great meal at this Italian hidden in the East Coast. It’s actually probably the best in Singapore for the food and service.
Overpriced and mediocre food with a housewine at 28 dollar per glass,"One half full glass of wine at 28 dollar, bland veal (supposed to be 300 gram which it was if you include the enormous amount of breaded crust...) bland sauce, mushroom sauce with only a few tiny pieces of mushroom, pasta from a pack... all very disappointing

I understand restaurants are having a hard time under the pandemic, but this way we'll never come back... what a deception at a simple meal for 160 dollar."
Italian Dinner at East Coast,"Came here to celebrate hubby’s birthday. We had burrata cheese with Parma ham and baked eggplant as appetizer. Both were good.
As for the mains we had glazed pork tenderloin, lasagna and Etna pizza. The pizza was too salty to our liking. The tiramisu and panna cotta
were great. Lady staff were friendly and helpful and service was good. Overall, the food is a little pricey."
Good food with good serve staffs,"Had a good dinner and a friendly staff, Akif. Food is good and well worth the money. Will definitely go back again."
Great,"Awesome, very good pizza and cheeses. Wine is a bit overpriced but overall amazing Italian food!!!!!"
Italian Evening,"Although it was a weekday evening, the restaurant was packed. Social distancing measures in place resulted in the place feeling rather cramped. Food quality, wine and service were superb although the food and wine was on the pricey side"
Super Service & Food To Match,"Super service & outstanding food! We love their grilled pork ribs best, succulent & tender pieces on a bed of baked potatoes. Parma pizza is thick yet crusty. The seafood stew is aromatic but is an acquired taste."
"Average food, poor service, expensive","Average food, poor service, expensive.
Service was very slow, with 2 items not turning up at all. Food was average, snapper was over cooked and not at all fresh, lobster ravioli was tasty but under seasoned. Desert was good, especially the tiramisu - it did take 35 mins to turn up after our mains were cleared.
Disappointing overall, and very expensive for the quality and service received."
Lovely italian restaurant,Enjoyed our dinner at this small and lovely italian restaurant. Good ambience and friendly waiters. Will definitely go back.
First visit and will return!!,We visited during busy weekend lunch. But the manager was attentive to all tables and made small talks. I was really sad that their special menu “white truffle pasta” was sold out but they offered alternatives which shows they know their menu. Pistachio ice cream is made by them and very satisfying. They also recommended the wines to go with our food. Its a casual dinning feel but top notch service!! Ill definitely recommend my friends and family!!
Excellent lamb and beef. Great service.,"We had a great dinner date at Etna. The ambience was great. Starters were great. Lamb was crispy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside. Heavenly. T bone steak was tender and juicy. And it was great to end off with a Tiramisu. Thanks for the great service as well!"
Pregnant woman yelled at by server,"I can’t even begin to describe the horrendous service that we just experienced at Etna, East Coast tonight (our reservation was at 730pm). My friends and I (8 people) were having our CNY dinner and drinks. One of my friends is pregnant and she politely asked a server at the start of the dinner if she could have the 2 non alcoholic beers that she had brought herself (she doesn’t drink soft drinks and water is boring). The server (a lady who speaks with an Indonesian accent) told her it was ok and even gave her a glass. The rest of us ordered wine (we had a total of 3 bottles of wine). As we were finishing our main courses, this other male server started to give my pregnant friend a hard time for drinking the non alcoholic beer. We explained to him the whole situation and that we had asked for and received permission from the other server. We were actually dumbfounded by the completely unprofessional manner he had spoken to us. It even seemed like he was threatening us when he told us that we were sitting right below the CCTV and that his ‘boss’ could see everything! Was that necessary? We weren’t even doing anything that could be remotely considered as illegal. To make matters worse, the lady server changed her story about how she thought my friend was just drinking a Sprite. The male server then retorted that “we serve Sprite here as well!” Obviously the festive mood was ruined. There are so many ways to say something and he had chose to be antagonistic, combative and in fact, he was downright accusatory. It made us really wonder; how much training do u provide to your staff? This is not just bad service; it’s disservice. We then asked to speak to the manager (Alex) who tried to perform some sort of service recovery. We told him how disappointed we were at the unprofessional manner his staff had behaved; first accusing the customers and changing her story just to be in a better light (complete lack of integrity). None of these servers apologised to my friend or us. Alex tried to but it seemed too little, too late. He offered “a free shot of limoncello” for everyone when we asked for the bill. We politely declined. To add insult to injury, the lady server asked us again, “are you sure you don’t want the free limoncello?” How insulting! We definitely will not be coming back to Etna. It doesn’t matter how good the food is because the service is appalling and dismal. Instead of the satisfaction and delight, we left the restaurant with a bad taste in our mouth."
"Another visit, another great meal",My family loves this restaurant and it’s the perfect go to chill. Last night I tried the risotto and it was excellent. The wines are interesting and reasonably priced which is becoming unusual in Singapore. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable
Great italian food,Good atmosphere and great food. Service was good with friendly waiters. Will definitely go again!!!!
One of the best Italian restaurant in Singapore,"I love burrata from starter. I always order burrata, never drop standard since I first visited here (maybe 8 years ago). Crab meat pasta is must try dish."
Authentic Italian cuisine,"Even for a weekday night, the place is relatively busy. We ordered their seared steak (Tagliata Manzo) and it was simply delicious. They recommended the Foca Special which is served like a thin slice of pizza but with cheese filling. A must try for sure."
Best Italian restaurant on the East Coast!,"Delicious Italian food! Im here almost every month and they are happy to accommodate my request to go off menu. I typically order a seafood pasta but their seafood stew is really good too. For appetisers, try the Bruschetta or Clams or mussels. The shellfish is always fresh here. I’m allergic to MSG so I’m always happy to find a restaurant that doesn’t use it in all of their dishes."
Great Italian Food,"Friendly staff who patiently explain abt the menu.. Great recommendations as we like it.
Serving great n authentic italian food. They even accomodate our special request of the way we want the risotto to be cook, which is of the menu. Will come back for sure."
"Amazing food - bad, bad service","We chose the restaurant because of good reviews and the other Etna restaurant... Ok good thing: food tastes really good, so kudos to the chef.

The rest you can get in any low cost restaurant... Help the servers with plates, pour your own water or wine, don't get clean cutlery... I don't know why they bother with white table clothes (we assumed that means better class/service).

So... if you are in a t-shirt, sport clothing (most clientele is like that) and want good tasting food while ignoring the service and pay premium - this is the place. For the rest... Plenty of other Italian options in Singapore."
"Great service, nice food","One of the better service staff I’ve encountered. Great job! Appreciate the advice on the portion of the food. Food is nice, won’t say wow yet but will go back to try other dishes."
Best Italian restaurant in East Coast,"We cam here for set lunch, which is really good value, and we like the fact they do change their menu regularly. We love their pizzas and the portions are regular .Service is good. Will definitely patronise again,"
Excellent 4 cheese pizza,The 4 cheese pizza was really excellent. I will definitely order it again. Family had the pasta and they really enjoyed it too. Restaurant is not too big so it’s good to place a reservation to make sure you get an indoor seating especially on a hot day. Staff are friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back to try more dishes. Price wish is slightly pricey but I feel it’s worth it.
Super Italian meal here and great service,Visited this great little Italian restaurant with friends from UK and they loved it. The service was very friendly and waiter was extremely helpful. There were also good vegetarian options. Would definitely recommended and visit again.
Etna @ Upper East Coast,"surprised to see the crowd on a weekday nite. but as we had made a reservation, we were quickly shown to our table. friendly service staff who are attentive to customers' needs. nice ambience. all the dishes we tried, taste heavenly and are all nicely presented :
appetizer - parma ham with burrata cheese, calamari with mashed potato
main - calamari risotto, classic cabonara, lasagna, Etna pizza
dessert - almond panna cotta, tiramisu, canoli"
Homely and friendly Italian restaurant,Food is yummy and servers are friendly. Always flexible in customizing the dishes you want. Cozy ambience is a bonus.
Excellent service!!,"I ordered wrongly but they were willing to give me the correct one that I wanted.

I thought I had ordered quarttro formaggi when I actually ordered another dish and they were willing to switch it for me.

Looking forward to come back again if I am looking for Italian food!"
Always a great meal,"Came with the kids (7 and 8) and we had a great meal with excellent service. My daughter puts their lasagna at Number 2 on her list (second only to mine!) and my son, who has eaten pizza all over the island, puts theirs at Number 2 as well, second only to his favourite sourdough crust pizza shop. I had the lobster ravioli which was delicious.
Service is great and the food is consistently delicious. Pricing is excellent compared to other places with poorer quality food but upmarket location."
The food and service here is THE BEST :),"We've eaten at Etna before and as always we have never been disappointed. The menu always has something new and delicious to try, while keeping old favourites that you want to keep on eating. The calamari starter we had with a chickpea sauce was amazing. So was the lamb shank, lobster ravioli and veal cutlet. Heads up the veal cutlet is such a giant portion you can share it with two people or you can bag your remainder and enjoy it later on, which we did. This is a restaurant where the staff treat you with genuine warmth and they're quick to suggest items, drinks etc to try. Five stars for this place!"
Not as good anymore...,Used to go for a fix when I needed my pizza and pasta when I am in the area. Visited them last November for a gathering and was not impressed. Decided to give a go again last evening but was greeted with smaller portion and pizza were not as good anymore.
Poor Service,"1. Service staff forgot to key in my orders. Customers that arrived later got their food served before us.

2. Other tables were served the complimentary bread, but not my table until I asked.

3. Service staff was not responsive. We had to try multiple times to get their attention."
Not as good as before,Still one of the better Italian restaurant in Singapore but standards of service and quality of food had dropped somewhat when I had lunch there on 1st May 2019. Although its likely due to the larger than normal lunchtime crowd you would expect standards to be maintained for the price that you paid.
Excellent customer service experience and fantastic meal,"We had an absolute terrific experience dining at Etna, enjoyed the tasty food so much! We love the freshness of the ingredients and materials, special tiramisu is a great takeaway!"
Birthday Dinner,"This restaurant was packed, so reservations are necessary. They have indoor and outdoor seating. The staff were very nice and efficient, but I think they could have used a couple more servers. The food was excellent. I had lobster ravioli which was delicious. My daughter had the pork tenderloin which was moist & tender. 3 of the teenage boys shared an enormous T-bone. Some of our party had pizza which they said was very good. We also had the Sicilian mixed seafood stew which was real good too. I would highly recommend this restaurant for authentic Italian food which is consistently good."
Yumz Dinner at Etna,"dinner and service was superb. always my go to place for italian food. I was early for my booking and the manager managed to sit me. No fuss, no questions asked! appreciate!"
Overrated n expensive Italian resto,"Will never come back again though highly recommended by my spore friends.
1. Had 3 kinds of Pasta but taste is plain
2. Fish dish is fairly good but small size
3. Starters are good, but small portions.
4. Risotto is decent.
5. Feel like using MSG.

Expensive given UCRoad location."
unpleasant dining experience,"Find the food nothing to shout about. Barely reaching average standard. Service is poor, with grumpy waiter pulling his face telling us he's got heavy tray to carry when we asked for a plate. Not a place to recommend for cozy dine in after a long day at work."
Homely italian,"A very fine restaurant, family-owned feel, good for families, couples, small groups.
Setting; 3/5
East Coast Road, Siglap, has a good vibe to it. There is a small outdoor section if the weather’s kind (cool) but indoor is pretty small and conversations are easily overheard as the tables are close.

Atmosphere; 3/5
Etna retains that small restaurant feel, family friendly but also welcoming for couples, which is nice to keep when so many outfits feel empty. It’s busy so where it can get annoying is from that open atmosphere. We had toddlers next to us on iPads with the sound right up in an effort to have them entertained while parents in sports kit enjoyed their evening dinner. Family dining is one thing but please Singapore pick your timing better.

Food and Bev; 5/5
Not Michelin star but gosh I like going to Etna, it has good simple pasta, a wine list that’s expansive but not totally outlandish and a specials board that’s always (ALWAYS) got a big steak and a whole fish on it.
So while the food is simple, you cannot go wrong with their ragu, the presentation is a touch above the competition, which makes a lot of difference to the experience.
And their tiramisu is killer!!!

Service; 4/5
I am torn on this and have the same feeling after a couple of visits. There are almost two teams on the floor; those who look after you for food and (I think) the family who look after you for wine. And the difference in engagement is massive. You get your food, fine, but you have a chat and an engagement while ordering wine.

Value/Price; 4/5
For an East Coast eatery it’s reasonable. I feel that if the service were to slip then the value for the total experience would not be there, but for me that feel of home and the personal attention you receive makes the price definitely affordable for regular eating as well special occasion."
Best Italian,We are there for Valentine's day with some friends. My raspberry infused tagliatelle pasta was just superb. My wife loved her lobster ravioli with the pistachio sauce. The deserts were Devine. Service was great especially for a packed Valentines day. We're hoping to stop back on our way back home. By the way this is Northern style Italian cooked with some butter. Enjoy.
Decent food/service but no value for money,"We saw the great reviews and had cravings for Italian food so thought about trying the place. The tables were very closely placed with almsot felt like sharing a table with everyone. The Ravioli aragosta (36 sgd) was decent, the Linguine granchio(28 sgd) was a dissapointment . It had no seasoning, little pieces of crab shells were found in the dish , basically no taste of crabs at all. The best dish was Margherite al pistachio (24 sgd) was finger licking good. My compliments to the chef. At last we decided to order another pizza and the server kept on asking if we really wanted a pizza and not a dessert. I found it really weird .Anyway i think its worth a one time visit ."
Decent restaurant,It was a good restaurant but the food portions were not big. Their service was good. Went with our grown up boys to celebrate the holiday season.
Good food and service,"We made reservation for 1230pm and arrived at 1215pm. Seating was prompt and drink order taken right away. Service was attentive throughout our meal and food tasted good. Free bread basket was quite nice too. Ribeye was our favorite, while tuna appetiser was just so so."
Great service but food quality inconsistent,"We were looking forward to celebrating my daughters' birthday at Etna on 23 Nov 2018 and the ambience and service didn't disappoint. However, for a $400 (including GST) meal for 5 pax, the food did not live up to expectations. The starters (Burrata, salads) were great but the clams and mussels in white wine sauce was overcooked. I mentioned to the serving staff when she cleared the plates but nothing was done. The flower crab pasta in tomato sauce tasted bland. The pizza with mozzarella cheese and salami had too much salami in it and was very salty. The risotto was good and so was the truffle paste pasta with mushrooms. Wine was also good. I was surprised,, however, that the 3 cups of peppermint tea we ordered was very light. There was no teabag in the glass when the tea was served to us. They had prepared it in the kitchen and served it. The tea could be stronger for a better mint taste. The restaurant was not full so there should be time to prepare 3 good cups of tea. The staffs at Etna did a great job and was friendly and attentive. but the food could be better, considering we had spent quite a bit of money there."
Authentic,Food portion was not too big. Authentic Italian. Good service! Great place to eat with family and friends.
Nice quiet location and good food!,The location is not ideal for tourists as it's located in the suburbs among housing area. The restaurant was doing roaring business when I was there but surprisingly the service remained good and attentive! The food was good and they had a reasonable selection of wines. Overall a bit pricey but was worth it!
Had a great time!,"Cosy place, great and fresh food. Loved the burrata, so creamy! Decided to dine at Etna for a birthday celebration today and the service was impeccable. We were directed to our seats almost immediately and did not have to wait long before appetisers were served. The birthday cake (I chose tiramisu) also came at the exact right timing without having to call for it. (cue attentive staff). The cake is highly recommended, we loved it. Everyone is warm and welcoming, great service. Would definitely head back again to try more of the menu."
Very Good Cantina in Singapore,An Italian host is always a good sign. A wooden oven a better one. An Italian chef even a better one.
Very good,"Looks like there's been a change in management. I have been going to Etna for some years but not recently..., But It seems like the seats in the restaurant have become very hard (not comfortable). Maybe its my imagination, or maybe the cushions have finally given up...

But anyway, the food is consistently good, and last night i have a simple spaghetti bolognese, and it tasted delicious."
Great Restaurant,"Went with family for dinner. The atmosphere is perfect and the place was full. We made reservation so it was no problem. The food menu has a wide variety from Pizza to great main dishes, such as lamb and pork. Desert are also great."
Excellent meal,"A business group I was working with set up a dinner for a large group at this restaurant. The food was excellent light Italian fare. The pasta was fresh. The salad was delicious. The eggplant was flavorful. They had a fine wine list. Overall, it was a pleasant restaurant for a business dinner."
"Simply delicious food, thank you and see you soon!","Etna Italian served delicious food and great service with warmth and sincerity.

Nothing fancy in their branding or writeup about their restaurant. But they simply cook amazing Italian food. They based most of the cuisines from Sicily and you will see that they make great effort in making each dish with extra mile.

- Eggplant parmigiana was great, not overly cheesy but just perfect. Light, rich and layered.
- Linguine granchio was also simply delicious. Not typical creamy base but more on tomato base with no cream. With crabmeat mixed into pasta but also with a body of the crab on it as well.
- Stracoto beef ribs was a yum. It was huge portions, beautifully cut and plated. It was such a joy to be there.
- Tiramisu Pistacchio was delicious too. It was more firm than most other soft tiramisu. The texture and balance of sweetness and lightness was harmonious. They even made white chocolate in spoon profile for you to eat.

These are what simply delicious food that owners and the team went into great length adding extra mile into each dish.

The waiters and waitresses were also just genuinely nice. It was such a joy and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This will be our place to go to near our home and we hope our families could grow up with this place.

Thank you Etna italian!"
Excellent!!!,We ordered salad for starters; Bruschetta al Pomodoro & salad. Truffle pizza & rib eye for mains. Panna Cotta and Chocolate Lava Cake with 2 glasses of red wine and 2 bottles of Acqua Panna and single espresso. Food is fantastic and can taste the authenticity of Italy. Service led by Alessandro n 1 Chinese and 1 Indian guy are great also. Thank you Etna for allowing me to score big!!!
Great Authentic Italian Food,"This is a great Resturant. The staff are passionate, knowledgeable clearly loves ng the food they serve. There were 3 of us and we sat outside it is a shame there’s no view it’s just street side,but the inside is really contemporary. We had a selection of dishes, pasta pizza and a couple of starters, all which were great.
I would highly recommend this place, there is another closer to the CBD both are excellent."
Impressive cuisine,"Every dish from appetizer to dessert, including coffee and wine, was perfect. Friendly and professional service. It's not cheap, but worth every penny."
Excellent Italian Restaurant,"Second dinner at Etna East Coast.
Surprisingly, server actually recognised us almost immediately.
We were on our way to catch a late flight and had dinner there on the way. They accommodated us with our 5 huge luggage in tow. Kept it safe in their store room while we dine.
Food is good. Pasta, cheeses, wine and liquor.
Service is good. Being nice and cosy, it doesn't take much effort to get service staff's attention.
Great location being near the airport to have a good dinner before the long flight out.
Special commendation to service staff for keeping their cool in the midst of a busy service night and knowing when to appear and when to disappear from the table."
Cosy Italian Restaurant,"Lovely joint to bring the family and friends. A little pricey but its worth it. Service is great. Always on hand if you need anything. Even a topping up of water. Its nice knowing that there's a nice Italian in the east side of Singapore without having to go into town.
The Lava cake is amazing! My only disappointment was the calamari- which was a little too chewy. Rest of the food was brilliant!"
Very good Italian restaurant with excellent service,"Second time at Etna-East Coast. This time the five of us came for a Sunday lunch. Service just as impeccable as the first time. The clam & mussels in wine and the burratta appetizers were great. So were the cappuccinos! Had two types of pastas, crab & squid, and two types of risottos, saffron and raspberry. You need an acquired taste to appreciate the raspberry risotto but the rest were delicious. For dessert we had pistachio ice-creams, tiramisu and Sicilian cake. We found the cake too sweet but the pistachio ice-creams and tiramisu was fantastic!

Best to make a reservation for weekends. Parking is a bit of a problem as there are no carparks nearby. The nearest public carpark is at least 300m away. Price wise on the high side but justified by the quality of food and service."
Lovely Cuisines ~ Lovely Staff,"I always love popping up to this Italian, as I am an Italian food fanatic. The pizza there is great; although a bit spicy for kids. The juice and wine there is good. I have only been there around three times and have only had the delicious pizza and spaghetti, but I would recommend here with the staff being lovely and I am sure you'll love the food,"
Good food. Horrendous service staff.,"Some context. Me and my girlfriend are 18 years old. We didn’t dress up well and we came here on two separate occassion。

We ordered the burrata cheese which was amazing.
The lobster ravioli was delicious and the prawns were perfectly cooked.
The lasagna first time round was delicious but the second time round was just mush and sour. Soft shell crab pasta was amazing as well.
The tiramisu is to die for. The cannoli could use a bit more flavour.

Food wise, It’s really good and pretty authentic.

Service wise, it’s horrendous. We were treated like rubbish either cause we don’t dress well or we are young. Other customers were treated significantly better. Was neglected throughout and the staff didn’t seem to want to serve us. We were nothing but pleasant since we ourselves worked as waiters. The vibe they give was genuinely off putting. Was disheartening because I really love and study Italian cuisine. To be treated like dirt twice is truly sad.

Left feeling disappointed. Come here for good food but don’t have high standards for the service staff. Y"
Good food. Fair portions.,"Was there with 2 customers. Shared two starters and two main course. Had individual portions of pasta. For 3 guys, it was a bit too much food. Starters was a cheese dish and a bruschetta dish. Both good. Pasta was good. Fish main course was OK. Pork main course was good. Was it down with some beer. Service was good. Parking is difficult in that area. Will go back for the pasta dish."
Pleasant surprise,"The place had a good vibe during Saturday evening when we visited for dinner. We ordered some Mediterranean Salad, calzone, and some wine. The taste was pleasantly nice, would go again if I have an Italian food craving to fix next time."
