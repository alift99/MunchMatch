Hard Upselling,"I was here for a business dinner. These guys were just trying their hardest to upsell me on everything. The experience was not good at all. While the food was really decent, this hard-sell approach left a distinctly bad taste in the mouth that definitely comprised my enjoyment of the food. Stop trying to recommend the most expensive items on (and off, especially off) the menu and you will get more repeat customers, I assure you. Not going back again."
The First Wow Restaurant to Hit Singapore in Years,"Simone Fraternali is a revolutionary chef to hit Singapore. He’s ingenuity to the culinary art is breathtaking. Take for instance the burratina and fichi which is the classic starter but the carmelized fig takes the dish to a whole new level. Similarly, the polpo with the candies cherry tomatoes is divine which brings out the braised and grilled octopus like I have not had in Singapore in years. The pasta, too, are unique and scrumptious. Take the spaghetti all’s chitarra is a wonderful variation of crab aglio olio with crisp, bread crumbs that change the complexity and texture of the dish.

Aside from the food, the wine list is solid but not extensive. It is, however, we’ll priced for Singapore. And most importantly, the hostess and staff are exceptional. The are attentive, welcoming and looking to provide a complete dining experience.

Bravo!"
Italian home restaurant,"It was my first time trying this beautiful restaurant, the food was superb, will more likely to come here often.the place was so warming staffs are so welcoming"
Salty Food,"Firstly, do not order their pasta. We ordered the spaghetti alla chitarra. It was very salty. Then we informed the waitress about it, and it turns out the waitress said the spaghetti was meant to be like this.

Hello now salt very cheap?!

Then is the zuppa d'astice soup. That is a super awful lobster bisque ever.

Last, paid bill times, gave me next table bill."
Next level on Amoy Street,"What a place - we went twice within a week! The first with some colleagues and the second for a great date night - both were fantastic. From the minute you arrive and Angela’s front of house team welcome you the magic unfurls……. The seating is very comfortable across two rooms and a chefs table style bar. Most seats give you a great vantage point to see Chef Simone at the pass ensuring endless quality and consistency. The food here balances ‘wow’ with restraint - ensuring the hero’s of the dish shine and the sides provide solid backing….think Frankie Valli and all the four seasons. Great examples are the pork ragu with perfect pasta, flavours singing with the soft ragu. The perfectly seasoned lamb cutlets with just the right amount of crispy fat playing the pink middle; the crab pasta…..the melt in your mouth octopus I could go on. A modern take on the classic Italian - with a fine wine list and great hosting - what’s not to like. A special place !"
Noisy and service hiccups,"The place is incredibly noisy, making it hard even to talk, mostly is there is a 6ppl celebrating close to your table. Service had several hiccups, not being able to serve all of our 4 dishes together, nor once (for the main the 4th has waited over 10’ after the others). Food is acceptable, but not absolutely impressive, and my sea urchin pasta has arrived cold. Price acceptable (for Singapore)."
Delicious food,"The food was very delicious. A pity the experience was dampen as there were a group of diners who were rather boisterous. As the restaurant is rather small & enclosed, the noise was too much to bear as we could hardly hear one another speak. Being a Friday night, our dinner was delayed by 1h 45 mins. The service staff tried to help to their best ability and ended our meal with a sweet dessert. The food quality deserves the price it is asking but the atmosphere and turn of events that day really ruined it. If you are looking for a cosy romantic dinner date , do check in on their bookings for the night to avoid the crowd or longer dinner waiting time."
BRILLIANT ITALIAN FOOD,"Visiting Singapore on holidays, my wife found this restaurant and neither of us were disappointed. Both the food and service were brilliant. The food in particular was amazing. Both of the main courses we selected were outstanding. This restaurant is highly recommended and is not overly expensive."
Exquisite Italian Cuisines,"Situated in a charming restored shophouse in Chinatown. Wonderful service and food which includes lobster bisque, panfried foie gras, followed by the best baked eggplant “alla parmigiana”. The mains were equally excellent- marinated lamb rack and Iberico pork sirloin. Finished with differently prepared tiramisu and yuzu sorbet. Total cost plus a bottle of wine and 2 glasses of aperitifs is S$396."
Delicious food in CBD,"We visited recently for a late lunch and enjoyed the food immensely. Each dish was delicious and fresh and beautifully put together. The lunch set is very good value.
My selection included scallops, pesto pasta and cassatta. Special mention about the scallops being perfect, though i loved all the food served. My friend ordered the tiramisu, which was one of the best we've had around town.
Generous portions for everything.

I have taken away a star for service because one lady server was rude in interacting with us and in a rush to clear dishes before we finished. But the rest of the crew were fabulous and super courteous and made our lunch pleasant and enjoyable.

Special shout out to Solo for not rushing us out at 230pm. They let us sit and chat for an extra 15-20mins which was great Will definitely visit again."
Food,"1.Both goose liver are excellent that really melt in the mouth. Good flavor and combination.
2. Medium done lamb rack was disappointed. Requested to have fats attached and have to add $3 for the fats. But the 4 pcs of lamb turns out to be very lean and no visible fats.
3.Pappardelle Pork was excellent both in taste and texture.
4. Tiramisu is average and the lava cake is good."
Excellent service and great food,Casual Italian food with great service. Don’t sit in the back room - it has no windows and is dark. Could do with a facelift and better design.
Top Notch…service and quality…..,"Chef Simone and his team make the dining experience memorable every single visit.

The friendly and warm atmosphere created by the service staff and deco is super, recommended for Couples , families and even private events in their private room.

I definitely recommend Solo for the outstanding service and quality of food.

We definitely will come back to enjoy the Solo family"
average experience,"Very average restaurant, very noisy. The lunch set is suite varied but you have to add depending on the choice (+8 or $12!!!), it loses the interest of a set and the waiter spilled a bottle of red wine!!!"
Fantastic fine dining set,I found this delightful resturant through a recommendation. It was a perfect Italian set that did not leave me feeling heavy. A tour of flavors and friendly staff. Qiara was fantastic and offered suggestions on wine and helpful input. Please request her as she was key to my experience. The Uni pasta with tarragon was my favorite dish.
Great Italian food!,A nice medium sized Italian restaurant that serves delicious italian dishes. We had our seat in a private section (shared with 2 other groups) and apparently they celebrated their birthdays too. The service was good and efficient. I would go back to the restaurant again.
Lovely evening,"An absolute gem of a restaurant with fabulous food, great service and a lovely ambience. One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore!"
Good quality & service,"The food are of very good quality, fine dining standard, the service is excellent too especially by the restaurant manager Mr Freddy Lim"
Solo Review,Fantastic service and food. Pleasure to also meet the Chef Simone and Freddy. Highly recommend. Will be back.
Great food marred by condescending service,"Communication and staff attitude can be further enhanced.I have made a reservation under Chope and asked if the obligatory set menu is referring to the $36 and $48 festive menu set as indicated in their website. I received no reply, and was informed on arrival day that they only serve $128 special set, with the excuse that 31st Dec is a public holiday? We then went for alacarte, and upon realising that we are not ordering appetisers, the waitress who took all our 3 mains order, repeated again to ask what are we ordering for the day. Extra condescending. The food by Chef Simone was really good (5 stars) the last we came, and we understand that the F&B industry is really struggling due to the pandemic, hence my raved recommendation to friends & business clients, and to bring them over to try the food at Solo.
However, this experience shows you that besides the cooking from the chef, everyone plays a role in keeping a business alive, and when one shows no sincerity nor humility, it’s difficult to keep your customers for long; especially when the F&B business is so competitive."
New year dinner,We were a little disappointed that we didn't obtain a seat in side. And the cake that we bought over was missing 1 box after ask the restaurant to help chilled it
"Beautiful, beautiful!","Cozy atmosphere, we sat at the bar watching Chef Simone and his team prep the lunch courses while engaging in a bit of conversation about Rimini (where he’s from) and which football team he supported (AC Milan for the record ). Good was beautiful and elegantly presented, wine reasonably priced. Will certainly go back again."
Decent food and service at a high price,"Listed pasta was out of stock, but menu was not updated. Staff did not inform guest, even upon serving the dish with a substitute. This aside, portions and quality of food were not commensurate with the price. Would not return regularly."
Cute little place!,"Always love coming back to this little place. Foods great, service impeccable and meets formal dining expectations without being stuffy."
OUTSTANDING experience by Chef/Owner Simone,"Quality of food and service is unmatched.

The staff truly care about your experience, special thanks to Owner/ Chef Simone and his wife Angela, for the hospitality showed during our visit.

I want you to know how much we appreciated your excellent service you provided.

Your attention to details, great communication skills and ready smile made our experience unique and even better than I expected

Cozy and location was warm and lovely

High recommended I will definitely come back"
Second visit just as impressive,"After a fabulous meal several months ago wit my husband, I decided it was time to return to Solo with a friend, after they updated their menu recently. It was an excellent decision, and we had a fantastic evening!

We dined on a Tuesday, arriving for an early dinner just as they opened, and I was warmly greeted by name by several employees, including the chef in the open kitchen, and thanked for my return visit by the lovely hostess who remembered me from my last visit. The service remained attentive and friendly throughout the night.

And the food was once again fantastic. We both tried the new stracciatella bite, with candied tomato on toast, and for such a small and seemingly simple dish it was absolutely packed with flavour. I should have ordered two. We also shared two past dishes, the gnocchi with butternut and parmigiano reggiano, saba sauce and hazelnuts, and the porcini and potato tortelli with parma ham emulsion and crispy prosciutto. Both were excellent, the gnocchi was soft and the hazelnuts added a nice textural contrast, but the standout was the tortelli, it was exceptional. The texture of the pasta was perfect, the filling was sublime and the flavour in the sauce was incredible! It was salty, creamy and rich, but not over the top in any sense, perfectly balanced. One of my favourite pasta dishes in recent memory. Dessert was equally fabulous, the apple tart with almond crumble and vanilla chantilly was so good. I wasn't going to order it as I find these can be quite boring, but this one definitely was not, it was full of cinnamon flavour and the almond crumble was divine.

This dinner was a good reminder of why I need to visit Solo more regularly in the future!"
"Great food, great setting",We had the 5 course set menu. It was very reasonably priced and each course (we tried both the lamb and cod main courses and shared) was excellent - beautifully presented and lovely flavours. They did not skimp on the black truffles that were on two of the dishes.
Great come back !,"superb set lunch w creativity, taste, kindness for a very reasonable price. So happy they made it through Covid. Well done to the team. We feel passion in their dishes."
Birthday Celebration.,"Best Italian food in SG!
Hands down best pasta. From appetiser to mains and dessert. Very well crafted and the ambience feels very warm. Italy vibes. Chef was really nice as well, came out to greet and take photo with us. Will recommend! Wallet friendly, quality and affordable."
A decent dining area for the majority tasters but not the picky ones,"I chanced upon this restaurant from the reviews of the different food bloggers or tasters, and went to gave it a short for a special occasion with a friend of mine. When I was there, we were greeted by the service crew who somehow does not fit in to this casual fine dining ambience, not only was he unfriendly, he was unprofessional, my friend was wondering if we were really in the correct place. Despite the argument we went in any way, we were given a good seating but it was near the toilet. The waiter asked if we need any drinks, apparently my friend and I wasn't there to drink but to savor the dishes the well reviewed meal courses there so we ask for regular water instead, the only look we received was a look of disdain which made my friend and I uncomfortable. Skipping to the dishes, my friend ordered 3 course meal while I ordered a 5 course meal. To cut it short everything was up to standard and to our satisfactory as a casual fine dining restaurant, but the soup was not tasty enough and a little bland or watery and not worth mentioning for picky eaters. The cod fish on the other hand was not fresh as it had a fishy smell not to mention the desserts we had have no impact. Overall, there were hits and miss. It is a highly reviewed restaurant but it wouldn't be something we would often visit. Perhaps the a la carte selection would be better off. Also we highly recommend that the restaurant should focus on their service crew, to be more friendly and professional not to mention presentable in this setup of a restaurant, it is still in the area of fine dining right?"
OTTIMO !,"Lovely dinner ! Exceptional service. The starters are great just reading them makes you hungry. The beef tartare is amazing & spicy, also the main dish the polipo was perfect and sides tomatoes were really good !! i was looking for a cheese platter and was amazed by this wonderful cheese platter, so good! also the wine was excellent, Grazie mille Chef Simone !!! Thanks for the gorgonzola con tartufo so gooood!"
The Best Rigatoni Ever in My Life,"I’m 62 years old and an adorer of high class Italian cuisine - today, I had the best pasta of my life ever as a component of Solo’s lunch set menu: let me put it this way: these rigatoni were in a class of there own. The other courses and the wine were great, too; the waiter nice and well informed, happy to share his knowledge of the courses, the ingredients and the preparations. A great place for high class fine Italian dining.
We will come back!"
Wonderful gastro experience,"Great ambience, lovely food and service standards. Really enjoyed the overall experience. Will soon come back to try other dishes."
Underrated Italian,"Under the radar Italian restaurant, curated menu with well thought out specials. Reasonable price point. Good cooking techniques, for example pastas, octopus. Impressive flavours compared to bigger name restaurants (who seem more focused on dish appearances, seeking influencers). Outstanding and personalised service, small and meaningful touches like remembering diners, addressing by name. Keep it up chef Simone and team."
excellent,"excellent food, service, drinks, ambience, location, quality, reasonable price, will be coming back again"
Delicious food.,Delicious food. It’s casual fine dining. Sat at the bar counter and watched many of the dishes being prepared. Will be back.
Great food at reasonable prices,Great food without the expensive price tag! The portions were just right and service staff were attentive but never intrusive
"Good food, good ambience",Happy with the food in the set lunch menu. There were good choices to choose from. The portions were just right.
Superb Italian in Singapore,"This is a gem for Italian food lovers. Once again on Amoy Street. Friendly staff, The Chef Simone, goes from table to table to have a word with the guests. And the food.... absolutely perfect. We shared the wagyu carpaccio and burrata cheese with ham and tomatoes, I then had cod fish while my friend had vegetarian ravioli. We ended the meal with a fresh lemon tart. Everything, including the wine, was top notch."
Unfortunately below expectations,"Average - starts we’re ok but mains were average. Plates taken away whilst I was still chewing, fork in hand!"
Everything is Fantastic!,"Solo is my absolute favourite restaurant ! Last 6 months, been there 4 times with my friends. The food is always fantastic no matter what we ordered each time. Simply love the Iberico pork with onion and vegetables and ravioli with pesto and burratina to mention a few. If you are not sure what to order, Chef Simone is always happy to recommend. His recommendations never fails to delight us. Service is equally great. Very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable staff."
One of our best Italian meals in Singapore!,"My husband and I had dinner here earlier this month and were so impressed with the food. We absolutely loved each and every dish, it was a flawless meal. We shared the eggplant parmigiana to start, which is not something I normally order because it can be somewhat boring, but I'd read some reviews on this one so had to try it, and it was exceptional, packed full of flavour and brimming with gooey cheese, but not too rich or overly filling. We each had a pasta dish next, and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his gnocchi bolognese, but my pappardelle with pork ragout was a standout. The pork belly was meltingly tender, the sauce was smooth and rich and flavourful, and the pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente. It is one of the best pasta dishes I've had in recent memory, to be honest. We followed this with the guinea fowl, which is something we've only tried a couple of times, and this one was perfectly cooked, tender and well-seasoned. Desserts were equally divine, the lemon tart nicely balanced with the white chocolate and complimented with a very well-executed pastry crust, and the chocolate coconut lava cake, which was elevated from a typical lava cake by the deep, dark chocolate with just a hint of coconut, and the delicious accompanying toffee sauce and crumble.

We were seated at the counter which was a great experience. There's enough space between diners and the the chefs so that you don't feel too close, but can clearly watch the cooking and plating going on. Chef Fraternali was working and took the time to talk with us and ask about our enjoyment of the dishes, and it was great to be able to give him feedback directly on how much we loved each dish. Unfortunately the service was a bit inconsistent. The lovely woman working at the front door (hostess or floor manager perhaps?) was warm and friendly and welcoming, but our server, an older gentleman, was quite the opposite, and not particularly attentive either, leaving us with dirty plates for quite an extended period of time and not returning to offer us dessert, so we ended up flagging down a different server to place that order. But the quality of the food and the rest of the evening was such that it I still give a 5-star rating.

Truly spectacular food, and I see they also do brunch, so can't wait to return to try that and whatever new offerings they have in the new year."
Authentic Italian food and wine affair!,"Love everything in the menu. The Iberico pork chop and striploin steak we ordered in a few visits, were always cooked in perfection. Once ordered a turbot for a special event and it was the best I ever had - juicy and tender! Not forgetting also the uni pasta that makes you crave for more.

Solo also carries an extensive range of Italian wine that pairs perfectly with the well curated menu. I highly recommend the Legit Cabernet Sauvignon 2013, one of our must-have in every visit!

Always my top choice for a hearty Italian meal!"
Lovely place! Great food and wines,"Food was amazing! Well executed with variations and not the usuals! Had their special appetisers, my favourite cold angel hair pasta with Hokkaido scallops & their tagliolini Uni pasta and this plate of Iberico pork chop that was cooked to perfection and blown us away. Usually pork gets pretty easy to overcook somewhere somewhat but the chefs did it so well!

Price point is reasonable and is definitely not overpriced for what they’re offering and the comfort of the restaurant with friendly service.

Kudos to Chef Simone & his team!"
"Poor service, ventilation and expensive","Air Ventilation was so bad that our eyes became weary and teary after an hour of dining; service was poor as the restaurant was tellingly under-staffed. More annoyingly and importantly, food was expensive, portions were smallish, and did not taste as good as they appeared - great for IG, bad for tastebuds."
Real gem to find this Italian food!,"Quite speechless to described some of the food creation. Excellent food and presentation with top notch service .. one of my best place to eat Italian food in Singapore. The grilled Guinean chicken was out of the world, the grilled mushroom with mashed potatoes beyond explanation .. right texture with balance of saltiness ! The pan fried foie gras and white truffle mushroom made the highlight tonight. The Spanish shrimp bisque was really well done.. I just loved it. The uni pasta kind of average with well cooked pasta and the special sauce ! Great night with good selection of wines too. The service is attentive and friendly. Very cosy ambience and great to hang out with friend! Look for the friendly chef Simone and he can make you special of the day!"
Burratina and Branzino are the Winners!,"Reservation was done by my partner at 530pm. But when I checked online it was opened at 6pm so I assume is another clueless booking by my partner. We turn up at 545pm and they were indeed open! But the list of reservation doesn't have our name. Only 1 name looks closest as name has an addition I and table for 2. So that must be us! Ushered to section where air con was going way too strong. We said is too cold, can we've another seat? Took a while and asked us what time we're leaving, we've told them few times we WILL leave by 730pm. Found a table where room temperature is perfect, then before we can seat down, another server came and said no! Did we've a reservation? I said yes. He looked worried and go through his list of reservation name again. Another minute said ok the last table in the room. We said fine. Just when we sat down, ANOTHER server (a Malay guy in white top) came and asked us did we've a reservation? and he'll need the table back by blah blah blah. I almost lost it but because my partner is such a nice and patient person he reply.

Anyway, our server Albert made it up quickly and was very attentive. We didn't notice our table is unstable but he made sure he sort it out. Food was excellent! We had ala Carte and they've Gluten Free pasta. Burratina was superb. My thinly slice fish starter (Branzino) is so good. I can't rave about the GF pasta Tagliatalle Crab. The pasta texture is not so nice and taste dry. We ended with 36 hr slow cook Beef Cheek which is done to perfection.

Selection of wine by the glass for White is poor. Their recommended Chardonnay is not to my liking. I switched to Amarone which is SGD 25/glass. Is better. Overall ambience is nice, service and food are superb. However, only 1 unisex toilet. The price is reasonable. I'll be back again but I'll ensure I do the booking and specify the section to be seated without freezing."
"Amazing service, food and ambience!","Love the whole experience, was welcomed very warmly. Food was amazing from Chef Simone and team and they recommended amazing wine. Service by hostess and whole service crew was 5-star. Will keep returning!"
Amazing Italian food & desserts,"An awesome find in the city for amazing Italian cuisine. Great food & cosy ambience to spend the day with friends , family or loved ones. Their tiramisu is delicious; melts in your mouth. Another must try is their cheese platter. On both visits; dining in Solo brings us back to Italy. Reservations is a must as the place is always full!"
Food and service are superb!,Food and service are superb! Wine are of good quality too. Chef and Angela are friendly and warm. Cosy atmosphere for couples or friends gathering.
Great food but not that great service,"3.5 - Good food although portion sizes are especially small for the appetisers for the prices. Portions for the mains are quite standard. If you're looking to use the 25% off for entertainer, it only applies to appetisers.

We ordered the wagyu tartare & white truffles (fantastic), baked eggplant (really good as well), pork pappardelle (decent), pork chop (good) and the tiramisu (average).

Service from the the chefs was great but rather lacking from the ground staff - shown to a table despite booking counter seating, wine glasses weren't cleaned properly, had to ask 3 times for them to open and decant my bottle, we were served the wrong cocktail by a rather hassled looking waiter etc.

Overall still a pretty good dinner out and I'd certainly return for the appetisers."
"Over rated, food and service not up to standard","Ordered set lunch and glass of red wine.

- They served prosecco instead, since I ordered pasta and didnt seem to get any service, so forget it.
- usually will be served bread, but none for our table. We had to ask for it after appetizer as the main course took forever. Bread was cold..
- STROZZAPRETI, pasta , noodles are uneven and very thick, tasted like udon... nothing fantastic
- Tiramisu, too much sponge fingers, probably took up half cup, and did not soaked properly, chewy..
- overall service was poor, as though we owed them money upon payment. We didn't even complain about being served wrong wine, slow service nor the quality of the food."
"Good food, but the customer service is a let down","We went to Solo Ristorane for dinner after reading good reviews. The food was really lovely and there is a good selection. Sadly the customer service experience was a real let down. They must have been understaffed because it did not have a fine dining vibe at all. The waiter was rushed, and because we were seated next to the kitchen/service area we got the full blast of confused conversations and discussions between staff."
Awesome place,"What a great place. From the moment you walk in you are made to feel so special. The team, Mira, Yusuuf, Albert and Angela can’t do enough to make the visit special and the food that Chef Simone and Chef Flo concoct is beyond mouthwatering. I have my favorite but that includes just about everything on the menu. Honestly can’t say enough positive things about this place, it can be intimate in the ‘wine cellar’ area or super social at the bar watching the Chef’s work their magic. Great vibe, great food and wine and an awesome team. Has to be my favorite place in Singapore!"
Outstanding,"Unforgettable dining experience!

Best authentic Italian food in town

Went for dinner with friends the food was extremely fresh and tasty most of the dishes are homemade from a talent Italian Chef.

Outstanding and polite service.

Highly recommended, we will definitely come back.

Bravo Chef Simone"
"Surprising experience, with great food","Brought my family to dine, cos it's my mom's bday. The menu had no pics so its it was a little stressful to choose the dishes as we can't understand the words on the menu. So I checked their Instagram and trip advisor pictures but it's all outdated menu. They recently changed their menu in jun 2020. So we just have to guess what it was.
The food turned out amazing - I particularly loved the Seabass and
Burratina, it was worth the money and they are on Entertainer. My family loved it. The staffs were really friendly and they wished my mom happy bday on a card."
It was so much more than a dinner experience 😋,"Would highly recommend to visit this place for superb italian dinning experience! A cosy dining place to bring partners or friends over for dinner and drinks throughout the night. Chef Simone and the staff are courteous and friendly, so don’t hesitate to ask them for any recommendation of food and wines on your first dining with them! We sat at the counter bar and ordered a bottle of white, some items on their daily special menu. We also tried their traditional tiramisu and it’s definitely a must try dessert to complete the dinner! Be prepared to receive a shot of Limoncello on the house before you leave the place!"
Nice relaxed dinner,Went for the first time to this place and had a great experience: - Very good Italian food - Excellent & friendly service - Nice ambiance Will go there again soon and can only recommend.
Dissapointing experience,"We felt dissapointed at Solo Ristorante. Food tastes average, portions are minimalist and price is as expensive as an allegedly italian fine restaurant can be. Not a good experience."
Great Italian food!,"While I was in Singapore for Business I was craving for some Italian food.
A few people told me about this restaurant so I decided to give it a try.
What a great experience!!!
The staff was very professional, welcoming and fast.
“Alessandro” helped me with the menu and he choose for me a delicious red Italian wine, the Chef “Olindo” cooked an incredible dish (tagliatelle with squid ink and seafood), with his southern humor and jokes I felt at home!
I will definitely come back!"
Absolutely fantastic experience!!!,"The chef Oli is absolutely outstanding!
I sat at the bar counter, together with my girl friend and he has been so welcoming! We honestly felt like beeing in Italy or in my best friends place!
The kitchen is open so u get the full experience of how the dishes are prepared. Everything is homemade and fresh! Stunning!!!
ALEX the floor manager is absolutely amazing as well! He made a great wine recommendation and his service is out of this world!
If u look for a restaurant in which u feel like ""in a friend's place""... Well... that's the place to be. It's not because of the food and Beverages (well of course it plays an important role but..) it's because of the people (Oli, Alex and Florita as well) who makes this place so outstanding and makes u feel special and like a friend!
We will be definitely come back!!!

Thank you so much for an amazing evening!"
Best vibe and most amazing food in town,"Work nearby and come into Solo. This hidden restaurant is such a gem. Amazing food, so much fun with Orlindo with his hospitality and humour. He made our night! Really enjoyed the vibes here. So do the other guests tonight! Will come back for lunch meal as well with my colleagues Highly recommended!"
Birthday dinner,"One of the best Italian restaurants I have been to, both in Italy and in Singapore. Service was attentive and impeccable. The duck breast was something special. Highly recommend if you want a special night to impress someone."
Good food and nice atmosphere,"My boyfriend and I went to Solo for the first time last week. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was excellent. The menu is quite diverse and qualitative. The food tasted great and portions are quite big. Our only disappointment was the chocolate fondant, which was not special enough to justify the 15$"
One of the best in Singapore,Review wont describe how cool is this place. Go and check it out!! I use to come here often and they always have a new specialities!!
Amazing service,"We arrived late , the kitchen was just closed and cleaned but they accommodated us! They cooked us a beautiful vegetarian risotto while entertaining us with a big smile! I fully recommend Solo for an authentic Italian experience."
Authentic and Cozy Italian restaurant,"I ve been at Solo last week with a friend and the food was great , the egg with fresh shave truffle was superb . Amazing spot in a beautiful and busy street of Singapore"
Real italian food!!!,"What great night!!!!from the service to the food!!!the manager is was just fantastic,looking after us all night and also the chef just amazing!!!he came to the table to know if everithing was ok and he spoke a little bit about himself.the food was just perfecty cooked and it remind me when i was in italy for my vacation!!!the staff is almost all italians and i really loved that!!!pure italian gem here in singapur!!!i will see you soon guys!!!thank you!!!"
Amazing Italian food experience!,"Truly great italian food definitely one of the best in Singapore!

Good value for money and cherry on the cake Olindo the chef!! Will be back soon :-)"
Special Night at Solo,"Been here for the first time for my girlfriend birthday and we thought to try Solo Restaurant this time.
Since we arrived we had a really warm welcome and we really felt like going back to Italy and that was already a great start of the night.Following the night we ordered couple starter to share and as main we ordered the homemade Tortelloni and we had a nice bottle of red wine.Everything was just perfect and the Chef organised a little Tiramisu with a candle and we really appreciated that.A night to remember and I m sure we ll go back again soon.Thank you again."
Amazing food n service,"Went during dinner, me and my girlfriend was happy n love the food and service. Will definitely come back here with more friends!"
Amazing Evening!!!,"Just heard about Solo Restaurant from some of our freinds which they have dining here few times and always talk really about it .So we thought to give it a try....
We both went for the degustation menu and i wont never retreat that choice!!We started with the grilled octopus ,king prawn tortelloni and grilled salmon and to finish a great dessert .The pasta dish definitely won but overall evening was amazing.Well done to all of you and i will see you again soon.Great job........"
Dinner for 2.... Delicious,"Whilst on holiday! We came across Solo Ristorante and we it was such an amazing experience! The staff were friendly, with great service! My compliments the chef for our dinner and it was pleasure that I got thank
him personally! Great overall experience!"
Food poisoning,"Me & my friend had the same dish - prawn tortellini! We got so sick that night, that me personally thought I was going to die! My friend called them next day & that just apologised. The poisoning was not cheap either!"
MUST TRY!,"Italian Chefs Florinda and Ollie are simply the best in town. Solo's food is simply delish, creative and a must-try. I am a regular at Solo and you will not be disappointed. The food is absolutely amazing and every bite is happiness. The chefs are very passionate about their food and are lovely people to talk to. Solo is a place you should definitely try and you will not be disappointed."
Great food and ambiance,"Food is great but as the crowd get more the wait time gets longer.

We ordered warm chocolate cake right from the start of the dinner, i'm not sure why do they have to wait till we finished our meal then start to prepare the cake and made us wait another 20 mins.

Another point to mention is that we had a small argument with a female Chinese waitress. It's my birthday and hence i was given a free tiramisu. I didn't know about this arrangement hence we wanted to ordered 1 more but after her clarification I explained to her more than 1 time I only wanted 1 tiramisu which is the complimentary one. However, in the end she still brought 2 over, i explained to her again I only wanted 1. Instead of just putting the tiramisu back to the fridge ( it's served inside a glass bottle right from the fridge), she kept arguing with me saying that she had explained to me I ordered 2. We got frustrated arguing with her and told her to leave the extra tiramisu down and she told us she would cancel it. Not sure why she had to argue when it's something so simple like putting it back to the fridge.

Oh well, she totally spoiled the dinner and it ended off not so nicely."
Love this place,"Amazing food, fantastic chefs great alcohol and the best Italian food in Singapore. This place is unbeatable. Highly recommended"
Best Italian restaurant in Singapore so far.,"I’ve been to Singapore quite a few times and, as an Italian living in Asia for many years, i’m always looking to find restaurants where I can eat the real Italian food.
So I went trough TripAdvisor, found Solo restaurant and decided to give it a try.
It was quite an experience!
First of all I really loved the open kitchen, chef Olindo prepared my dinner right in front of me and I absolutely liked the care and attention he has even for small details.
The food tasted amazing, the meat was perfectly cooked and tasty, and I really liked the carpaccio with truffle on top.
Another note, this restaurant is really classy and I really like the interiors.
I can definitely recommended Solo restaurant if you want a real Italian taste in Singapore!"
"Amazing cuisine, savoring each bite","We filled up on a series of appetizer, pasta and a Risotto el Peppe. Olindo Donadio, presents with an Italian flare the best of Italy in each dish. Ours included Uovo Alla Piemontese, an unexpectedly delightful presentation of black truffles; Barrata E Proscuitta, where Andria Burrata Cheese is topped with Parma Ham and... wow; Polipo, patate e paprika- grilled octopus that melts in your mouth with the creamed sweet potato; and the tagliatelle, tortellini dishes. The Risotto was the best I've had anywhere, and fills, allowing savoring of the delectable, smaller other dishes. The Tuscany wine was a great compliment. Congrats to Olindo for an outstanding presentation and meal."
"The best Chef's in Singapore, Olindo Donadio!",Great foods prepared by Chef. Easily one of the best Italian restaurant in Singapore! Totally worth it!
Mr,The food here was amazing i don't normally leave reviews but I've left 2 in my time here!! Thoroughly recommend eating at this gem :) Spoke with Olindo following this who was the master who put these plates together amazing thanks again guys x
Real italian taste!,"Have to chance to eat here a couple of times. It is in Amoy street, Chinatown. Both times was outstanding, you can find the best seasonal dish and wines. And what I really like, they cook your meal in front of you! Chef Olindon is great, and the restaurant manager Micael too. Totally recommended :)"
Great food,We had a family dinner last night!! Food was outstanding!! Great service!!the real italian food in Singapore!! We will be back!! Thank you Solo Ristorante
A great emotion,"I went with friends, FANTASTIC food. beautiful local and nice atmosphere. A special thanks to the chef Olindo, super nice and competent. we will come back safe!"
Amazing Pasta and service!,"Solo definitely gave the most pleasant dining experience this year for me and 2 of my friends. This modern and unassuming Italian restaurant surprised us with a round of bubbles for a start and also the most delicious mushroom dumplings or should i call it the mushroom ravioli ! The manager and chefs were friendly and so welcoming as we flooded them with queries on where they came from, what kind of tomatoes they were using.. as we sat at the counter seats facing the kitchen operations. We had the Ravioli granchio/crab ravioli pasta, duck ragout and also the pork ragout. I love the ravioli granchio.. each bite was bursting with flavor and the portions were huge. Ther ewas unfortunately no room to have desserts but we will definitely be back for more soon!"
Feels like i am back in South Italy again! Must try!,"The manager was professional and very hospitable. I have been to many Italian restaurants in Singapore but i was blown away by their chef's specialty, the duck ragu, pork ragu and seafood Ravioli, the portions were just nice, not too little and not too much. The pasta sauces were flavorful and not over powering. You can tell the chefs take pride in what they do, definitely feels like a home cooked italian meal i had in Bari, in South Italy. Definitely a must try!"
Grazie Ragazzi !!,"My wife and I, had dinner at this lovely italian place last week. The warm hospitality and sublime food from Chef Olindio is something beyond words! We shared few appetizers then my wife took a Special Risotto (Orgasmic!!) and i had the Pork Belly cooked to perfection. A lovely Torta Della Nonna and a deliciuos Tiramisu' both paired with a glass of Mirto ended a fantastic night! Grazie Ragazzi we will be back!!"
A gem!,"This was certainly, one of our most enjoyable dining experiences this year. This modern Italian restaurant, smacked right in the middle of Amoy Street, serves up modern Italian with subtle asian accents. We sat at the kitchen counter to obtain a vantage view of kitchen operations. Opted for two sets of degustation - one seafood based, and the other, meat based. The former came with an appetiser of salmon carpaccio, crab ravioli pasta, mixed seafood stew and vanilla custard creme. The meat variant came with smoked duck breast, pappadelle, grilled Australian beef tenderloin and homemade Apple cake and ice cream. We thoroughly loved the dinner. The crab ravioli came with hints of lemongrass; a nice twist in a classic Italian pasta dish. The pappadelle with beef ragout, was not a favourite with wifey but i loved it. We could at least agree on the pappadelle, home-made, being al dente. The broth in the seafood stew was robust and had great depth. Could the salmon carpaccio come with more acidity ? Wifey and I were split on this. Chef Oliver, from Naples, who we had been engaging in conversation much of the evening, told us he would have preferred more acidity too but some customers had been more averse. We thought the dessert of Apple cake with ice cream worked a treat. A couple of Proseccos, Chiantis, and Pinot Grigios later, we felt good. Was it fancy cooking with liquid nitrogen? No. Was it honest cooking well executed? Yes. Good service and ambience too. Only surprise to us, given the quality on offer, was that the restaurant was not fuller."
A Lovely Italiano Momento,"I was blown away with my friend & partner with this restaurant. Convenient to park, great hospitality, friendly chefs & manager as well as the freshness of our food and seeing how food were cooked from an open kitchen was definitely awesome.
Must visit, must try and enjoy!!!"
fabulous food and great service,"We have a great meet and brilliant service at Solo... really the food was simple, great ingredient.... fantastic.

But the service was beyond anything you could imagine. Really hugely personalized, and great intuition on what we wanted, ended on a amazing cocktail. See pictures and there’s a great video but TripAdvisor doesn’t allow videos."
Authentic Italian Restaurant Amoy Street with great wine,"Besides authentic Italian menu they also offer free flow brunch on Saturday. I enjoy the ambience the service from the team and delicious dishes like the octopus , pasta , grilled beef , tuna and dessert."
Disappointing,"Second dinner visit in 4mths.

No more omakase style dinner but replaced with a set dinner. Head chef is no longer Chef Fratini but a female chef (as quoted by the manager)

Grilled octopus in speciality menu is out of stock which is odd.
Burruta was so-so. Tasteless ribeye steak. Unimpressive lobster pasta of the day.

Service crew were not attentive, untrained and insincere.

Not sure what happen to chef Fratini and his crew, but definitely not worth a visit or experience."
Really Authentic Italian restaurant with a twist,"We had a really enjoyable meal.
The burrata was to die for and the cauliflower soup was exquisite.
My main course was Lamb Rack with Chopped Pistacchio crust, which was so delicious and my husband had a really juicy Branzino- he said it was the best he has had.
I would thoroughly recommend."
Newest Trendy Restaurant in Amoy St CBD,"One of the best place to dine in the CBD area. Entering a cozy atmosphere + an amazing food- wrapped up our night.

Try their “Orecchiette all’anatra” pasta with Duck -its a must try!

Not just great for dinner also a good stop for lunch with their 3-4course menu.Bravo"
Average Italian,The head waiter comes across a very condescending at first. He grew on us but as they say... you only get one chance at a first impression. We had the set lunch. The appetizers arrived with promise. Nice assortment that included prawn and salmon. The rest of the meal was less than stellar. All very well cooked but under seasoned. Not worth a second trip.
Excellent experience,"We had an excellent experience in this 100% owned and managed italian restaurant. Delicious food and supreme wine, really fresh quality directly from Puglia, in the south of Italy. Moreover a magic touch from the Manager Micheal Musoni gave us a truly italian experience in Singapore . Well done guys, strongly recommended."
Excellent BUT where is Chef Gabriel Fratini?,"The ambience is that of a modern Italian restaurant in keeping with other establishments in the area. The kitchen is within the restaurants seating area so you can appreciate the skills of the food being prepared by a well-known senior Chef-in-residence.

We had the degustation menu comprising 8 dishes (soup, seafood, slow-cooked pork, lamb, pasta & beef); all well executed with outstanding table service.

At $98++ this was not cheap however given the quality of the produce and the fact that a renowned MasterChef such as Gabriel Fratini was the driving force behind the menu and skills in preparing the courses it definitely justified the bill at the end of the night……. however, I have just one burning question…

What happened to Chef Gabriel?

On enquiring the whereabouts of Chef Gabriel on the night we were there, I was informed that he is no longer associated with Solo Ristorante which was both a surprise, given he is still featured on the website, and a huge disappointment as HE was the only reason we came to Solo Ristorante.

If you are considering dining at Solo and expecting to see a renowned Chef with decades of experience preparing the food with whom you can interact with then please be aware this is now not the case. To be clear, the food and services were brilliant however without Chef Gabriel I would question the pricing after all people pay to see the Godfather of Italian food in Singapore (Quote from Solo Website)."
fantastic food for a decent price!,"on recommendations fo friends we booked at a table at Solo - and it was fantastic - we had the 8-course degustation menu (this changes all the time since the ingredients are locally sourced and always fresh)- starting off with Scallops with crab meat, beetroot and caviar followed by prawns in orange sauce, zucchini caramelised onion and tomato, followed by baramundi with a fava bean puree and asparagus in lemon butter. then we had pork belly with a tomato vinaigrette followed by ribeye with mashed potatoes and beef jus. after that came a pork ragu with porcini flavoured pasta - finally as a desert came tiramisu and panacotta with blueberries...
with that we had a great bottle of red - a 20011 Brunello di Montalcino

the service by Micael were great and his recommendations for the wine fit the dinner exactly!
overall a wonderful experience - both in ambience and in the food!
we will be back !"
Surprisingly good,"Was expecting the run of the mill type of Italians fare but surprisingly it was not. And I am Glad it was not. The appetisers came in a plate of 3: Sicilian prawn , meat and fish. The main was pasta with meat. Rounding off with 2 types of desserts . I am not a fan of panna cotta but interestingly the one served here is pretty different from other restaurants. It came with blueberry and raspberry to give it a tinge if sourness which makes the whole meal so wonderful . Will be back for sure !"
Amazing food with great ambience,"Hosted a surprise birthday dinner here for my husband and everything exceeded my expectations! We've been offered a beautiful set menu with paired prosecco, service was great and everyone LOVED the food. The ""private "" dining room was just the right size for a party of 16 -20 people with great ambiance and privacy. The cherry on top Was the personalised menu printed for the occasion and placed for each guest, wishing hubby happy birthday before describing the mouth watering dishes to follow. A special thanks to the manager Micael who were very helpful and professional from start to finish. It couldn't have been better!"
