Good place for catch ups,"A group of us met after nearly thirty years for a get together and were pleasantly surprised by the very courteous and professional service of the staff at PS Palais Renaissance
Very attentive yet discrete, you guys made it a memorable experience.
Keep it up all!"
Poor service,"there was a dining limit of 90 min but since there were so many empty tables, don't understand why we had to leave. staff still bluff us there were pple out there waiting for the table. when we went out, there was nobody queuing at all."
"~ Good Food, Good Service, Good Environment ~","Mano, Dayah and the rest of the staff who welcomed and attended to us were friendly & attentive. Always leave space in your stomach for their eclairs !"
"Good service, good portions, good quality.","This is a building I last came twenty years ago so it’s refreshing to see a lovely restaurant called PS Cafe on level two. Like the one at Dempsey (which i went for breakfast), there is a garden theme for ambience.

Food came in generous portions. For the soup, the server offered to split into two bowls for two of my fiends to share, and each came with a most delectable toast too. We ordered salad, sandwiches, pasta and couldn’t finish! For a place which sells cakes, they allowed us to bring our own to celebrate a birthday - that was nice.

Service was very good.

Not sure if I’ll specially drive down here again as it’s out of the place for me, but for those who are in the vicinity and contemplating a visit, do come. I trust you will have a good time."
Evening meal at PS Cafe,"Friendly staff ushered us to our table, efficient service.A bistro style cafe with high ceilings giving a spacious feeling to the long room.I had pasta with lovely crisp beans, asaparagus with shaved Parmesan on top.The food was cooked perfectly, no heavy sauces.Served in a large bowl which 2 people could share! Had a lovely Pino Grigio wine which was perfect with the wine.
Nice ambiance with friendly and prompt service."
Server's Attitude could have been better.,Server exhibited impatience and gave us a slight rude tone upon our request for clarification for drink menu.
Great ambience.,"Great vibe and ambience of the place. Food is good, but more towards pricey side. Would be nice if the menu show picture of the food ordered."
Family Xmas Dinner,"The outside was nice but a bit warm, staff friendly but not that fastest..Construction at the thai embassy was a bit annoying"
Beautiful restaurant.,"This restaurant is beautiful. The flooring, high ceiling and outdoor space is lovely. We went on a rainy Monday afternoon and it was quiet and not too busy. This is my favourite PS branch although the Dempsey outlet’s outdoor has its own charm."
Sunday lunch family,"As usual really good service, staff are great and food also. I bit overpriced.
I had a lovely time with my son lunch. See you soon"
Good Ambience!,Happy with the food. We ordered 3 set of Junior Meals come with Ice cream however i forgot to remind them to serve it.
Great service and wonderful experience for birthday celebration,My family had a wonderful experience at PS Cafe in Orchard. I mentioned that I am having a birthday celebration recently and the staff gave us a complimentary delicious cake with a lighted candle and making the celebration special for us. The food was delicious and the ambience and decor was elegance and great. Thank you for the wonderful experience. PS Cafe is my favourite restaurant in Singapore. Highly recommended
Nice ambience & delicious food,"Like the ambience here and food is delicious.
There is indoor and outdoor dining place.
Cosy place - good place to chill.
Price is $$ but portion is big. Service is good."
Average Food,"Food was average and overpriced!

Came to order pizza but this outlet do not have it :(

Ordered portobello mushroom soup, cauliflower gratin, crab tart, impossible burger, ps club sandwich (without bacon)[Must try!] and sticky date pudding [Must try!]"
Awesome brunch,"Food was awesome, greeted by good service the moment when we entered the Cafe till we walked our way out with a happy and satisfied tummy. Well done"
food and service,"it wasn’t my first time over at PS cafe, but it was my first having to meet some pretty unfriendly staff, didn’t seem like they wanted to work."
Great lunch,"Always an attractive setting, this was a great choice for a 3-generation group lunch, including several elderly diners. The menu offers something for everyone and dishes are fresh, well-prepared and generous in size. Most of all, our senior server was wonderful in taking care of us and ensuring we all had a very enjoyable time."
Nice food and ambience,"It was for my birthday and had a wonderful time with my wife and daughter, food being great and place cosy."
Not enought light..,"They have some nice varieties to choose from. Foods are nice.. But seems like the atmosphere are gloomy and dark.. Ceiling lights are not bright at all, and can tell the light bulbs need replacement...This kind of cost saving is just too way off."
Good food,"I love the carbonara i ordered, love the ambiance, love the sticky date dessert, my fave. I always come here for the ambiance and i love all of your branches. Just maybe not too much pushing on what special on the menu since I am the type who like to stick to what I want. No need to shove into me what I do not feel like eating. Recommending is fine, pushing is not cool."
Wonderfully good.,"Good place, good ambience.
Food was good as well.
Service and attentiveness could have been better.
Over 4/5, good one!"
Not good service,"As soon as we walked in we were told we would have to give our table back in an hour and a half. Usually it’s two hours and also it’s quite tacky to tell your customers that, especially when it’s an expensive restaurant. We believe the person who spoke to us was the manager because she was older than the rest. When we ordered they continued to speak to us in a rude way. I won’t return to this location."
Dining time restrictions,"When I made the reservation I was not informed that there will be dining time restrictions of 90 mins. I went there with friends for dinner,‘desserts and wine. I don’t like to be rushed hence was put off"
Nice!,"Good service! The food is in huge size, also the dessert is great. The only problem is that the tables are toooooo small."
Got our orders mixed up,"And we were charged extra when they corrected it, ie we ordered two Caesar salads, one without dressing due to dairy allergies with chicken, other normal without chicken but the normal came with chicken and the dressing-free one without. Obviously we couldn’t move the chicken over since there was dressing over the chicken so they had to add chicken to the dressing-free one but they charged us extra for it which means we had to pay for their mistake."
Disappointing Experience,"There is a strict 90min time limit so if you are in a business meeting and it overruns, expect to be unceremoniously booted out of the restaurant (by the service manager no less) Very Embarrassing for me and my guests and a disappointing first time experience at PS."
"Boring menu, not as good as it used to be","Went back to PS after 3 years away from Singapore, and I found the menu to be unimaginative. There used to be kale benedict, spinach soufflés etc, but this time around, was greeted with more of the usual flair of fish and chips, burgers and pastas. The food was mediocre and not as good as it used to be."
Dinner at PS cafe,"the food we ordered taste average, the mushrooms soup, the fish and chips and the truffles fries, nothing fantastic. plus the construction beside ,so the view wasn't that great"
Beautiful place but very poor service,"The location and deco is amazing. However the service is terrible. We went with a group of friends on a Friday night. Our reservation was for 8:30pm and by 9 we were told we have to place last orders. At 9:15pm the bill came and we were rushed to pay while we were still eating.
I had asked for something to be changed for the dish I wanted due to a food intolerance and was told No right away and borderline rude manner."
"Great ambience, cosy oasis",This is my favourite PS location. It has a quiet elegant ambience tucked away in a cosy oasis just off the hustle and bustle of the convenience of Orchard Road.
Xmas family dinner,"PS Cafe @ P.R. has always been the restaurant of choice for our Xmas dinner. Service & ambience have always been consistent. Service is quick, waiting team has always been attentive. The highlight is as always the choices on the menu (mains, appetisers & desserts as well as drinks) are always plentiful. Although the same Xmas tree has been there every Xmas, it has been well maintained! Always lovely to see the elegant tall Xmas tree! Ordered club sandwiches, special seafood mee goreng, roast chicken pasta (wanted the special Xmas roast chicken but it was sold out at 7.30pm). Kudus to the team, everything was perfect including taking note of our special requests (no tomatoes, less oil etc). We will be back!!!"
Mixed bag,PS Cafe is always an amazing place to eat. The new staff seem like a kid was a bit rough round the edges and not well trained with things. So I won’t rate the service that great
Great place to dine,"Highly recommended dining area, the food and taste presentations are delicious and pleasing to the eye and served at the right temperature and portions"
Service and Food,"Overall the restuarant was rather cozy, service was good and the food are acceptable for the price point. No bad reviews/comments."
Very good food,"Very good food and service. Just a little pricy on the food. The atmosphere is good for Christmas. Is good for dates, friends and family dining."
Great choice for meal/desserts,"Certainly a great place and food choices with family and friends.

It tends to be quite crowded so best to make reservations if you are coming in a group."
Nice place to chill,Nice environment and atmosphere to chill and have a cuppa and snacks with friends to catch up or rest your feet after afternoon shopping. Service is by the team is good too!
Enjoyable experience,"We really enjoyed our dinner experience here! The food was good all around. For the first time I tried the Impossible Burger which was well worth it! The Chicken Penne was tasty too. If you’re in the mood for desserts just be sure to let them early, before they close up that section. Thanks once again!"
Very good service,"Very nice and friendly staff , especially the short haired lady who was in charge of our table!! thank you"
9pm we were kicked out!,The food was good as usual but the restaurant was like an igloo. I think that some people haven’t heard about climate change and reducing the AirCon… Also at 9PM the waiter came with the check and told us that they were closing. When I said that it was 10:30PM the limit fixed by the gov he said no it’s 10. But it still told us that they were closing (at 9)… Lazy service
2 person limited dining,"lesser crowded than usual because of the limited dining capacity
forgotten to chase us out after we sat there for 3hrs"
Love it,"The food and ambience are excellent! Staff Jeremy us very helpful! :) Love the Sticky Date pudding, Orange Cake and Truffles fries!"
Awesome experience,"Food is good, especially the blackout cake. Service by Jeremy was outstanding! Would definitely come back for the service:)"
Good food great service,A pleasant experience at the PS Cafe @ Palais Renaissance. All the staff are very friendly and Jeremy in particular attended to us really well. Will definitely return again. Thanks!
Wonderful Service and Positive Attitude by Jeremy,"Wonderful Service and Positive Attitude by Jeremy. After being seated outdoor during lunch time, Jeremy serve us with great attention and wonderful accommodation. He went extra mile to serve us our food and drinks after taking our orders. We would definitely come back after this wonderful experience"
Excellent service,"Good food, the taste is delicious. Excellent service, especially from Karen. Will come again. Thank you."
Best place for a nice Sunday brunch!,"Had a craving for the prawn and crab laksa from here and was so glad that the laksa did not disappoint! With generous portions of prawn, crab meat and fishcake, I slurped the laksa goodness til the very last drop of gravy! My partner had the flavourful thai basil chicken bowl and was even provided with more chili padi for that extra kick! It was also great that mimosas were going for 1-for-1! Will definitely be back for the good food and chill ambience!"
"Nice Ambience, Friendly & Helpful Staff",Nice ambience and great food. All staff are friendly and helpful especially Karen who served us. She is very attentive & accommodating. Planning to go back soon.
Lacking service at PS Cafe,"Staff were generally very lacking in service, not observant or customers' needs around. Many customers were seen looking to signalling passing staff. Staff lack observation, enthusiasm and even synergy such that even if they noticed waiting customers in queue or signalling, they take own sweet time to respond slowly."
Nice atmosphere,"The atmosphere is fantastic, relaxing to have dinner with friends especially in the time like this(pandemic)."
Awesome time here!,"First time here, with my mom and sis. Food and service was fantastic. Love the starters - truffle fries, cauliflower gratin and seafood platter. The mains - king prawn pasta and crab tart do not disappoint too. The tea and sticky date pudding put a sweet ending to the lunch. Our table was served by Karen - a very pleasant and friendly server. She had our orders down to the details and knew just when to serve the next dishes. Great place, great ambience, great food and great service. Will be back!"
Service,Alex gave extraordinary and attentive service. Topped up water without the need to ask and also served with a smile
Attentive service,"Had an excellently romantic evening at the OpenTerrace at PS Cafe made even better by the delectable menu of Thai basil’s chicken food and Roasted chicken and the attentive service of Karen, a very attentive host"
"Highly recommended, quality food and great service","The staff was attentive and accommodating. Their service goes above and beyond, best experience at PS Cafe outlets. The food was of great quality and definitely large portion! Would definitely visit again :)"
Disappointed with food,"Svc was ok but the food was terrible. Under seasoned and cold. food we ordered (beer battered fish and chips, PS burger) was not up to std. Perhaps the chef was having a bad day but diners should not have to pay the price.... Terribly disappointing and unbecoming. Fries for 2 kids meal was cold and hard."
Good Service / Good Food,"The fish and chips was great! Service by Karen was also extremely friendly, attentive and always with a big smile. Keep it up!!"
Awesome,"It is my first time at P.S.Cafe with my friends staff are friendly and accomodating, food is great,ambiance is definitely beautiful and neat we are planningvto come back soon"
Great Service! Beautiful Ambiance,Friendly staff and the ambiance was satisfying on the eyes! Really love the food the serving was just right for the both of us!
Good,Served by Ben for my friend’s birthday celebration. Very good service. Ben had been really nice and welcoming. Thank you! :)
Dinner,"Excellent service by Ben.
Love the decor
Ps cafe is always tastefully decorated
Great place for dining.
The food is always so yummy !"
Good service,"Very nice service. Served by Ben for my friend’s little birthday celebration, he was nice and welcoming. Will return again :)"
Great food and atmosphere,We had a great lunch today with really good dishes (Glazed Ocean Trout Soba and 100% Superfood Salad) and service from Ben. We look forward to coming back for dinner! :)
"Nice food, very nice staff (Alex) Palais Renaissance branch","I really love the food, place and the service. Special mention to Alex. Very accommodating. I also visited the East Coast branch. But im more comfortable and i feel more welcome at the Palais branch."
Food was average and pricey,"Nice ambience settings but food was average. Expectation of food was a let down. However, staff was proactive to rectify issues raised and follow up with it."
Best Service - Kudos to Ben,"Had visited different PS Cafe Outlets in the past years. Served by a young gentlemen, Ben. Highly attentive and provided us top-notch service throughout the dinner. 5 Stars employee to the organization, congrats."
"Decent food and ambience, great service, $$$","Food was decent, but not worth the price. Although, it should be noted that the price is mostly for the ambience and service, not really for the quality of the food. If you want really yummy food worth the price, try some other place. If you want nice pictures, this is the place. Their blackout chocolate cake is to die for, an absolute must-have for chocolate lovers - but remember to share it because there’s a fine line between not having enough of this cake and getting absolutely sick of it. Service was great! The ambience could do with some music in the background, but the use of plants and flowers around the restaurant was wonderful (:"
Hits the right spot,"Good food, friendly attentive service, very nice interior design. Pricier side but you get value for it. Better for small groups."
Food not up to Standard,"Food not as good as Harding (went Harding 2 times) Feel hot, request to turn on another fan but never come back to us. Waiters and Waitress serve wrong food to our table"
Best service staff,"I come every Saturday for brunch and the food and service is always amazing, especially my server Ben."
Ps cafe,Good service from Ben and the environment. The truffle fries was really nice. Definitely Would come again !! :)
ps cafe,the food was very good. really like the truffle fries. good service from ben. ambience was nice. will come again.
Good Food & Service,The food portions are very big for girls but nice soft and tender roasted chicken. Customer service is good.
Definitely not disappointed!,"Booked a table for lunch here and wasn’t disappointed!

Service was a little slow as they seemed to be short handed, especially seeing only 1 person manning the drinks area and 4 person in the kitchen during a busy Sat lunch period.

But everyone we came across was polite and attentive, and given it’s our first time trying their mains, we weren’t disappointed!

Not a fan of sweets despite numerous visits with friends for their cakes, we ordered mains instead! Had the PS. Big Breakfast and PS. Brunch Burger and the portions were generous! The coffee and the special of honey melon mint cooler was also good.

Thank you to Marvin who sat us down and offered us water immediately, Yuting who served us our food and took good care of us, Jun Yu who took our orders and Ben for topping up our water and payment service.

Will definitely be back, but likely to be at a less busy period! :)"
"Good food, nice ambience, wonderful service",Food was good and portion was huge! And thank you Ben for being so attentive during the dinner. Wonderful dining experience at PS Palais
Review,"Ben, who served us throughout our dinner was very friendly, and very attentive, always refilling our water and ensuring we are well served. Food was awesome! The cake was so good as well. The manager was also very friendly and was very patient with us and advise us."
Dinner visit,Enjoyed the nice ambience & delicious mains! Ben provided a very good service during our dinner. Thank you :’) We will be back!
Great service and ambience,"Excellent service by the entire team, especially Jin Tong! He was super friendly and took really nice photos for us. Will recommend and will come back again! :)"
Great service,Ben provided good service during our dinner. He was meticulous in making sure our order was correct and prompt in his service to ensure we had a great dining experience. He occasionally pop by to check whether we need his service.
Flowers,"There was a huge bouquet of lilies displayed in the enclosed area of the restaurant and the smell was very strong and quite unbearable. Restaurants should generally not have such strong smelling flowers, as it may cause allergic reaction for customers."
Great food and Service,"Thank you for the service, Ben! Appreciate your recommendation of the Butterscotch Bundt! Will definitely visit again. Cheers"
Excellent service and awesome food,"Apart from the delicious food that was served promptly to us, the service provided by Ben was really warm and attentive. Not only did he make sure our water glasses were refilled, he also made the effort to ensure we were dining comfortably. Will definitely be back to dine again, keep up the good work!"
Brunch with friends,"Our server, Ben, was really friendly and made sure everything was okay. Food was delicious as well. Thanks for the great experience."
Friend's Birthday,"Had a wonderful meal, paired with yummy chocolate. Our server Ben was very helpful and attended to our requests kindly. It was a great experience."
Pleasant Dining Experience and Great Service,"Great ambience, good food, top notch service and nice desserts. A must have is the truffle fries, stick date pudding and double chocolate Blackout cake. You may also want to check on the house specials.

Thank you Jin Tong for the great service and placing us a decent table for the great dining experience. PS Cafe Palais Renaissance, in my opinion, is one of the greatest PS outlet in Singapore."
Nice Place,The Atmosphere is cozy. Nice to stay for small talks and catching up with friends. Foods are great. Staff are friendly and accomodating.
Great Service,Would like to compliment on the exceptional customer service rendered by Ben. Food was great too. Thumbs up.
Great Service,Toni is a great guy! He goes all out to serve my friends and I. Truly appreciate and love his service. Together with Yu Xuan. Will definitely come back here!
Family Night,Had a great time here today. Wonderful service by Toni and the whole team. Would really come here again. ☺️☺️☺️
Remarkable service,"Remarkable service at Palais Renaissance, particularly by the server called Ben! Love the indoor and outdoor decor too. Recommend for chill out."
Amazing Experience,"The service was outstanding, staff were efficient and friendly and offered brilliant customer service, they even were able to pack food and drink to take away that I was not able to finish off at the restaurant!! Beautiful atmosphere as well! Highly recommended to anyone looking for a chilled out cafe to enjoy some food or a drink, thank you so much! Will visit again!"
Birthday dinner,"Highly recommended,..i liked the ambiance of the place and the food was great...staffs were friendly and accomodating especially sir tony and ms. indah...we had a great dinner!thanks!"
Nice cosy family dinner,"We had a nice cosy family dinner at PS Cafe Palais Renaissance. The ambience was good, lots of green, relaxing vibe, but the lighting was a bit too dim. The food was good, and the portion was really huge. We should have ordered half plate of truffle fries only, the full plate was too much to finish, even for the whole family of 4. Roasted chicken was awesome, the skin was crispy while the meat was tender and well seasoned. BBQ pork rib was also tender and nice. I find the aglio olio pasta a bit dry as the sauce was quite little, but still not too bad and quite tasty indeed. Overall, a very good meal.

On the service, we were neglected most of the time, probably due to the location of our seat at the far end of the room, and the lighting was too dim. Maybe the staff should pay more attention to those corners or blind spots, or give a button for us to press whenever we need some help."
PS CAFE REVIEW,Highly recommend to visit PS cafe at Palais Renaissance. This is my favorite restaurant for celebration always. Food and service is up to standard. Always feel welcome by the staff there.
Excellent customer service & great food,"We went there three days ago for our wedding anniversary. It’s definitely great decision to celebrate there. Ambience was great, food was awesomely good, and the customer service is superb. We ordered crab tart, chicken parmigiana, tandoori chicken sandwich, and of course their popular truffle fries. The crab tart was really good, it’s hubby’s repeated order. Chicken parmigiana was superb, love it. And of course we love their truffle fries! Definitely will come back for more!"
"Good food and place, but must reserve (or not)","Food has always been great. Willing to adjust certain items based on.my dietary requirements, and give suggestions as well.

However, since we weren't able to make a reservation, we were told the restaurant is fully booked but can give an outdoor table. The outdoor table was just not in the main dining area. We got ours near the door. So I overheard how each guest without a reservation was told that the place was fully booked but a table outdoors was available.

This was contradictory and misleading. I was happy that we got a table but wondered why they have to say that ""we are fully booked but..."" Maybe train the staff to emphasize that it's better to reserve as the place gets busy."
P.S Delivers!,"this is my first time to Dine In at PS Cafe and it really delivers the best quality of service, food and ambiance! I will definitely come back for more :)"
Outstanding customer service!,Arat na! Awit guys. Sarap ng food. Thanks Mr. Toni for the great service. Definitely going back here.
Wonderful Service. The staff,Wonderful Service. The staff were friendly and very accommodating. They are attentive and very cheerful throughout our stay. Foods are delicious and dessert were superb! Highly Recommended!
Excellent Service From Mr Toni and Ms Indah,"My brother whose celebrating his birthday forgot to make lunch reservations. We went to various restaurants and we were turned down.

Mr Toni has kindly and generously welcome us. Gave us the best seat and made us feel so welcome! He provided 101% excellent service and he’s so accommodating.

Ms Indah too is sooo cool. Shes so kind and cheerful.

The foods are great!!! Made our lunch extra special. The food they both recommended are a must.

This restaurant is highly recommended and these 2 staff are providing superb service! Service that will make you come back! :)"
"Great food, excellent service!","We visited P.S. Cafe Palais Renaissance on a Sunday evening. We are glad online reservation is available. We came slightly earlier than our booking time but the staff was very accommodating and readily seated us. They were very prompt to take our orders and the drinks were served quickly. We were delighted with our orders--- Crispy Roasted Chicken, Spicy King Prawn Aglio Oglio and P.S. Steak Sandwich. And our all time favourite dessert, Sticky Date Pudding, is perfect!
What made the experience highly commendable is their excellent service. Tony and his team were very courteous and attentive (fill your water glass even before asking). I really appreciate their sincere effort to check if everything is ok and if there is anything we need. You can really feel their sincerity and warmth.
This is why I will definitely come back at P.S. Cafe Palais Renaissance. I honestly prefer dining here than in Paragon. Kudos the the team!"
