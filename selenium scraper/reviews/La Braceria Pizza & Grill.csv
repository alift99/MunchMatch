Wonderful diner,Excellent as usual ! We enjoyed mozzarella cheese and beef and pasta. Everything so good as usual. Also caramari squid was good thanks for using fresh squid.
A Reliable Neighbourhood Joint,"We have been customers of La Braceria since its earlier days at Greenleaf precinct. 3 of us shared eggplant parmigiana, spaghetti frutti di mare, quattro stagioni pizza and grilled chicken. All dishes were satisfying. The spaghetti portion was huge with 3 big prawns and generous amounts of clams plus squid & scallop. Love the thin crust pizza and the blasted bubbly side rims. The grilled chick was succulent and not dried out at the breast. Also shared the tiramisu and lemoncello cake. Both were well balanced and best, not overly sweet. Totally enjoyed the food and company! Staff were polite and efficient.

You can count on La Braceria to provide a wonderful meal and evening!"
Not recommended for any special occasion,"First time, came for a special evening celebration with family. I mentioned in the booking through Chope that it was a special occasion, there was no acknowledgement throughout the evening. Couldn't always get the waiters attention and the service was par.

From the start, the experience was not great. We requested for more bread which did not come because the lady had completely forgotten. The buratta we ordered was on the drier side and not so melty. Their vongole was mediocre. We ordered two desserts the cheesecake and panna cotta, those were nothing special at all, the flavour of the two were very similar like it was made of the same thing just shaped and named differently.
Their t-bone steak though was quite nice, the only thing enjoyed."
Family Dinner,Great quiet location with friendly service and good Italian food. The pasta and pizza were fantastic! Will go back again
Food is 4 star,Service is great as always I had the fish I was not impressed the pizza is a 4 out 5. They do corkage and that’s 25.00 which is good. Outdoor seating and inside. We had to go inside last night as it was very difficult for Nannie’s to control the children. Try it it’s worth a try
"Fire wood pizza abit doughy in the mid. Food is fine, price n environment is fine. But not good enough to come back for",The pasta we ordered was under seasoned. The cold plate was good other than that the pizza toppings were nice that’s all.
Hidden Gem,"The Best Italian food in SG, seriously. Chess cake is a must. Pizza, Pasta are superb, atmosphere is great. You should book before dine in."
Service,I made a reservation for lunch here over the weekend. Upon my arrival I was approached by a rude and impolite waiter. He did not offer the menu or even a glass of water. Shortly after a family arrived and they were served their bread basket and water immediately. I had to ask for the menu and a glass of water. To be honest one of the worst services I've ever experienced. Food was mediocre.
Triumphant!,"My wife and I visited La Braceria for lunch today and had an exceptional dining experience. This charming little restaurant had, hands-down, one of the most authentic Neapolitan-style pizzas available in Singapore. The pizza crust was a perfect amount of chewy with an almost melt-in-your-mouth quality, immediately transporting us to Naples. The service was impeccable too and the Pizzaiolo Alfonso was kind enough to let us watch the pizza-making in action. All-in-all, if you want a truly authentic Neapolitan Pizza I can't recommend this hidden gem of a restaurant enough."
Food average,"Their menu was well worn, and we had a good range of items to select from. The service was good but food was average. The Calzone lacked oomph! Their lamb rack had very little meat and was quite miserable. Their prosciutto ham with burrata cheese & tomatoes was dull and not exciting. Linguine with mushrooms and beef lacked character, and lasagne was moist but not memorable. Their alfresco seating area was spacious for those who enjoy being outdoors."
Horrible customer service.,"Horrible customer service. Booked a table for Christmas. Reached the restaurant and was given an outdoor table. Staff said we did not indicate we wanted an indoor seating on our reservation. Note: there was NO remarks or option on the reservation site (chope) to indicate. So we told them there was no section to indicate and the MANAGER said we'll have to take that up with Chope. (Well done Manager, you have worse customer service than your staff. At least your staff was polite despite not being helpful.) We were told if we wanted the indoor seats, we'll need to return the table by 7.30 pm (my reservation was at 6.30pm). And without even waiting for me to respond, the manager walked away. EXTREMELY RUDE. Nothing gives you the right to be so rude, not even if you're a Michelin star restaurant. Oh my mistake - with a attitude like this, there's no way you'll even get a star. I was annoyed but at the very least I wasn't rude to your staff. Learn some manners if you want to call yourself manager of a restaurant. Thank you La Braceria for ruining our Christmas."
Nice experience,"Had dinner at La Braceria with two colleagues.
We all had different starters and main dishes, some had soup other salad.
Main dishes were chicken, seafood pasta and steak, all dishes were very good.
Service is at a high standard.
All in all a very nice experience, I will certainly return"
Brilliantly Good Food & Service,"The restaurant is located in a beautiful neighbourhood and welcomes couples and large family bookings.
The service was remarkable and the food absolutely delicious! There is a large selection of pizzas or pastas to choose from so there is something for everyone and the tiramisu was an added lil’ treat!
Will definitely be returning and would highly recommend this place to others!"
Poor Service Experience,"This was our second visit to La Braceria, the first being made several weeks prior, and it was a pleasant dining experience. I made a reservation to celebrate a special occasion and specifically indicated both on the online form and the special request/ section of our preference for indoor seating.

Upon arriving we were informed quite abruptly that we had not made any indication of our preferred seating arrangement and that only outside seating was available. Only after showing them a screenshot of the reservation made did they finally acknowledge that we made such a request. Instead of honouring our reservation, he instead started coming up with various excuses including having called us to inform us that they were unable to accommodate our request.

To err is human and reservation errors commonly occur, what happens less frequently is such poor attitude/service. The experience could have been improved by honest and open communication by the staff, specifically by:
1) Acknowledging the error that occured, instead of denying it multiple times even in the face of evidence
2) Not coming up with various excuses without accompanying evidence as this just makes us feel like we are being lied to

The horrible service notwithstanding, the food was not terrible.

If you must visit, be sure to call in advance to confirm your reservation and indicate any preferences you may have to avoid having a similarly disappointing experience."
bad food,"cold food,burnt & 1 hour late,didnt even offer to change the food as it was very cold,would never order again"
Good Italian Restaurant,"I use to come here quite frequently, especially when I feel the need of tasting good Italian food.
Pasta is well done, pizza is cooked perfectly, all the ingredients look fresh and authentic.
Tiramisù is one of the best you can find in Singapore.
Service is fast and prices are honest."
Good food,Reasonable price for an enjoyable meal . Love the seafood pasta and the truffle pizza !! Will visit again
Good value,"I had half and half Bismark and Carnivore pizza. Bismark is a fav. Carnivore pizza is a little wet though, maybe because the tomato sauce base is watery. Good taste and reasonable price nevertheless."
Enjoyable Pizza,"We decided to order pizza and called up up for take aways. Ordered the Fruitti di Mare (mixed seafood), Carnivore, Rucola Proscutto di Parm- and Calzone. There is a 15% discount now for takeaways. Pizza is enjoyable."
"Well done, La Braceria!","At a time of social distancing, this restaurant is full. They also seems to be regulars. That says a lot.

The staff were polite, efficient and know their kitchen well to accept off menu items. One of use came late while we were already on our mains, the staff could make sure his order could catch up with ours, making the experience more so enjoyable.

I liked my pizza and the rest seems to enjoy their orders too. Well done, La Braceria!"
Sea urchin and fish roe pasta was not up to standard for its price,"I've been to the restaurant many times over the years but I was disappointed by the sea urchin and fish roe pasta in my last visit. The flavour was ok but it was just so little for the price, and the sea urchin and fish roe were not outstanding in terms of freshness. That said, I've had good experiences previously."
Excellent dinner and service,"It was a really cosy place. Authentic italian dishes like caprese salad, baked egg plant, crab linguine. The lamb rack was really good. A must try. To end it off, there is tiramisu and a house cheese cake that is really light and nice. The meal ends off perfectly with a complimentary shot of lemon liqueur."
The best pizza in Singapore,It’s very hard to find a decent pizza in Singapore and honestly even if this restaurant is far from where I live I go and return because that’s just the best pizza in town.
Neighbourhood Italian joint,"Great home made pasta. Service was good . But, strange they served the salad on a hot plate
Lava cake was a good recommendation
Seafood tasted like it was frozen but can’t complain for the price you pay"
The best robust hearty Italian restaurant in Singapore.,"If u have lived in Italy then you will appreciate this: proper hearty soulful honest food just like Mama made it ! You will immediately notice the simplicity of the ingredients. This works because the quality is excellent. The first proper bolognese penne I have had in Singapore. All the cheese used is correct and fresh. The profiteroles smothered in chocolate sauce is outstanding. It was so good I had to ask ... “is the owner of the restaurant on site?” And yes of course ... he is Italian with a big heart and present. That’s why this place is perfect. This place is a gem and it’s been a long journey to find an Italian restaurant so satisfying. And to top it all .... the service is responsive, excellent and we finally get eye contact with waiters in Singapore ! Perfection ........"
Great Pasta,"We ordered 3 different pastas and all turn out so delicious. Pizza is nice too. But the dessert is so-so, the cheese cake n panna cotta is not as good. Really love this restaurant for the ambience, the music, the service and its great pasta!"
Excellent,"Italian place, as italian is one of best in town! Meat great, appetizer super fresh, very nice atmosphere, all very detailed and a lot of locals! Great place, will be back!"
great dinner,"italian dinner with excellent steak and antipasti ! great staff, all very good ! Excellent variety of wines and fish !"
Excellent Italian cuisine,"Came here after some years, looks like a change of management. Excellent pizza as they made it fresh with traditional Italian dome oven. Free corkage for first bottle of wine was great. Helpful staff to help your order . Ordered the clam on white wine and butter sauce was so so good. There are varieties of pizza and spaghetti to choose from. I ordered special local spicy tomato
base spaghetti , a little Tok over powering of the sauce and the spaghetti kind of overcooked in Italian standard. Prefer the less cooked spaghetti. The truffle season now : asparagus with black truffle, egg sprinkled with cheese was excellent s black truffle spaghetti and usual spaghetti and clam cooked with white wine sauce is always great! We were also given free tasting of Parma ham freshly cut! What a surprise.. the ambience is cosy and parking is available if come earlier. Excellent food and will come back again!"
"Tasty food, good service!","Very good and wide menù. A lot of tasty Italian food! High quality, very good service and quiet location. Maybe a bit too expensive compared to the location itself."
Exceeded expectations,"The ambience was great and homey, although the couch seats were a little old and torn. The food was delicious and taste was authentic. The servings were more than generous and the family enjoyed the antipasto platter. We loved the wood fire pizzas, especially the crispy base. Also it didn’t burn a hole in our pockets - good value for money!"
Our favourite Italian Restaurant,"La Braceria Pizza & Grill holds a special place in our hearts because my wife and I celebrate many milestones at the restaurant. Their service staff is excellent and they go the extra mile for us all the time! The quality of the food dishes is just amazing and extremely consistent. This is what we love about La Braceria Pizza & Grill. You know what you will get all the time and it's a regular hangout for my wife and I.

Pizza and Pasta dishes are superb. You will not be disappointed."
Cosy Authentic Italian Restaurant,Delicious food prepared with the freshest ingredients. You can tell that the chef hand makes almost everything. Came as a recommendation from an Italian acquaintance and was highly impressed.
A surprisingly very nice Italian restaurant,"The staffs are very friendly, my sister wasn’t sure where to park the car and called the restaurant for guidance. The manager was very helpful and directed my sister where to park the car.
They have variety of pasta and pizzas for selection. We ordered quite a bit, but the food came pretty fast. We were surprised that the food were superbly nice for the price that we paid for. My parents really enjoyed it. In fact, all of us really enjoying the dinner very much."
Early lunch,"Supposed to open at 12 lunch but we got our table at 1145am. We ordered pizza, lasagna and fried calamari. Service was quick and attentive. Food freshly made. Their bread tastes very good, very tasty n filling. Good value and worth a try. Great Italian food indeed."
Great Place for a family dinner,"Casual, comfortable, with pleasant staff and good food. Will be happy to return. The pizzas are particularly good"
Great Italian Food,It always has consistent ( very good ) quality of food. Cold cuts are good and their cheeses ( Burrata and Scamorza ) are excellent. Vitello Milanese is excellent and children continually enjoy the pizza. Probably getting a little too expensive in value terms to be rated 5 but lovely restaurant all the same. Good outdoor eating area in fun part of town.
Fantastic food,"We had a seriously good experience at La Braceria - I would encourage you to ignore the more negative reviews. The food was top notch - delicious pizzas, buratta and ricotta ravioli. The waiter was attentive and polite (despite our somewhat noisy kids). Great meal...."
Special occasion,"Hi, I visit for the first time the restaurant la Braceria,my wife invite me to have a dinner there,bcse she had a lovely past about everything you can looking for (food,service,atmosphere),
Well I have to said,I had a lovely experience too visited this restaurant La Braceria for my first time.Overall they make feel us at home and feeling very relaxing and free,even if was Saturday and the restaurant was busy and the waiters they were running like a competion instead to walk a bit slow.
Anyway me and my wife we wanna deeply thank's all the staff and in particular Mr Adriano the honor,nice young man.
Thank's again and we will coback soon
Keep pushing!!!!"
Worst service in Singapore: Italian hospitality forgotten,"I have been to this restaurant multiple times so mine is not just a single bad experience but a multitude of Bad service, extremely rude staff especially the manager.
There are so many nicer Italian restaurants which will greet you with a smile and deserve your business.

Food not worthy of the super unpleasant experience"
Service appalling. Pity cos the food was great,"Decided on this lovely looking place because we love Lana cake and this place was pretty near for collection of the cake. About 5 minutes walk. I was really appalled by how this lady staff was having bad attitude towards us. There were also many servers but my husband was clearing table space, plates and taking my family’s orders... It was my husband’s birthday... but I felt like we were waiting and serving the table. They did serve us water consistently but that was about the only service we got.. I saw a manager looking man by his laptop and cashier area but did not bother to complain as I felt he would have been looking how disastrous his staff are. At the end when my lava cake was served, suddenly someone threw the plate in front of me and lit it on fire. No words. No warning that this was going to be done. NO SPOON. How was I going to eat it? That was the last straw for me and i decided to write this review as I must warn everyone about this place. Such a pity because you know what? My lamb was delicious. Lava cake was perfect. My family liked the food. But good food can only get you that far, the poor attitude of the staff ruined the food and will bring this place down. I will not be returning to this place and you can only imagine what I’ll tell my friends when they ask me about my lunch here at La Braceria from when they see my Instagram and Facebook family pictures"
decent,"decent pizza and grill place i guess, decent service, decent ambiance, would come back again but only if in the vicinity"
Very good alfresco Trattoria in the neighborhood,"Casual Italian trattoria, nice terrasse fir alfresco dining, but can be very busy during the weekend.
The staff is professional and efficient. Could have been a bit more friendly but maybe it was because of the rush this Saturday night.
The dishes were tasty, good ingredients indeed, not fine dining but it was what we were expecting from a casual traditional Italian restaurant. Pastas and pizzas were both well executed.
This is a very good place to chill out with family or friends."
Romantic dinner,"Nice place ,nice food ,can feel the Italian chef touch,wine selection very good ,price little bit high,but all good."
Best Italian restaurant with friendly staff,"Had dinner with girl friend. indoor of the restaurant . Menu is perfect, something for everyone. Service was awesome and will be back definitely!"
No smiles on Valentine’s day,"None of the waiters had a smile to spare on Valentine’s Day. Our orders arrived within 10 minutes and it didn’t occur to me that a proper pizza should take a longer time to cook until I tried it (I ordered it for my son and helper) and noticed it was way too cold. Only then that my helper mentioned it wasn’t exactly hot when it was first served. When I asked the waiter about it, he told me it was because of the AC. Was that a joke? I was wearing a dress without sleeves and most of my shoulders and back were exposed but I wasn’t feeling cold at all. Probably not coming back here."
Outstanding in every way,"Went for business dinner with my clients for La Braceria. Extremely satisfied with everything. Staff suggested us sharing menu because we are around 10 people and it was so amazing. We had few starters, Then whole Lobster pasta, Italian seabass in salt bake style, Tomohawak wagyu and Bistecca as our main. The food was so freshly made and big thanks for the kitchen team. Also we had Al Passo magnum 2 bottles of wine as recommended by staff. Wine was pretty amazing. Also end of the day manager and staff offer us limoncello. Service, food quality, Price and everything outstanding in every way. We will be back soon."
"Good food, surprisingly callous service","We have been fairly regular customers at La Braceria but probably won't be any more. We had a reservation for two but when we got there we asked if they could accommodate four because friends of ours had expressed an interest in joining us. They said that they could not do so indoors because although there appeared to be several empty spaces they had all been reserved. At the end of the meal when we were leaving we mentioned to the waiter that all the tables that were empty when we came were still empty. Rather than an apology or even a simple explanation we were told that all the tables were reserved and they had given us the table for two that we had originally reserved. We left and later called the manager to say that perhaps they should consider more considered reactions - particularly to people who came there frequently. The manager also offered no apology and stated very much what we had been told.There is a lot of choice for good food in SIngapore, so I think we won't be going back in the foreseeable future."
Bad service,"Waited more than 45 mins for our mains. The table behind us arrived much later than us were already having their mains. The only reason owner gave was that table did not have starters, while my table had 1 starter. Would never return. Bad attitude."
The place where everything is great,"This neighbourhood restaurant is a little gem. Everything was perfectly executed - even the pizza bread served at the start which didn't need any olive oil accompaniment. I had the linguini with home made sausage and mushrooms, with a white truffle sauce which was perfect. It was a difficult decision between that and the lobster linguini and I simply decided I would come back for the latter. Portion sizes were ideal for me, but could be a bit small for a hearty appetite. The only pain point is the difficult street-side parking - but in the evening they offer a valet service which should solve the issue."
Excellent food and fantastic consistency!,"As usual, my wife and I were looking for a perk-us-up meal after a long week at work and we sought refuge at La Braceria, knowing that it would be unlikely for us to be disappointed. Our usual order of Spaghetti Bolognese hit the spot as the sauce was creamy and hearty! Each mouth brought about that feeling of being transported into a cosy home-run Italian restaurant. Our Prosciutto e Funghi pizza was fantastic! There was a generous spread of toppings on our pizza and the crust was thin enough so that you don't leave like you ate a loaf of bread.We love La Braceria and will definitely return for the amazing food and beautiful ambience!"
Good pizza and Pasta but disappointed with the Tiramisu,"We enjoyed the burrata cheese, lasagna, spaghetti vongole and pizza. They were well prepared and had fresh ingredients. However, we were extremely disappointed with the Tiramisu. It was dense and dry."
Great Food for a date,"The crab meat pasta was excellent! You could even smell it without eating.However, the pizza was rather soggy. When you try to take a slice up, the toppings were falling apart! I am not sure if that was done on purpose hence meant to be."
a piece of Italy !!,we had a wonderful evening with great food and good white wine !! for a moment we forgot to be here in Sg .... cheese cake to try absolutely !!
Dinner at La Braceria,"Ordered 3 dishes for sharing with my friend (Burrata e Prosciutto di Parma / Fettucine Norcina / Rucola Prosciutto di Parma). Dishes were good and prices were reasonable. However, the staff are not attentive and did not top up the water as frequently. As they required the table back early, their actions might be abit pushy to let us quickly pack our food which had not been finished and handed us the bills so we could pay and leave. It was not even the time to take back the table yet. I was not sure why we could not be allocated to another table where we could eat at our pace."
"Good atmosphere, good service, good pizza","Went with my daughter and wife.

The burrata was very nice, so tasty.
We had the linguine with lobster which was perfectly done.
The pizzas were very well cooked, Napolitan style. We had dinner outside so with the humidity the last pizza slide got a big shaggy but that’s the same anywhere in Singapore.

The atmosphere outside is great.

Will for sure be back."
Very good food and reasonable prices,"We had been to this restaurant many times. Menu has a good variety of food and reasonable prices but needs more consistent service. We like appetizers, calamari, burrata with prosciutto, pasta and pizza dishes were very good too. Relaxing atmosphere, we like sitting outside."
Will I come back?,"Was with a friend for a birthday dinner and we were not very impressed mainly due to the lack of warmth, friendliness and attention when you anticipated it. And when I asked for a refill of the bread twice which didn’t come and we gave up asking. Presentation wise can definitely be improved (have a look at the pic of the risotto posted here)."
Excellent,"Would definitely return, the food was excellent veal cutlet is a must to order see photos and the server we had which was a gentleman a little older with Glasses was absolutely amazing running around like crazy to make everyone happy. I hope the owners look after him he is an asset to them he truly cares"
Slow service still ...,"I was disappointed with the risotto. It was very sour and i suppose it was the wine that used. Will never eat that again. Traumatic experience.

The lobster linguine and Tiramisu is the best so far.

It will be good if the service staff were a bit more attentive with better grooming. They can also speak with clarity."
Excellent food and service,"After 6 years in Europe it's hard to be impressed by the standards of Western restaurants here in Singapore, but La Braceria has simply outdone themselves.

I booked for a Sunday lunch for 5 and recommend booking as the place filled up quick.

Service was stellar, the wait staff were friendly and attentive. Waiting time for food was really fast, and service very discreet - our plates were instantly cleared and subsequent courses served without disrupting the conversation.

Food was simply amazing. Quality of ingredients and cooking brought out the best of Italian cuisine. Everything was beautiful but we particularly enjoyed the veal tripe, the buffala pizza and the crab pasta. Coffee was also the bomb.

Highly enjoyable experience and I recommend the restaurant."
Excellent food and service,First visit to La Braceria and we will definitely be back! Great food. I had been missing veal Milanese and this was perfectly thin and crispy. Also very accommodating with my asking to change the sides and overall service was excellent. And very yummy limoncello... what more could you ask from an Italian restaurant...
Beautiful Friday nite dinner,On an off chance we looked online and found a recommendation for La Braceria at Greenwood. Luckily we secured a table and were treated to fabulous food and a delectable Chianti. We have recommended this lovely small restaurant to many friends and will make it one of our regulars.
Nice place,"This Singaporean restaurant serves dishes that taste like genuine Italian food. Service is quick and friendly. Also the house wine is very much OK. In short; if you look for good Italian food in a friendly restaurant, this is a place to visit."
Calzone is my new fav dish!,I eat here often with my family but have only recently tried the calzone. It's made with parma ham and mushrooms and it's sooo good! Will def order this again the next time.
Awesome pizza!,"We came here on Sunday for dinner, and It was so good. Service great and food came out fast as well. The pizza Carnivora was absolutely delicious, we'll be back!"
"Average food, noisy","Went to this restaurant having high expectations with it being ""endorsed"" by the Italian embassy as blogged by one online review. The pizza was average. In fact my kids preferred the other pizza place just round the corner.

Was there to celebrate a birthday, but the next table was so loud that I felt I was eating at an Italian market stall. I don't recall eating in Europe with such noisy diners ever."
La Braceria’s my favourite,"Great food and ambience, friendly service in a cozy place. Lovely place to dine with friends and family."
it was the best sausage and pasta i have ever tasted,"authentic, lip smacking good food, and friendly attentive service, i left feeling satisfied and will be going back more often"
Italian,We've been here countless times - be it for a couple dinner for two or as a group of friends looking for a good night out. Never disappoints.
Top place and great food,"Went there again with my kids, and again food was top, pizza for the kids and i had pasta with truffles and home made sausage with porcini mushrooms, just delicious. Adriano the owner is a very gentle and caring person. Thanks."
Love it !,"Pros - Delicious food, good portion. Parking valet service is useful. Cons - Service staff were a little rude."
Great pasta place,"Was here with my wife 2 days back for our anniversary as my wife was craving for some Italian food. She had a crab linguine which was on point. The meat lover pizza which I had was freshly made (dough kneading could be seem from our
table) - could have been more generous on the ingredients.
Overall good ambience and the complimentary bread was really slick."
Great ambience and great italian food!,Ambience was great and Italian food was delicious! Slightly pricey but will be good for special occassions. Will definitely be back for the pasta and pizza!
"Great food, fantastic ambience and good service","We had a very nice and enjoyable dinner at La Braceria.

Food was great - The Tomahawk Wagyu Beef yummy and heavenly, seafood soup exquisite, the Seabass fantastic and calamari fresh & crunchy!

Service by Sergio was immaculate despite the full-house at the restaurant.

No pretence - just solid good food and service.

Reservation will be recomended!!"
Memorable food from a cozy restaurant,Great food and ambience at La Bracerie. Loved every bite of the food that's cooked to perfection. Am definitely going to be a regular customer.
Lunch at La Braceria,Wonderful friendly neighbourhood restaurant ambience. Lots of regulars. Very tasty Italian food. Good wine list.
Italian,Top-notch authentic Italian fare tucked away in an unassuming corner of bukit timah. A place not to be missed!
"Good outdoor seating, valet; decent food","Good outdoor seating on the patio and complimentary valet parking. Food was decent - we tried the Parma ham, spicy paste and a pizza."
Good food but slow service,Reservations is a must. Thank god for valet parking. Good delicious food but the service was really bad. Firstly the waiters lack the ability to serve as they seem blinded by customers requesting for them. Strange that they only look at the plates that they are carrying but not at the people who are calling out to them. I had to place my order for a glass of Prosecco 3 times before I got it. Also they need to be more clearer when they ask for our orders. I had a hard time understanding. However I must mention the Indian waiter who was very helpful in letting me borrow his umbrella. I really hope the service can be improved if we are paying service charge.
Beyond my expectation,"Location is a little out of the way for those who take public transport. Stepping in, I see a small simple restaurant but the food and service was great. Didnt really like the fish though. Pizza and truffle pasta was good! Prices were reasonable for an Italian place."
Quality Italian food and service,"Had a Rucola Prosciutto di Parma Pizza it satisfied my cravings for wood fire pizza!
Service was excellent as well!"
Quaint Neighborhood Eatery,"Tucked away behind the main strip of Greenwood Avenue, this eatery served authentic Italian cuisine. Will definitely go there again."
Great pizza,We visited on a Saturday night and were impressed with the typical Italien food in a very casual setting.
"Amazing, authentic food!","Loved the food, very authentic and the portions are quite huge to. Price is very reasonable. Great restaurant in a great neighbourhood."
Family dinner,"This restaurant has poor management or arrangement with Chope reservation. Tried booking this restaurant to eat with Chope on 3 different occasions but always failed to eat there even though every time it was a successful reservation with Chope.

The reason is somehow the restaurant staff would call back few hours before the reservation time to say either the booking time has to be later or there is no more indoor seating. This is very frustrating especially when there was already a confirmed reservation for indoor seating at specific time with Chope reservation. This happened 3 times with me and I must say it's totally unacceptable.

Anyway I have tried the food in the restaurant before. Food is average and pricing is reasonable.

It's not a big restaurant so seating is limited. Maybe they give preferential treatment to regulars and push away other reservations through other sources. But this is terrible. If they can't fulfil the booking agreement with Chope or others, please do not allow the restaurant to be booked through them."
Hearty Italian food for lazy days,"Some weekend night we (I and my Wife) don't feel like dressing up for our date night, but yet want I be in a place that lively and most importantly serves great food. If you like Italian food and the mood is what I described above, look no further than La Braceria - a ""family style"" Italian place in heart of Bukit Timah residential area (hillcrest to be exact), where people mostly walk up from their homes to talk and enjoy the food.
Each dish is flawless and delicious - special mention goes to the lobster linguine in bisque sauce. The atmosphere is not ""chic"", but friendly where people come for dates , both casual and romantic, friends hanging out, families celebrating bdays, and big groups as well.
All this does make the place quite noisy- so be warned - you won't have to shout at the TOP of your voice to speak, but you can't also Whisper sweet nothings into your date's ear and hope she will get it.
It's best for Long conversations with food and wine coming and going on your table and you becoming the part of the atmosphere.
Apart from that - the menu is quite varying and will require at least 3 trips before you can exhaust all the items on the list that interests you.

Revisit Likelihood - extremely high"
The staff rushed us through our dinner,"Came with a group of 8 to celebrate a friend's birthday. Our reservation was at 7pm and halfway through our dinner around 8pm, a staff came over and said we need to vacate our table!! We were not told that our reservation was only till 8.30pm when we called 2 weeks earlier to make the reservation and when we arrived at the restaurant. We had not even finished our dinner and were planning to order desserts too. We told the staff that we were not informed about this and he said the staff should have told us. So he grudgingly took our orders for desserts. We ordered desserts including the molten chocolate lava cake which we were told need 20 minutes to prepare. However, in about 10 minutes, the cake was served and the chocolate was hardened instead of being warm and ""lava"" like. It was obviously left sitting for a while in the kitchen and in a haste to chase us out, they just served it to us. The food quality has also deteriorated - pizza base was soggy and the pasta was quite dry. Really disappointed with the experience and we will never come again."
Best Italien food in this area,"The food is really the best Italien food I have found so far in Singapore.
The service is fast, its just that they could at least try to be friendly.
After going there 5+ times I still cant say that the staff is friendly at all. But again, the food is awsome."
Nice Italian restaurant,"We went for lunch on a Sunday and were lucky to find the last table available. You should probably book before as it seems to be very popular. The service is efficient and friendly. They make their own pasta in front of you. All our dishes were simple but very good. The ravioli with tomato sauce, the burrata and prosciutto, and the spaghetti and clams. We will definitely come back."
Brace yourself to be Wowed,"We had tomato soup, scallop and prawns, beef carpaccio, portobello mushroom, wagyu beef, lobster linguine, lava cake, and profiteroles. Omg, they were all so so good. My guess is if we had ordered everything, it would be just as good. The wine were also affordable. Surprising that with a restaurant that was full, the service was flawless. The owner was also warm and engaging"
Nice Dinner,I ultimately love the tiramisu here. All the meat dishes were perfectly done and served with excellent red wines. Ambience was superb. We all had nice dinner and had a really good relaxing time over wine.
Quality food and service.,Our first visit and found a nice spot worth returning to try other menu items. The T bone was prepared flawlessly along with the truffle sausage pasta. The only one area for improvement was the bit of wilted lettuce accompanying our Burrata. Nice ambience reasonable higher ended price point and worth the extra.
Nice place for a chill dinner,Love the fact that they waive corkage mon-thurs. Very authentic and yummy pizzas too (the carnivore pizza is to die for!)
Authentic Naples pizzas,"Within a neighbourhood use the complimentary valet parking.

The pizzas are the best in Singapore so far. Almost reminiscent of Naples. The pizza guy looked Italian.

The tiramisu was very good. The house cheesecake too.

A good selection of Italian reds!

We were given a limoncello cake not on the menu compliments of the chef. Very nice."
Nice Italian restaurant,- nice Italian food - neat and clean - wait staffs are well trained and attentive - good for family and group
Italian,There is just something about this place that makes me re-visit ever so often. I am guessing the delectable cheesecake!
Best family Italian restaurant in town,"The food is excellent with the only quibble being that the menu seldom varies so if you're a frequent diner you see the same things (plus the odd daily special). Corkage is reasonable, and waived (1-for-1) if you buy a bottle off their in-house list. Service is consistently excellent. Dine indoors or out (under cover), according to the temperature."
Good,"Good atmosphere, traditional Italian food, nice parmaham, good lasagna. Nothing too complain just what you would expect"
Italian gem!,"Authentic Italian restaurant in Greenwood, beautiful appetisers, mains and desserts that are to die for! Especially amazing we're the Profiteroles and the Braceria Cheesecake!!"
