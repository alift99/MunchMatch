A meal after a cold trip~,"A heart warming meal after landing.
The hotpot itself are good and the bubble tea volume is really generous. However, the braised food (ordered from menu) and braised pork rice (available at the condiment table) can maybe be braised longer.
The service staff are really friendly, helpful and responsive to our question and request."
For Dinner Gathering,Weekday is not that crowded but the aroma is really good. Cozy at the airport and convenient. Their tea is free flow.
Ms Wong,"Food looked amazing , loved the appetisers and the yuzu slushies was gd . Taste wise acceptable . Service was a little slow and staff minimal . Options was not bad . Wasn’t very crowded which was nice . Looking to try the bubble teas . Hope it’s gd ."

Best taiwanese hotpot,1st time try out. Both sour fish soup and taiwan mala soups are tasty. Ingredients are fresh. Free flow condiments & taiwanese pork rice.
awesome soup base and fresh food,"we ordered twin soup base - Taiwanese mala and pork tripe chicken soup base. Taiwanese Mala soup base is the right spiciness and numbness level for the both of us while pork tribe chick soup was lovely and creamy for a cool and rainy day.

order of pork belly, sweet corn, “noddles”, bamboo shoots and squid paste is just the right portion for 2.

Da Hong Pao milk tea is a must have here so be sure to order it!"
Expensive experience,Baby squid is special and fresh. Meat is tender. Complimentary tea is smoothing. Definitely will come back again if I dont need to worry about the cost.
Taiwanese style hotpot,Reminds me of Taiwan. Nice service good ambience and friendly staff. Milk tea with hotpot is always a win to me!!!!!!!!!
Great place with friends,"Comfortable place, great service , good food. Pricing on the higher end but compensated by free stuff . Definitely going back"
Warm hotpot on a cold rainy day,"It has been a rainy month, and my friends and I decided to have a nice hotpot dinner. Having spotted the newly opened cou cou outlet at Changi Airport we decided to give it a try. The restaurant design was very unqiue and beautiful. The soup base and food variety were abundant and good, and the food was served in very special servingg bowls. Very unqiue experience, and we had a good time with the sumptous and delicious dinner."

1st Visit to CouCou Hotpot,Came here with my family to celebrate my boy's birthday. 1st visit here. The soup was amazing. We had the Tripe Pork Broth and the Chicken Soup that was super sweet with coconut. Food is fresh and delicious. So delighted to be here. Thumbs up!!! Food gone in a blink.

first time at cou cou,soup looks rly rly good !!! i love the aesthetics of this place it looks so nice and really fancy :-)
Awesome hotpot,"We ordered 2 soup base. The 2 soup bases are sichuan spicy fish and pig stomach and chicken broth. Both soup bases are really good. We ordered the salmon and the cut given is thick! The Japanese pork shabu is yummy and a must try. Service here is not bad, the waitress will walk by once in a while and ask if everything is okay or if we want to add more soup. The only downside is it’s pricey compared to other hotpot restaurants. I would come back again for special occasions. I love the ambience!"
Ordered the Sichuan Mala soup,Ordered the Sichuan Mala soup base. 很麻很辣。非常麻非常辣. I would recommend the unlikely hero- the bubble tea.
great hotpot in jewel!,"great service, fresh quality food, great ambience. nice concept to serve with bubble tea we love the mala hotpot, not too spicy where we can drink the soup"
A refreshing hotpot experience,"Interesting soup base with good quality ingredients. Try the mala, comes with unlimited tofu top up. Recommended to make reservations because they can be crowded"
Great experience,"Very helpful and friendly staff. Excellent decor and ambience, food comes quite speedily. The food is pretty good and there's a wide range of flavours of soup which will most probably fit your palate."
