Local Watering Hole with Good Food at pretty Good prices,"I got to notice Wine and Chef when I passed by this restaurant and stole a quick peek at the menu. I liked the variety and then made a mental note to find out more about this place. I got more interested in it as I found out more. So finally coming here is like fulfilling a wish made almost a year ago. And a nice wish it is because the food is so good and comforting.

Iberico Pork Jowl is so beautifully grilled to have a lace of char while retaining the meat juices to keep the meat tender and moist. Good to be eaten on its own and also good to be eaten with the slightly tangy jaew sauce. I love this so much.

Scallop Capellini features sweet, plump, succulent Hokkaido sashimi scallop, pops of umami from the flying fish roe and very flavourful capellini, which is is a bit like our local favourite, mee kia. A very well-executed dish.

Venere Rice Pudding has the creamiest coconut ice cream that I totally love. The black rice adds the wholesomeness to the dessert. And there are edible sparkles added that will set off mini ""fireworks"" in the mouth. Lots of cackling and pops ensured when biting into them, which is very interesting.

This place is like a very cozy, comfortable den where the locals and expats hang around to enjoy good wine and good food that is prepared European style, with a bit of local twists. The service is very good, being polite and efficient. The food has elements that will cater well to the locals' taste buds and still appeal to non-locals. This is one place I will recommend to anyone wanting to take the first step into trying European style cuisine. I'm really impressed with the food here, not fancy but very delicious. There are other items in the menu I can't wait to try.

Thoughts: Great place to chill, wine and dine.

By the way, this place is pretty dark, so it's great for romantic dates. If photo snapping, remember to turn off the flash (direct flash does not make the food look good), hold the camera or phone still after taking the photos so the lens can have sufficient time to gather enough light to yield clear pictures."
"Excellent service, good wine selection and quality food","Came here in a party of 4. Very excellent service. Had a good bottle of primitivo, half a dozen fresh large sized oysters, pork jowl small plate and 4 main courses (barramundi, black pork, salmon risotto and duck confit). Good quality food and excellent service here!"
Hidden Gem on Keong Saik,"Wine and Chef is a nice and cosy Italian fusion restaurant along Keong Saik in the heart of the CBD. It offers both and indoor and outdoor seating, but highly recommend the high table next to their in-house wine cellar to see the bustling action of the restaurant and into the kitchen!
Food is amazingly good and prices are reasonable, which allows you to order more food without breaking the wallet!
Ordered the Grilled Octopus, Wagyu Beef Cheeks, Deep fried White Bait and Pork Jowl are highly recommended as starters and we really couldn’t resist ordering more food from the menu!
Must also try the Scallop Capellini and Salmon risotto… both were a burst of flavour in my mouth with the right amount of contrasting texture!
Such a satisfying meal and excellent service from Jonathan and his staff at the restaurant for both food and wine recommendations!
Wine and Chef is a great choice for date night, anniversary and birthday celebrations or just your casual chill night! Will definitely be back for more great food and fine Italian wines!
Highly recommended ⭐️"
Lunch,"Good quality food with great taste, warm service crews, nice quiet ambience. Now we become their regular customers."
Good fare,"Hyogoro oysters on offer were very worthwhile (although the offer is only unlocked with the purchase of a bottle of wine on Tuesday).

Crab cake was crisp and light. Exquisite.

Surprisingly impressive vegetables that go along with the pork main.

Duck confit - melt in the mouth, with fluffy corn risotto.

Free dessert with a TripAdvisor review ;)"
Fabulous set llunch,Visited wine and chef again for their set lunch. Choose a premium set at sgd31. Love the meal which taste so yummy and it comes with Tiramisu and coffee. Nice music and great atmosphere . Will be back again to try out duck confetti!
Good Ambience and Great tasty Food,The Food is so good and the staff are super friendly. My friend and myself really enjoyed the dinner at Wine and Chef
We will be back,"It was our first visit, and we will be back.
Almost every dish is cooked and presented well.
I particularly like the lobster pasta and octopus, followed by Thai styled clams. Perfect, except that you don’t expect a large portion. Not a big restaurant but we took a little “corner” and largely undisturbed. Cosy atmosphere.
Wine is reasonably priced by local standard.
We had a sumptuous discount (National Day!) . So you may expect to pay more than we did!"
Great Service,Calvin was great and very accommodating!! He assisted us in our selection of alcohol for the night and also treated us with some goodies at the end of the meal! Excellent!
Quality dropped since last visit,"Came here a few times before. The food used to be quite good, especially the value for money set lunch. However this time it was quite bad. The soup was tasteless and like can soup. The pork belly was better, but a bit oily. And the ice cream favour was simply very weird. The coffee was bland, watered down and tasteless too. Such a let down."
Cozy Place hidden in Keong Siak Road,"This is a cozy place hidden inside the Keong Siak road. A week ago, I brought my bestie here to celebrate her birthday. Nice ambiance & not too crowded, delicious & quality food, excellent wine from Italy, very attentive staffs to check on us and make sure the food is served on time, and more important, price is decent too!

We had Iberico Pork Jowl & Crab Cake as the starter, main course as Barramundi and Scallop Capellini. We love the desserts ~ The Venere rice pudding and also the tiramisu. The restaurant knew that it is a birthday celebration and they have provided a very nice cheesecake for my bestie.

We had the Baruch 2015 recommended by the staff. It is the red with vanilla, oak cranberry and faint cheery, very nice fruit on initial taste. Medium bodied, not too dry but very easy to drink. Definitely should give it a try!"
Disappointing food,"Food is dry, including granny’s wings, and the black pork Rack. Can’t really taste the flavors as the meat was just so dry or over fried. Grilled octopus was also disappointing as the flavors just don’t stand out. For the price, I’d expect a little bit better tasting food to go with any wine."
Dinner on New Year's Eve 31/12/2021,"Ambience is good.
In the current Covid-19 scenario, restaurant is under-staffed for a special holiday dinner. With this caveat, the unsatisfactory part of tonight's dinner was the dishes for my guest and I were not served at the same time, i.e. one of us had to decide whether to eat first or to wait till the second person's dish arrived.
Service staff - despite the busy-ness, were friendly and attentive.
Food - main course the wagyu beef was a little tough, the iberio pork was super.
Pricing - 3 course dinner (choose items from alacarte menu) with a glass of wine at $79 per head, good value.
Overall, 7/10

Great service & ambience,"I selected Wine & Chef based on reviews as it’s meant for my Birthday celebration. Jonathan attended to us & was terrific in recommending us food & wine based on our preference & occasion. The visit was our first & definitely looking forward to returning again. Food quality was good and the wine is very reasonably priced. If not sure what wine to choose, rest assured that you will be recommended one that suits your palate."
"Good ambience, if you ignore the noise","The restaurant has a longish layout, and tables are close to one another (with distancing precautions in terms of seats). Ambience is quite good, really - slightly dim, modern, nice music, clever floor concealed lighting etc. it’s just noise reflects everywhere so even though it’s half full, it’s super noisy. So if you can get over this fact, then this is a really lovely place to chill. Strong air-con, BTW.

I had a set lunch. The carrot soup was rich, very delicious; and the cute little piece of toast went well with it. Tiger prawn pasta was good. Gelato was good too! So was the Americano. The waiter didn’t bring any pepper, chillli flakes, milk etc and I had to call. Otherwise he was fast.

Ill probably pop by for dinner some time to try out the menu. It looks comprehensive and enticing."
"For the price point, got better restaurants around","Food was so so only at best. Ordered octopus and crab cake as appetisers (both not much to shout about).

For mains we ordered duck confit and lobster pasta. Duck confit was probably alright overall however might want to think twice about ordering lobster pasta. Portion was very very small, didn't taste great and it cost 40 dollars.

For that price point, personally there are better restaurants around."
"Great restaurant with affordable price, friendly service and good environment","My wife and I have visited Wine & Chef or 3 times for their delicious food. The food quality is consistent and the restaurant have unique food selections which give food hunter a different tasting experience.
They have extensive wine selection from Italy which can suits to different budget.
The service is attentive and friendly.
I strongly recommend their unique dessert, Durian Panna cotta, during the durian session."
"Friendly staff, delicious food","Friendly and attentive staff with good mains. The duck confit paired well with the corn and potato croquette, and was done very well with a good sauce to pair everything together. the black pork was also cooked well, though there were some parts which were slightly tough, the fattiness on each slab of meat made for a good main altogether. we also ordered crab cakes for starters, which were crispy and delightful, with a peanut sauce and pickled vegetables. overall, a good hole-in-the-wall haunt for good mains and good wine"
CALVIN’s EXECELLENT SERCIVE,"Dear management of wine & chef.
My partner and i, came here abyear ago for our anniversary dinner. Today; a year later, we came back again. We were very blessed to have Calvin to serve us, from the moment we entered, chose our wine, had our food, and…. Complimentary dessert. Calvin was extremely professional, and passionate about serving us, from inviting us in, to choosing our wine, AND, serving us the wine , sharing with us about his opinions and knowledge about wine profiles and, to serving us outr food and dessert knowing it is our anniversary.

What Calvin did for us, was exceptional, sincere and splendid. He was knowledgeable about wines, and was super professional with his service for us.

I would like to thank and commend Calvin for his sincere and commendavle service and recommendations for us.

I hope that his efforts will be recognised and i hope that he will be appreciated for his excellent service and heart.

Would definitely come back here."
Hidden Gem,"This restaurant is one of those that easily goes under the radar on the crowded eatery scene in Keong Saik. Definitely a value for money place. Had a great dinner with friends recently on a Friday night. Very much recommending their Duck Confit and Lobster Capellini on the mains menu. The Pork Jowl and Asari Clams were excellent staters too. Frills free, good service, a varied wine selection, and easy on the wallet. Will go again for sure, and the outdoor seats (3 tables) are great for people watching as well ;)"
great restaurant,"me and my girlfriends had dinner there to celebrate a birthday. Food was amazing, especially the lobster pasta, black pork and the pork jowl! great selection of bottled wines as well, with the service crew patiently recommending us what they thought would be to our liking. service was amazing and attentive even though the restaurant was extremely busy that day, they were kind and cheerful as well, taking the time to ask about how everything was and bringing up small talk.
in conclusion, would 100% recommend this restaurant for the amazing food, service and wines! would definitely visit again!"
FOOD IS SO SO,Food was so so for that price point. Platter was not worth it. If you do not order alcohol be prepared to be ignored and given cold service.
Amazing Gem,Great restaurant with a lovely selection of wine. The service staff were patient in recommending wines and the food was great!
"Awesome food, great wine and first class services","I was here with my wife, initially our intention was to grab something simple for dinner, to our surprises, the food was really good so as the wine. we had a wonderful time in the restaurant for 5hours.
The staff was professional and helpful, highly recommended."
Great service w delicious meal !,Had a great time at wine.n.chef for a dinner! Food was really delicious and enjoyable. Environment is really great for a catch-up over some drinks 👍 Highly recommended!
Food was not good,Food was below average and over priced for the quality. Service was ok and atmosphere was ok too. I’ll strongly encourage you guys to put more effort in the dishes.
Great service experienced with tasty food.,"Came here for dinner with a group of friends and had the most wonderful dining experience!
Service was top notch and friendly, with the staff checking up on us to see if the food served was okay and to help us pour wine. Food was amazing as well, especially the Uni Squid Ink Pasta and Pork Jowl, which left a really good impression on us.
There were also excellent, top quality Italian red wines, in which we had a bottle of Brunello, which was recommended by one of the friendly staff, who were very honest in their recommendations, which helped us come with a better choice of wine, which was definitely worth it. All in all, we would definitely come back again for the excellent service and delicious food and i highly recommend others to try this restaurant out as well."
Best Service and dining experienced,"I visit Wine & Chef last week with two of my girlfriends to celebrate her birthday. We were served by two friendly crews throughout our dining there. Food was great and selections of wines are massive. We love the Curry Poulet, nonya wings and Scallop capellini was so so good!! Would come back again!!"
"Never disappointed me, it's really great & wonderful.","This is my second time visit, food and wine recommendation is always think fr customers perspective (my perspective). Service crews here is always give us a friendly welcome when we sit down. Had tried the cold pasta scallop capellini, wagyu beet tartar, asari clams and there are more.... Had tried a recommendation wine by service guy with spectacle, he are always knowledgeable and passion with his job. This wine is sooooooo damn good, food was excellent.

I would said price point is reasonable and justicefiable, me and my friends like it very much. The cellar is look so good and plenty of Italian wines selection. The spectacle service crew has recommended me a lot of wine and my mind is wide open (some wines I even didn't heard before), never thought there were so much of knowledge and I can said Wine & Chef service crew is way better compare with other restaurant professional sommelier than I meet, I can tell there a lot of homework and know their product well.

Overall food is really good, wine is delicious and service is friendly and really good, me my friends is love it. Can't wait to taste more wines and food here."
Unpleasant Dining Experience,"Reserved a table at Wine & Chef to give my friend a birthday treat, by paying $60 deposit. They informed the maximum dining time was 90mins upon arrival, which was reasonable for a busy Friday evening. We were seated around 7:10pm. The food was served subsequently but they mixed up one of the orders, for which I had waited for some time for my main course, till my friend almost finished his. When it was close to 8pm, we ordered another drink, and it did not come after 10mins. There was a waiter coming to check if we had done with our food and was ready to pay, and then I told him that we were still waiting for the drink we had ordered. He went back to check, and came back with a ridiculous request “would you guys be kind enough to leave as there’s another group of table waiting for table?” We were stunned, and thinking was that the reason they did not want to serve us the drink? The waiter went on “for that we would cancel your drink order and offer you an extra 10% off on top of your bill. We seek your kind understanding that as a restaurant, we have to do it from profit maximizing perspective.........” I did not catch the remaining part, but it was to me utterly unacceptable service from a restaurant that requests $60 deposit for reservation. So we made the payment and left the restaurant at 8:10pm, which was way earlier than the maximum 90mins dining time.

It seems that Wine & Chef is a restaurant only protects their own interests by collecting deposit money from customers who do not turn up. Their food was great, but the dining experience just ruined everything."
"Average food, but lovely place to chill","Got this place as a recommendation from Youtube and decided to try it out. I got the $100 voucher for $70 and ordered 2 mains and a few sides to share for 3 people. Overall it is a lovely place to hang and chill with your friends. The ambience is wonderful, service was quick. Just that the food to me was a little average and i wouldnt mind coming back to the place, but it would not be on the top of my list. But again, wonderful place to chill. Bring your gf/bf here for a date."
Value for money lunch set,"Very good value for money lunch set. The food came out fast, and was very yummy. The portion was a bit small for dinner, but perfect for lunch. The presentation looked awesome. Will come back again for sure."
Pleasant TGIF,"They have a nice and relaxing ambience, the place is fairly quiet, I am able to talk with my friend. The staff is friendly and helpful."
Friday Night Dinner,"Staff were very attentive, pleasant and knowledgeable. I would avoid table 1, and the team moved us out to alfresco seating as soon as it was available upon our request."
Jus a normal restaurant,Not as good as what the reviews had raved abt the food.. Presentation ok but taste is not as fantastic..
Asian Fusion Cuisine,"A great to catch up, nice music and conducive ambience. The place was pretty quiet on a Monday but that didn't stop us from enjoying the evening.
We totally revelled in the Hokkaido Scallop Capellini and Asari Clams the most! The Seared Foie Gras and Scarmorza were equally delectable too. Coupled with the wine, the calories were well worth it!
Will be back for more!"
Worthwhile,Love the ambience and specially customised food. Love the wine collection. The service is great as ever!
Service is lacking,"Contrary to what many sites and even this site itself says, this place does not have wifi. So no, it is not what timeout claimed. That's not the reason for the average rating tho. They do have plenty of charging points which are ideal, the music is relaxing (until I was the only table left so they turn off the music and the lights, cost-saving?), food was great and reasonably priced. So why the poor rating? Service was rather non existent, not the friendliest and welcoming bunch. i have sat there for a long while so maybe I overstayed my welcome as I took more than couple of hours to finish my bottle of wine. The whole switching off all the lights and music sort of left me feeling like a second class citizen or a pest that has intruded a quiet afternoon. The crude tone of voice didn’t help either. Perhaps I didn't spend enough for a better service, perhaps if I had appear here with a friend things would have been better."
Lovely local food with a twist,went with the family just to try. Didnt expect it to be such a gem! They cook local food with a unique twist to make it delicious. Strongly recommended.
Lovely food and ambience,Very good and unique food. Loved the pasta and mee goreng. The restaurant was able to give a unique twist to a local dish.
Nice ambient,Great food and value for money 4 course lunch. 1 for 1 wine at $9 is irresistible. The staff gave us complimentary ice cream. Thanks..
Lunch,"Meal was great and nice ambience. Ordered duck confit, squid ink and uni pasta and scallop sashimi capellini"
Scallop capellini!,"The Scallop capellini was very yummy, umami and full of flavour. Would definitely order again. Worth a revisit."
Worthy of a return visit,Read the reviews and decided to give it a try. Definately a great place to chill with friends of great food and wine. Not forgetting the cheese platter. Will be back soon
Great end to our friday,"My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised with our friend's recommendation for this cozy place.

The wine offerings are plentiful and are apparently curated and specially selected from all over Europe. You probably won't find most of the labels in Singapore's local supermarkets or bottle shops.

I cant remember what we wines we had, but three bottles went down very quickly. That was coupled with a fusion dish of scallops, pasta sprinked with different fish roe. Much yums!

This is a lovely place to spend with your friends or that special someone."
Saturday Dinner,"First time here, nice ambience and great service by the team. Food was good and affordable wine . We ordered cold scallops pasta with Salmon risotto, taste great but the portion of the food could be bigger."
Great ambience and wide selection of wine,Great ambience and a wide selection of wine. We tried their selection of house pours and exceeded our expectation! The food also tastes great. Will definitely come back again and order a bottle of wine (or two) next time!
Was roaming around Chinatown,"Was roaming around Chinatown and made it all the way to Keong Siak Rd where my friends and I found this cozy, quaint restaurant.

Wine & Chef...It’s as plain as it sounds, but what a pleasant surprise that there was a walk-in wine cellar with selections I’ve never even heard of.

The waiter was professional and patient with me especially as I took forever to make up my mind for a choice of a red wine bottle. After about 30mins, Jon (the waiter) took it upon himself to suggest an organic wine. I was skeptical, but it turned out to be amazing! and we had two other labels as the night wore on.

The food? A fusion of Asian/European dishes. I forgot the names of the two dishes I ordered (too much wine maybe), but we had some tangy pork ribs & fries and scallop pasta with fish roe.

I’m a fan of the place as a whole. Good food, drink and service. Thanks for a wonderful evening!"
Great dinner,"Great ambience and cosy settings. Had Beef tartar for starters, was great as the taste was not too overpowering to follow up with the main. Iberico pork collar as the main and it was tasty and well cooked. Ordered the scallop capellini and this was very good. Seasoning was well done . Overall a great dinner affordably priced"
"Great wines, fantastic staff, and service","Loved the house white as a start.
Food was amazing, super friendly staff was a bonus. Highly recommend for wines,food, service. Will come back for sure!"
Dinner,The food here is good. Recommended. We ordered the seared foie gras and Hokkaido scallop capellini for dinner.
Good food and nice ambiance!!,Ordered the foie gras for starters and really liked it! had the irish duck confit and iberico pork for mains and it was very good too!
SSSuper good!!!,"We had the crab cakes & wagyu beef tartare for appetizers and iberico pork & scallop capellini for mains. Everything is a must get, we enjoyed ourselves dearly here!! 10/10 star ⭐️ definitely will come back. Service here is exceptional as well!"
Delicious clams plus melt in the mouth pork,The clams were huge and delicious. Iberico pork is a must order for pork lovers who loves a good fatty kick.
Great Dinner,Ambience was nice. Main course arrived shortly after starter. Food was well done. We had the Iberico Pork and Uni Pasta.
Drink and snack,A nice cozy place to have a gathering with friends. There is a whole list of wine in good affordable price and it taste good too. Pair up with their small plate dishes are such a great combination. Will definitely be back again to try out more of their dishes.
Venue for date night!,"Ordered two pasta and a 2012 Quattrofilari priced at $112. The wine recommendation was spot on, sommelier. Picked up the right full bodied red wine. We did an excellent double decanting. I will be back."
Cozy Spot!,"Nice place for a Friday evening chill dinner with friends, and delicious food too! The scallop pasta was very good."
Good food good atmosphere,"Friendly staff, good ambience, food was tasty. Would recommend it to anyone that’s looking for fine dining food at a reasonable price."
Good food and drinks,"Ambient is great, food is good and staff is friendly. Have a great selection of wine list. Pasta is good"
Awesome food,Our family had the squid ink pasta and the scallop pasta. Both were very delicious. We also had the steak which was a generous portion that was very well cooked. Wine selections were also great.
Fantastic food and wine,"Food was great and ingredients were fresh. Had good range of wines that paired well with food. Service was also great, waiters were very friendly. Will come back again."
"Brilliant service, excellent food","Food was above expection, especially the foie gras and the scallop capellini. Service was prompt, extremely polite and friendly staff. Will definitely come back again!"
Dinner with friends,Food tastes yummy. Love the scallops capellini and Uni squid ink pasta. Must order! Delicious. So good.
First time trying Wine & Chef,Got to know this place through the foodking video. I thought the food in general was excellent especially the foie gras. Would recommend
Great place,"This is a really nice place with both great food, excellent wine selection, super nice personnel and cool interior. Absolutely worth a visit!!"
Best Pasta in town!,Beautiful ambience. The Capellini Pasta and the Salmon Risotto is very delicious as well. Would recommend this place to couples.
Great ambience and food,"Ordered the scallop capellini($28) and salmon risotto ($23). I preferred the scallop capellini as the truffle taste was really strong and scallops are very fresh and tender. The salmon risotto was great too but something unfamiliar as they used barley, favorite part of the dish would be the salmon as the char makes it very fragrant and salmon is well cooked. One downside would be that the portion is pretty small but nonetheless a great place to visit!"
2nd visit,I had the capellini before and it was good! Wine too. This time we had ordered a porl collar (it was great!) and the wine recommendation is good! I'll be back again! :)
Good,Good restaurant .. the wine is good !! Kelvins wine recommendation was awesome ... just go for it blindly !!
Dinner was great!,Food is yummy as usual and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely come back again!
Excellent service and yummy food,"A rare gem of sincere and quality customer service in the Keong Saik and Duxton area. The food was simply delish, had the duck confit and croquette, and enjoyed the excellent service by Calvin. Will def be back :-)"
Romantic quiet place,"Came her for my wife's bday dinner as she was keen to give the angel hair scallop capellini a try.

We were pleasantly surprised by this restaurants take on the dish. Delicious, flavourful and fresh!

Had the bbqed pork jowl, foei gras, and lemon tart. All delightfully aromatic and complex."
Good food and ambience!,Food was really good! Restaurant has a very nice ambience. Will definitely come back again! Highly recommended!
Good food and service albeit portions on the small side.,Service is good and attentive. We ordered the uni squid ink pasta and the uni flavours really stood out. However portions are tad small. Would be back to try their signature hokkien mee
Cute little local joint,"My local hood joint in Chinatown area. Simple ambience, good services, small but diverse type of menu. If you like Italian wines sourced exclusively from small boutique vineyards, this is a little retail spot to check out. I am a Amarone fan, they have pretty decent selections at good pricing."
Dinner,Good food nice ambience and good service! Would come back for the scallop capellini and Foie Gras. Great
Cozy setting,Capellini was real good one of the best I’ve had! foie gras was really good too! Duck confit was a little dry!!
Good,"Ordeeed the scallops, irish duck confit and lobster hokkien mee. Was good, nice atmosphere and will come back again."
Not likely to go back to Wine & Chef,"We spend about $130+ at the restaurant.

Ok - Foe Grae, Clams and Chicken
No Good - Crab bisque, Squid Ink Pasta, Scallops, Tiramisu"

Great place to have dinner with friends,"Came here with 4 friends and the wanton mee, which was their special menu item was really good! Highly recommend coming here for dinner and wine :)"
Laksa Pasta is a “Must-try”!!!,This restaurant is an amazing new discover for us! We strongly recommend the spicy salmon carpaccio and seared scallops for starters and then the laksa pasta as mains! A true collaboration of Italian delight and local flavour. We love it and we will definitely be back to explore more dish!
Really good food,The beef checks are tender. Sauce is vry good. Nice ambience and jazz music. Would come back again!.

"Great truffle fries, fantastic wine",The staff were very helpful. The food and wine were good. Great values. loved the truffle fries. fantastic wine
Wonderful Italian Fusion,"Had quite a good time at this little place at the end of Keong Saik.

The capellini was exquisite with its mix of seafood flavours and the pork collar was juicy and nicely done.

What I like most is the wine. The house merlot was affordable yet of good quality.

I’d love to come back again."
Excellent food,"The duck confit, laksa pasta and scallop cappellini were excellent! The cappellini is a definite must try 10/10"
