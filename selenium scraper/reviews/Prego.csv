DISGUSTING FOOD AND EVEN WORST STAFF,"Pathetic food. Even more pathetic service. Went after all the lunar feastings for some decent Italian food. Wasn’t even expecting much. Ordered a simple carbonara, 4 cheese pizza and kids meal that’s supposed to consist of Nuggets, fries and cheese sticks. How could this go wrong? Apparently everything. The servers and service just made it infinitely worst. They served the soggy fries and nuggets to my kid first and I bit into a dubious looking nugget like object that didn’t at all resemble a cheese stick. Turns out it was FISH that was not fresh and smelled bad. Had to describe to the servers more than 3 times, and finally the restaurant manager, who looked like a a really unimpressive and not fit to be in the service line, Italian guy comes up and wants to take away the food. I tell him that my kid is still eating the fries and nuggets and he proceeds to say then he must still charge for it as it’s restaurant policy and he needs to explain to his “boss”. We obviously call his bluff and stand firm. Said that the fish was a “surprise” that they’ve run out of cheese sticks so the chefs have replaced it for us. So they do all this without ever informing us or giving us a choice. And we told him that The cheese sticks was all the my son was looking forward to eat and that he typically spits out fish (he’s a toddler of 4 years old). ZERO empathy and remained unapologetic making us feel sh**ty like he’s done us a favour by removing the dish from our bill (it was $12). Had the four cheese pizza sent back as well as it was Luke warm and the dough was soft and soggy as well. It came back exactly the same. Was hungry and we were in a rush so we left. Zero service recovery. NEVER COMING BACK. SHAME ON YOU PREGO you’ve been a staple in the restaurant scene as one of the first upmarket Italian restaurants in Singapore and you’ve certainly deteriorated to a point that I would waste my time writing this review to vent. ZERO STARS. People reading this review be warned. Plenty of amazing Italian restaurants in Singapore this is an atrocity."
Excellent breakfast experience!,"Breakfast has been an enjoyable experience that caters for a wide variety of tastes and preferences ! Thank you to the staff, but especially to George who went above and beyond in delivering excellent customer service. Friendly , informative, and always service with a smile ! Much appreciated!"
Great Italian Food & Service,"This is a great Italian hangout, with an excellent range of Italian fare; pastas, pizzas and deserts are quality and excellent. Combined with a good wine and beverage menu, this place makes a really good night out. The service and attention are also first class. Will absolutely return!"
Best breakfast,The options on offer at Prego makes this one of the best restaurants that we have eaten at any hotel.
Airy Ambience,"I had lunch with a work colleague at Prego. Staff were very efficient though somewhat sticklers for the rules (no cutting of desert for sharing). Restaurant enjoys clean modern interior with lots of natural light from large windows. Menu was extensive though quite pricey. I had mushroom risotto, a large portion that would have benefited from more cheese. I shared a mud pie desert which was an excellent finale."
"Great, authentic Italian food at Prego","Having lunch together before the work year starts tomorrow.

Everything was good and nicely done today.

The Mushroom Soup was thick and flavourful, while the Caesar's Salad was fresh and came with sufficient anchovies.

The 4-cheese Formaggi Pizza & Spaghetti Vongole were done perfectly. The Spaghettoni Carbonara was rich and creamy, while the Spaghetti Pescatori was served with very fresh seafood.

Their signature Tiramisu was good but my favourite dessert here is still their Zuccotto Fantasia mudpie. Its combination is done very uniquely, and crumbs go very well with the ice-cream.

However, there is noticeable shrinkage of the portions for the food.

Nonetheless, still a wonderful start to the year!

disappointing visit,"carpaccio di manzo was fine. beef was sliced thin enough. however there was no taste of lemon. caesar salad was good but too few anchovies. pomodori e burratta was good except that there wasn’t enough basil flavour in the basil oil.

For the parmesan ravioli, sauce was flavoured well but the eggplant was just weird and tough to eat. Salmon fillet was roasted to a nice pink middle but slightly bland. slow roasted beef short rib was dry and the sauce was too thin. mash potatoes were extremely disappointing - had little chunks, not smooth and just not up to standard. angel hair lobster pasta had disappointingly little lobster and no sign of chilli. lobster, sauce and noodles were done alright. parma ham wrapped cod was tasteless. artichoke had a great texture and tasted nice. polenta was creatively conceptualised and well executed.

the tiramisu was well done - not cloyingly sweet, complex in flavours and with a good variation but harmonious texture. lime custard tart was delightful - good balance of sweetness, freshness and tartness. tart crust was also not too thick despite the small size. cannoli siciliani was good with a nice mixture of flavours and textures however the cabernet sauvignon soaked cherries just became a dish on its own as there were so much. yoghurt gelato was just a disappointing frozen ball of yoghurt (way too hard to be considered gelato) and with large ice crystals in it.

service could have been better as the service captain did not notice the empty bottle of water that was placed right at the front of the table when he approached us. however, one of the service staff was very nice to bring us a ~50 degree C water when we said we were cold.

overall, the mains were very disappointing but the desert was good. all else were ok only. definitely not worth the price. there is way better food to be had elsewhere. hope they can fix their food."
Great setting and pizzas,"Been eating here for a number of years, every time we visit Singapore, and it never disappoints. Lovely setting, great service, nice menu choices. Had crab pizza which was exceptional. Hubby had meat lovers pizza and said that was delicious too. Pizzas are huge but were given take away boxes to take our remaining slices which with us which was good - can’t beat cold pizza!"
Nice Place for Relax Dinner or even for a bottle of Wine,"High ceiling. Spacious Place. Good distance between tables. During this time - it is a very good thing.

Great service - all of them were so nice. Great food. Even allowed us to have a bottle of wine and some coffee the second night with no meals. Which I thought was very nice."
Amazing Christmas lunch,Having just had Christmas buffet lunch in Prego we have nothing but praise for the management and staff. They went above and beyond to ensure everything was provided. The food was excellent with plenty of choice for everyone. Having had several Xmas lunches there this one was the best. Cannot wait for next years!
Anniversary dinner,"We went there for anniversary dinner, the restaurant is huge but at the same time very cozy.
The welcome warm Focaccia bread arrived quite fast while we were reading the menu and we enjoy it a lot.
We shared a Prego pizza and a spaghetti seafood, both were delicious!!
At the end the manager Claudio offered us a couple of Limoncello for our celebration which was much appreciated.
The service from Raj was impeccable, we really enjoyed the whole experience and we'll be back soon."
"Felt unwelcomed, grime on table, served undercooked food","Had reservation but given the first table at the entrance, obviously the less desirable spot with little natural light and everyone walking pass. Despite the restaurant was just lightly occupied. Was that bias against me, a local Chinese family not poshly dressed? That’s anyone’s guess. Managed to shift to an available window table after asking twice.

Undercooked baked salmon - the middle section looked like “sashimi” which I can’t accept especially if it was intended for my toddler. Upon my feedback, the waitress informed me that’s the standard. And if I would like it fully cooked I need to tell them in advance. Most absurd excuse. As a customer am I expected to “read the mind” of the restaurant? If you intend to serve partially raw food, it’s your duty to inform the customers and let them decide how they like it done.

Grime/ dirt in the grooves of the table. Photo speaks for itself.

Overall, underwhelming experience. Have way much better food and service elsewhere for the same price (not cheap). Unlikely to be back."
Top-notch service!,"The best kind of experience one can have! Visited this place with a group of friends for dinner. Their set menus are very well priced for the quality and quantity of food served, given the place. Mushroom soup, ravioli and tiramisu were yummy!
The service was top-notch. Kristine served us for most part of the evening. She was sweet, professional and very prompt - even helped us click pictures.
Definitely recommend this place."
Cool place at Fairmont,"Good Italian restaurant, excellent pizza, but salad lacks some oil. Pasta is good too. Aircons could be set a bit warmer too"
Good food and service,"Prego (Italian) restaurant located at the Swissotel Stamford Hotel in Singapore offers good food, good service and value for money. Our server Yoges was very good"
All things good,"The food was good. Ambience was nice, service was awesome. Food came within minutes after ordering. Thank you to service staff, Yoges for being patience with my order and checking in if everything was ok during dinner."
Prego,Siva was amazing during our visit at the restaurant. A must visit if you’re in Singapore. A classic Italian restaurant with exquisite cocktails.
The lady staff spoilt our evening.,"We happily meet friends for dinner to celebrate birthday, enter prego the staff an Indian national lead us to a table he was friendly. He recommended the seabaa fillet braised radicchio.
As restaurant dishes name was very fancy so we didn't ask or take note. It turns out the radicchio was very very bitter, never eaten such unpleasant vegetables before. As first we thought something not right, than a staff asked a senior staff to explain, a lady in light color uniform quite plum. Think she a phillipino, her reply to our feedback was rather unpleasant. This radicchio is supposed to taste like this bitter. I said why did the chef make this combination it taste terrible.
Otherwise foods dessert was OK."
Great Food + Service,"Our experience at Prego has been delightful! The Italian dishes tasted authentic and delicious. The ambience was great and to top it off our server, Raj, was amazingly attentive and polite. Will definitely be back here!"
Great italian restaurant,"Visited Prego with some friends. Had lamb and Capelini and was very good. The manager, Claudio was very friendly and gave us some recommendations too. Good ambience. Would come back"
Poor and inattentive service,"Food was good. However for that price, I would expect more from the service crew. Made an appointment for a group of 5 for dinner at 6.15pm and we were punctual. We were kept waiting at the front of the restaurant and there was no urgency for anyone to attend to us although several waiters saw us and looked away.

Throughout our dinner, our water was not topped up automatically and dirty dish was not cleared until we signal for someone to do so. Particularly, I was told to wait when I asked for water but the waiter turned around and completely forgot about it.

Just like when we entered the restaurant, there was no goodbye and thank you when we left. Basic courtesy would be much appreciated!"
Great dining experience at Prego,"Wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary recently at the Prego. The last time we’d dined at Prego was years ago when it was operated as Westin Stamford and Stamford Plaza.

The online reservation process was smooth, I’d received a reminder email and phone call thereafter, which was great.

We ordered a signature set with wine pairing and a 4 course set dinner. The dishes were well presented and suit our palette (I’m trying to say that it is more than delicious!).

The waitress and staff were superb in delivering prompt and friendly service.

Overall we had a great dining experience."
Family birthday celebration,"Prego has always being one of our favourite Italian go-to places. We were welcome by their warm focaccia bread, starters like calamaris and burrata salad are so yummy. Salmon main, pizzas and pasta are all nearly done. We were being attended by Raj who has been superbly attentive to all our needs and even help fixed a mistake order by my niece in no time. Definitely will return for more family gathering celebration occasion."
Great pasta,Love the pasta. Amazingly homemade. Shoutout to Raj our server! Thanks for making the night awesome.
Good food and Great Service,We ordered pizzas and risotto. Both the food and service were great. Raj in particular was very attentive and friendly.
Dinner at Prego's,Celebrated a friend's birthday at Prego's. The service was good and Raj was very attentive! Thanks Raj!
Friendly & Attentive Staff made simple dinner extra nice,Raj was the cherry that made the evening into a very nice time - well done and keep it up! Will be back again.
"Great food, great service!",Prego has always been my family’s favourite Italian restaurant and I just had a great lunch with my colleagues thanks to Claudio and team! The pizza is a must have and the standard remains consistent even though the restaurant was packed! Kudos and we will be back soon!
Comfortable and friendly place for dine and drink solo (or with friends and family),"I went to Prego during F1 week, most place are busy and even at Prego also. But the staff manage to give me a table at the bar (since I dont have a reservation) I love the ambiance, the service is excellent, staff are friendly and the food and drink itself is good. The interior also amazing. I went alone, but I dont feel lonely there. The staff is make a friendly chat and making sure that I always get what I need. Definitely will going back there again."
Lovely Lunch,"Hubby and I were looking for a casual place for lunch and came here after a recommendation by another couple. Great ambience and interior, more than decent food, and very good service. We had to cancel an order because we were so full at the end. Definitely listing this as one of the places that we’d come back to."
GOOD EXPERIENCE,went there on monday for for special celebration great bartendress ( special mention the original spritz using select ) and very good service from the manager and his staff there..good food ..dont forget they are special daily promotion ( we catch monday $99 dollar rose champagne promotion) good vibes
Nice Sunday lunch :),"Perfect location, just nice after a morning walk. Had super nice angel hair lobster and we enjoyed the after lunch with coffee and dessert. Good and cheerful service, we will be back for sure!"
Great place with outstanding service,"A great restaurant with an outstanding service, had angel hair lobster ( delicious) & short ribs one of the best I ever had!

Will be back for sure, thanks to the restaurant management and the entire team.

Cheers!"
First visit since 2019: a totally different restaurant ☹️,"We should have picked up that something was not right when there was no greeter on the ‘welcome desk’. We went in and found the maître d', ordered and waited.

The appetisers came at different times with one 15m after the others. Two main courses had to be sent back - I had sand in my spaghetti alle vongole - and we declined to continue. There were few staff and the maître d' had vanished leaving the exit to a new server

We have visited Prego for some 30 years and this will be the last time."
Fantastic evening with my family,"Fantastic food, great wine list with my favourite Nebbiolo. We tried pizza and pasta, definitely real Italian stuff. We’ll be back again for sure"
Amazing Italian restaurant,"Went there for lunch with my wife during F1 week. Excellent food and service.
Mr. Claudio, the Italian Manager was really professional. We will back"
Dinner at Prego,Had a great experience today. Atmosphere was relaxing. Mr Haree the staff on duty was most courteous and ensured utmost attention to the dining experience.
Best Service Ever,Had an afternoon wine and cheese. Love the ambiance of the restaurant and excellent service by Ms. Grace. I will definitely be back.
Fantastic service from raj,Raj came through with a cake for my son on his birthday. Would highly recommend comming to this place and looking for raj.
Horrible Spread Served,"The fōōd was unacceptable and nasty! The Chef not focused and tardy, spring chicken tasteless and not cooked well when served, the beef ribs ordered was too small for the prīs. Waited long for the mains in our table and we need to follow up to staffs but still not worth it in tastebuds and for the value. Definitely not an authentic italian ristorante when you visit Singapore. Not recommended! Not coming back."
Pasta,"Haven’t been back for awhile, the pasta is hard and undercooked. Informed 2 service staff and was given the same SOP explanation by them: the Chef said this is how we cook the pasta in Italy…. Have been to Italy a few times never had pasta that is undercooked (hard)."
Fantastic Service,Service and the environment was excellent. Great location too! Delicious food served (I had the lamb shank) and the manager was very attentive to our needs and ensured the glasses and bread was topped up. Will definitely return!
Food,Had a great experience at prego with servers Grace and Andrea. Food was delicious. Recommend will visit again
YOGES made our day,"The service provided by our server YOGES was excellent. He is really warm and friendly, made our meal so delightful! Prego is good!"
Good appetisers. desserts and great service! Let down by mains,"Fabstastic service from Yoges and great pizza by Chef David. We had a great meal there, which was let down by the main courses (seafood soup especially, see pics). Still we will return!"
Amazing service. Try the Negroni.,"Dropped in for dessert and drinks. Service was warm and gracious from start to finish. The staff were all personable and friendly.
A big thanks to Aizza for her drink and dessert recommendation. She even tweaked her Carciofi Negroni recipe to suit my weaker alcohol tolerance. Talk about personalized service :). Loved the Negroni and the Chocolate biscotti. I was also lucky to visit during a lull period and enjoyed my conversation with her.
Thank you also to Cathy, Jessa, Kimmy and Shila for stopping by my bar seat to check up on me. Enjoyed the decor in the bar and ambience in the restaurant. Will definitely visit again."
Above average,"Second visit, ordered the 4-course signature set.
First course - burrata salad was okay, asked the server what was that, she could not explain, probably new in her job.
Second course - angel hair, maine lobster was above average, very small portion with 3 small pieces of lobster. You can see from the picture. If order separately at SGD44 each, agree with one earlier review poor value.
Third course - parma ham wrapped cod was above average.
Fourth course - tiramisu was good, the sweetness was just right, probably I made the right choice by not eating the two pieces of chocolate, I am not a fan of dessert but I enjoyed this dish."
Dinner outing with friend,Had a wonderful dinner with friend. Food was good. Had vegetarian options. Service was excellent. Wait staff Yoges was helpful with suggestions. Service was very prompt. On the whole service was very good and the food was excellent.
Nice service yummy food,"Had a great time with family... we have come to prego for many years be it family or friends gathering.

Raj our server was wonderful... thank you for making it so enjoyable for my son"
Yoges’s Service,"Yoges gave outstanding service, accommodated our request to add a seat for my son who joined later and made our meal very enjoyable. He is a gem to your organization."
Fantastic,Had a great time here. We were served by Jason and he went above and beyond to make the experience great for us. I highly recommend Prego
Great service by Haree,"Had a family dinner at Preggo's and was served by Harree. Superb service. Always smiling, very speedy and super professional. Thanks for everything."
Shin birthday,"Service person haree was the highlight of the dinner with his great service. Food can be better in taste, service is good."
Below average italian,"We found this place a little unauthentic. Although the staff were very friendly and they made a mistake on first course and gave us a bigger salad no extra charge we found the rest poor.

As someone who knows porchetta and when well done a fabulous choice, the pizza with porchetta seemed like ham. It said with cherry tomatoes there were two, and the dough slighty undercooked.

My pasta dish was not so bad and the 3 course meal well priced.

I had expected more. Ambience was lively,however I am not sure I would return."
Average Italian Restaurant,"Prego is an average Italian restaurant housed in the Fairmont Hotel and the menu and chef plays it safe. We went for lunch with a friend to catch up. The stand-outs were the staff was attentive without being intrusive. The engagement was always with a smile. The focaccia bread was moist, subtly oily and flavourful.

We also ordered the fried calamari which was solid but not exceptional. The calamari was not rubber which was a plus but they also were not crispy. The aioli sauce was a nice touch.

For the mains, we got a pizza which had fresh ingredients but the dough was too fluffy and the sauce lacked distinction. With that said, it was hot and had plenty of cheese and toppings. We also had the spinach gnocchi which was overwhelmed by the flavor less cheese sauce so the spinach was completely lost.

Would I recommend this again? It is a restaurant to play it safe as the menu offers something for everyone. It is not a place to go to impress or be impressed."
Prego,"This restaurant serves great food with excellent service. Love their main courses, pizzas and mud pie. It is our go to restaurant whenever we stay at the hotel. Raj provides excellent service. Very pleasant guy who gives great recommendations n make guests feel welcome. Will be back again."
Great food and service!,Great service and great food! Special shout-out to Raj who is such a professional! The family had a great time and we will definitely be back again :) Kudos to Prego!
Lovely but a bit pricey for what you get,Lovely restaurant. Great food and service. Bit pricey though. Food was fresh and portion size good. Pizzas were fabulous. We are all vegetarian and choice was fair.
Lunch of the month,"Fantastic food with an excellent service. Especially service from Carine, Paolo, Andrea,Azizah and the kitchen team. Once again thank you."
Hit and miss,"Avoid the angel hair pasta with lobster at $44. Taste was average but value poor. See the pic.

Service and decor was up to par."
Stale leftover pasta and odd service personnel.,"We had lunch here on a sleepy week day. Ordered what we felt were some safe items like their pasta carbonara, a pizza , some fish dish and another seafood pasta.

Pizza was good but it was served before all our other mains arrived. we ended up treating it like an antipasti. Gradually, each dish arrived but it really wasn't worth waiting for.

We were surprised to be served noodles that were stale and stuck together, like old leftover pasta. Hardly any sauce or gravy to coat the pasta. Fish was ok but again, no seasoning. When you pay almost $50 a dish, you would expect some respectable amount of meats and condiments. It was quite ridiculous.

We decided not to even complain as servers and manager were just chit-chatting behind the bar. Our main waiter could not even understand our orders when we called them by their proper names. He only understood the concept of pointing.

After our meal, with our plates still half full, he even asked us if we wanted dessert. What a joker!

Once and never again."
Great start to the day.,"This was our second stay at Fairmont Singapore and ate a lovely breakfast each morning in Prego. The staff here are very good as is the selection of breakfast items and the a la carte menu of breakfast dishes of which we tried a different one each morning. The 1st morning we were shown to a table which I thought was so far away from the food area to keep walking down to help ourselves, but then we realised we had been given the nicest table with view of the Raffles opposite outside the window to gaze at each morning.
George looked after us each breakfast service as well as other customers in Prego and his floor staff.
He made my coffee with lovely latte art on that he said was made from the heart. He has great customer service and I think is an asset to Prego and made for a memorable stay at Fairmont Singapore."
Birthday dinner celebration for Ethan Choo,"Made reservations to celebrate our son's 23rd birthday. We were tended to by Paulo ( restaurant manager ) and Raj, and the service and attention was excellent. Our orders included an off-menu item Pomodoro Burrata, and we also opted to check out Prego's anniversary menu for July which was PA Tagliatelle Arugula ( scallops fettucine ), Pescatora and a Rustica Pizza. We also ordered sides comprising broccolini & Arugula .... and last but least we wrapped up our evening with Mud Pie ( for a change cos we usually order the Tiramisu ).

We thoroughly enjoyed our choices, and the service quality made us feel @ home. I've always highly recommended Prego to family & friends."
Nice restaurant with good service,We went for lunch today and Ms Carine attended to us. She was very polite and always served us with a smile. She made us felt very welcome and made sure we were comfortable. Her recommendations were good and we definitely enjoyed our food very much. The restaurant has nice set up and is cozy.
Coffee made from the heart,"I had breakfast here each morning during my stay in Singapore. George was very helpful and accommodating and each morning made me a coffee which he delightfully described as being ‘made from the heart’. On my last morning he saw me arriving for breakfast and immediately went off to make my coffee so that he could bring it to my table soon after I had sat down. Such amazing service and always with a smile. I usually had the Mediterranean dish from the breakfast menu was was very tasty. However, it was George’s customer service that made it memorable."
Great food and service . Yoges's recommendations were spot on.,"We picked the correct choice of mains - pizza and lamb shank. This was thanks to Yoges's recommendation.
Food and service were really good this time, more than the last time we visited."
Service by Raj was excellent,"Food and appetisers were good. Service by Raj was excellent and hospitable.

Carbonara sauce was impressive."
Great ambience,"First time here and the ambience is good, service is great, food is nice! Would recommend.

Celebrated my belated birthday here with a friend!"
Birthday celebration,"My daughter booked Prego for my birthday dinner. I was already full from my high tea earlier. Their set menu was definitely value for money and I decided to share one set menu with my daughter as I only wanted a salad. It was a mistake.... the food was so good, I almost finished the salmon my daughter ordered. The service was prompt and Raj was very attentive as he remembered I told him I had my tea with a friend earlier as it was my birthday. He set up a small chocolate cake for me. Thank you so much Raj and Andrea. Wonderful experience. I will definitely come back again."
Best waiter ever,"Thanks Yoges for great experience!
All the recommendations were great, food was tasty the the atmosphere was great"
Great food.,I broke a wine glass!!! And Gregory had to clean up after me! So thankful for Gregory for being so friendly throughout and letting us feel welcome!
Above average,"First visit, read so much about this place, decided to give a try. Ordered the 3-course set menu. The mushroom soup was good and the tiramisu was good too, although a bit too sweet for me.
The roasted salmon fillet was just above average, one review here mentioned that their salmon is really good, I was influenced by that. I am also searching for another place to go back regularly for my salmon, unfortunately this is not the one.

During reservation the lady staff told me men must be in long pants, but when I was there I saw two guys in shorts, not that easy to enforce huh??

Ambience okay and normal customer service, probably return to try out some other dishes."
Farewell dinner,We had an enjoyable night with Clarissa service from Prego who gave good suggestions to the menu and excellent service . Thank you Clarissa!
Great food and service!,Great food and service as always. Yoges was our server and he was attentive to us all night. Will definitely return in future.

One of the Best Birthday Celebrations I had,"Jessa and Arleen were so friendly and bubbly -- they really made my day, and on my actual birthday too. Jessa especially was attentive to detail, warm, had a wonderful personality, and really took initiative on things. She even personally initiated and helped me take really pretty pictures around the restaurant. It's rare to meet someone with so much excellence and passion in how she works. I was truly impressed and moved by how she treated people. It made my day so memorable. Thank you, Jessa!!!"
Celebrated a birthday,Service was great:) Kim was very attentive to all our requests and needs ! Will come back again for sure !

High standard for food and service,"I
Patronage prego for many years now and I always been happy with the food and service.
Try their pasta carbonara and pizza : wonderful and also the fish is excellent.
Thank you to Paolo and Max for always making my visits wonderful.
A special thanks to Jason who is always giving the high standard service, you the best!

Definitely recommending this place !"
Awesome service and great food!!!,"The Service by Paolo and all staff was impeccable. Very attentive to our needs and always responsive, gave my kid candies and even let him sit inside the Fiat vintage car. They really knew how to warm our hearts, 1st class! The food was very fresh and delicious as well! Two thumbs up."
Great place for family meals,"Great restaurant for family meals that cater to all age groups. Space is huge as well and airy.
Service staff Yoges had been great in attending to our needs too! Thanks!"
Excellent food and service,"We walked in around 5pm to make a reservation for 7pm and was initially given a bar seat. When we came for our dinner later, they gave us a table (which we had requested they do if a table opened up). We were pleasantly surprised that the staff had remembered our request. We were served by Max, Kas and Andrea and they were fantastic. The food recommendation was great, and the service even better. We loved the free bread and the mushroom ravioli."
Good Dining Experience,Pleasant service and friendly attitude from Raj. Food is good and tasty. Nice ambience. Will go again!
Exceptional service,Awesome service from Prag and Yoges! Will definitely visit again! Food is great! Ambience is great too!
Good food and service,"Went there to celebrate me and my boyfriend’s anniversary and we chose Prego. Food and atmosphere is great but what makes it special is the service given by Sze Yin. She was very friendly and helpful in recommending signature dishes and wine to go along. Thank you for the complimentary cake, we will come back to dine in again!!"
Wonderful Service,My wife and I have visited Singapore many times and always stay at The Fairmont. One of the regular highlights for us is breakfast at Pregos and while the food is always great it is the warm welcome snd service we receive from the staff and especially from George who has practically become a family member to us. It's the people who make the difference and the great memories.
