"Friendly staff, excellent food","Excellent experience, friendly and accommodating staff - Brian - was great! Loved the tea and atmosphere and the BOP ice cream. Thank you for a lovely time!"
Fave Crepes,My all time favourite White Chocolate Speculoos crepe . It never goes wrong with their ice cream from Birds of Paradise . Both Chocolate and white chrysanthemum flavour is so good and goes well with the crepe . Big shout out to Eve and Antonia for the service . ❤️
"Come here only if you like gaulettes, otherwise limited menu","Stumbled into this place on a busy Friday evening along Telok Ayer. This place serves gaulettes which can be best described as savoury crepes. If you are not into gaulettes then this is not the place for you because the offerings on the menu are rather limited.

We ordered the sardine gaulettes with another order of organic cured ham and a bottle of French red.

The gaulettes were interesting but I am not a big fan. The ham was decent but unremarkable.

The service was very good - our server was very warm and friendly. The ambience is good for friends gathering or casual business.

Overall it is decent but I am a bit suspicious of so many 5 star ratings by reviewers that only did 1 review in their history. Are they genuine reviewers ? Who knows?"
Dine in,"Nice food, nice ambience and very cozy , good service and very clean. Thank you for the service 👍🏻👍🏻"

Delectable galettes & crepes,"The French Fold is definitely worth a visit if you’re in town (in Singapore) craving something French. They dish out a large array of galettes (savoury crepes made of buckwheat flour) and crepes (sweet dessert made of wheat flour). They also serve cheese platters, wine, ciders and coffee.

The ambience is great for couples or groups of friends to have a catch up. Service crew are friendly and attentive. Be sure to make a reservation as seats are almost always full."

Enjoyable dinner,"This place was recommended by a friend that we should try their variety galettes and crepes. The outlet not very big, a bit warm as they have open concept, great music and lighting. Their staff friendly and ready to serve.

We enjoyed galettes no. 4 (mushroom, ham, egg and cheese), 8 (fresh spinach with pork pancetta carborana style), 12 (masala chicken - a bit spicy). Dun forget to try their salad bowl (shredded duck confit ) and homemade fries dipped in truffle mayo. As for dessert, we have crepe no 28 which goes well with sea salt hojicha gelato and original crepe no 20 with salted butter. GREAT! Keep up!"
Nice place,"Enjoyable environment, definite will come again if gt time. I like the ambient here and drinks, quite relax and it’s a good place to release stress especially after working"

Tasty food and people watching,"My spouse and I enjoyed an early and light lunch at French Fold today. We were pleasantly surprised to find the window seat open and both enjoyed the view. We had Galette No. 09, the Caesar Salad and the Normand Invasion cocktail, all of it very well done, satisfying and simple. Happy to see cider being used in interesting ways in their cocktail program and I saw a few more drinks I'd like to try out next time. French Fold is perfectly nestled in the bustling neighbourhood of Telok Ayer and has a menu that most everyone will find suitable for their tastes - a gem that's not hidden and worth your visit."
Great place to recommend for food,"Great ambiance with friendly and attentive crews! Enjoy galette no. 7 (French Pork sausage), no. 8 (Fresh Spinach) & Wild trout tapas galette . Delicious! Crepe no. 20 with salted butter and no. 23 ....Hmmmm great

Amazing crepes,"Rather crowded and noisy and somewhat cramped but delicious crepes and galettes. Highly recommend the No 09 Galette with Rabiochon cheese and organic Boyonne Ham. Absolutely delicious!
Definitely must leave some space for desserts. The simple Salted butter crepe (No 20) was delightful as was the poached pear, 70% chocolate (No 27) one."

Delicious food and great services,Great service by Jasper and Ida.. The food and environment is amazing… ☺️ Look forward to come again soon..
Very bad customer service,"The restaurant prevents a single person to book a table online
To book online you need to be more than 2 pax.
And when you drop in they always tell you that there is a 45 min waiting list no matter they are 4 tables available in the restaurant. I tried 4 times and always got the same feedback.
It’s discrimination.
Poor customer service on top of that
Don’t go"
"So good, going back for more!","Had the #8 & #9 galettes and they were splendid! Definitely going back for more, looking forward to the second outlet!"
Our Crêpe & Galette Go To in Singapore,Consistently great food and super friendly service. Love the galettes - remarkably authentic especially with the french ciders.
Garden restaurant & Good service.,"Fabulous service , Classic burger & Galette is delicious & juicy, the ambiance is like in a small garden,definitely will visits again with my friends."
"Good service , coffee","Galette was really authentic, Ambience is great Had good experience for brunch, highlight the service team, recommended the coffee."
Sunday Brunch Munch,"Visited French Fold for Sunday brunch. First time here and it seems like a very popular place hence we joined the SMS queue registration system and was seated within 10 minutes. Beautiful and cosy interior easily attracts onlookers walking past. 90 minutes’ dining duration is reasonable to catch up over a meal.

Clueless on what to order given the variety of options but we were promptly attended by Shafiq who gave us recommendations which we decided to go with.

Had the No. 4 and No. 12 galettes, homemade fries, no. 15 crepes and two specialty coffees. I love that this place offers food different from other cafes with a wide variety which makes you want to return to try the others in the menu.

Throughout the dining we were engaged in casual conversations with the warm and attentive staff especially Shafiq.

Looking forward to return! Thanks for the food and hospitality."
Lovely,Visited during off-peak hours. Nice ambience plus friendly crew. Looking forward to trying other dishes on the menu next time.
Best cheese platter,"Best date birth ever , Shafiq and Brian were the best host and the s cheese platter and the impossible burger was amazing , highly recommend the splendid candour 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰"
Something new,"First visit and first time eating this kind of food. Couldn't even read the menu, just anyhow humtum, after ordering didn't know what to expect. How to classify people like me? Probably super-illiterate ?

Ordered no. 5 - Chorizo, organic egg ... and no. 10 - wild trout, leek fondue, lime. No. 5 was too salty and luckily no. 10 was not bad. Food was served pretty fast and good service from the staff."
A bit of France in Singapore,"Wow, our first crêpes since we visited Paris 4 years ago where we fell in love with them.
Excellently prepared, attentive service and a good ambiance made fir a wonderful setting.
Enjoy the french ciders! And either come hungry so you can enjoy 2 or go for sharing."
Great brunch spot,"Extremely popular with the brunch crowd! We got the trout & leek and chorizo & comte galettes and liked both. The galettes look deceivingly small, and you may be tempted to order sides, but they were more than enough for the two of us."
Excellent service and food,We are served and ushered in by Jasper and a gentleman in blue shirt.. Comfortable and good ambience eating here.. Great service and the food is yummy..
Service & Food,Fantastic service. Love the wine recommended by Brian The OM brian. Will definitely come back again.
Food and wine recommendations,Great service from Bryan and he is so helpful in getting us a table and food and wine recommendations. Will visit more often.
Wednesday night dinner and drinks after work,"The best service in town. They know exactly what you want. Will definitely come back again! :) Thank you, Brian, Shafiq and Jasper <3"
Excellent food and service all around,"This place is unbelievably popular and difficult to get an ideal lunch slot -- but then again, I guess people could've been just dying to dine-in at restaurants again, after the latest Covid restrictions.

Finally managed to get a reasonable lunch slot timing, and when I showed up for my reservation, they did everything right. Had me check-in for SafeEntry, checked my vaccination status, and showed me to a cosy table for 2 in a corner. Not the best table in the restaurant, but it was acceptable anyway.

My friend was late, and I ordered for both of us first. The server was friendly and quick to answer any questions I had about the menu. While waiting for my food, the table for 4 next to me cleared, and shortly after my food was served, I was approached to ask if I'd like to shift to that larger table. Since they asked, I accepted, and I was very pleased with the offer -- and with the larger table! Really appreciated their excellent service here.

The galettes are really nicely done and delicious. We had a sweet crepe as well, and the Valrhona dark chocolate crepe was amazing. My friend and I also tried some cocktails in the menu, but sadly, I found their cocktails a little lacking. Hardly tasted any alcohol in it, really; it just seemed very light, even a little watered-down.

So, galettes and crepes, strongly recommend. Alcoholic drinks, not so much."
"Phenomenal crepes, warm and friendly atmosphere.","Visited the French Fold on a Sunday morning, walked in and got a table after a 10 min wait, do keep in mind and make a booking to avoid disappointments. Witnessed many being turned away for not having a reservation.

The brunch menu is pretty extensive, and the crepes are really well executed, given that my library of crepe experiences are rather limited, I would not make comparisons to more notable establishments.

The prices of the crepes are rather fair, given the location. And the coffee options are rather plentiful, with the French Fold using beans sourced from a notable local roastery, Tiong Hoe. That translated to a rather interesting coffee profile that is unlike other mass distributed brands.

I and my partner ordered a savoury crepe each; the number 4 and 5, respectively, and that was topped off with a dessert crepe, number 20, which came highly recommended by the servers. The portions are reasonable, but if you are a big eater, ordering something that has a larger portion would be required.

Service was warm, and the servers do not hesitate to stop and make recommendations. This is despite a huge crowd and a full house during the time of our visit. This alone would make me visit again, as establishments with warm and approachable service teams are in short order."
Favourite crepe place in Singapore,Love the food here - all the dishes I have tried are delicious although I prefer the sweet crepes to the savory galettes. Warm service and a lovely place to catch up with friends. Will definitely return to try more of the crepes on the menu!
Special French crepes,Impressive and affordable crepes. Cozy atmosphere and friendly staffs. Would recommend to have a try if you want to have some special French cuisine. Remember to reserve online before heading to avoid queuing.
Great food & wine,Delicious wine & food Wine name : La vie En marcel Becase of solo I order the food: Chiffoade of Shaved ham. Gruyere Bechamel
"Opulent brunch, a nice experience","Another quality cafe by Merci Marcel, didn't know of this place until the visit. This place is popular and you need to make a reservation. Though it felt that you might still be lucky if you can get a table by walk in. Nicely decorated with a cosy laid back feel. The main draw point for me was the feature wall that's nicely decorated with plants and has a nice picture. Surprised by the variety of choices, you will be struggling to make a decision on which to choose because everything looks good but you only have 1 stomach. Tried the Chorizo & egg and the mushroom with egg selection, the fold is deceiving because it looks thin but we were full after just 1. Couldn't even contemplate a sweet one for dessert even though that was the original plan. Price point is a little high though, but still a really nice experience. The coffee is really aromatic fragrant."
Nice place and nice food,Nice place and nice food! Thanks Jasper for his warm and patience service all the staff here are so friendly. Althought theres a time restruction for 90 min but overall still strongly recommend!! Have a good day ahead. Cheers 😊
Excellent service,"Excellent service Good food Nice ambience Love da coffee here Came with family, nice place for gathering Definitely will be back"
Great service,Food was awesome and service was superb. Saw my friend's balloon and prepared a special birthday surprise for us!
Nice crepes,"Great atmosphere, delicious crepes, friendly staffs, fair price!!! Highly recommended for chillin. Try the white chocolate crepes !"
Great place to dine in !,Great place to chill and loving ambience! The crepes were excellent especially the ice cream. The staff were heartwarming especially the host Thiru and the server Zhi Jian!
Amazing experience,"Good cafe at Telok Ayer street & authentic ! Galette, Manager and staffs all nice and friendly and warm. We love the ambience & enjoy the Coffee."
Beautiful ambiance& Amazing,"Beautiful ambiance& Amazing food..Exceptional Service & great coffee, We will definitely come back again."
Good food and service !,Overall the food and ambience were excellent ! Would like to compliment Zhi Jian for being attentive and friendly! Would definitely come back in the future !
Excellent galette in quaint setting,"We ordered 2 galettes - ham and sunny side egg and chorizo sausage. Both were excellent - brought back memories of what we had at Montmartre.

The crepe was crispy, the sunny side up was done to perfection, with the yolk completely runny. The balance of flavors was just right.

The service staff were professional and efficient. Thank you!

Will be back!"
They could not wait to get us out of the door!,"The first of us to arrive had to wait a few minutes to be taken to our table and was told immediately that we would have to be gone by 8.30pm. The wine, cider, galettes, salad and crepes were all good with fresh ingredients. The bill was brought to us without asking for anything, they clearly wanted the table and wanted us out of the door fast, as they have 2 servings. In actual fact, we were after an after dinner drink...but that was not an option. My friends and I have agreed that the service was rushed all the way through and we will not pass on the address nor go back. Customer service is an issue. Give it a miss! Plenty of other better places to explore in Singapore!"
"Nice place, good pricing, disappointing crepes","Very nice lay out, with some seats outside to view the crowds. The inside is very inviting, open, airy, the staff friendly.
Coffee came fast and is of good quality. I ordered the chocolate crepes. The pancakes were thick and soggy, tasted like being heated up, definitely not the crispy crepes I expected. The chocolate on top was of good quality. All by all disappointing. I like the place, I will give it another try and let the staff know how I expect my crepes to be."
Yummy galette and crepe,"Specialty cafe with lots of choices for its galettes. We tried number 4 and number 5 (pictured). Number 4 has ham and mushrooms instead of chorizo. For desserts, a 70% Valrhona chocolate and we added a scoop of Hojicha sea salt ice cream. Advise to book as there is a queue even at non peak hours. They will alert you via sms when your table is ready, although there is nothing much to browse in this row of shophouses."
Great place for crepes!,Great place for crepes and buckwheat Galettes! Set in a shophouse with bright interiors. Jasper serving us made some good recommendations.
Nice Food,Great food would recommend to all. Staff are friendly and the price point is not too bad. Savoury crepes were good.
Great food and lovely service!,"Great food. Number 8, 9 and 13 are awesome. Thank you to Jasper for the amazing service! We had a very enjoyable time."
Nice crepes! Great recommendation,Nice crepes! Great recommendation from server jasper lemon butter crepe! We chance upon this place and will come back again with the kids.
Fun casual vibes,"On a busy Friday evening we managed to get a nice outdoor table - thanks to Bryan.
Accommodating us without a reservation.
Jasper is well-versed with his product knowledge and recommended us the popular Galettes according to our preferences. He recalled meeting us on his first day at Merci Marcel.

We couldn't resist the dark chocolate crepe and indeed the best coffee even it was decaf.
A nice place with great vibes!"
