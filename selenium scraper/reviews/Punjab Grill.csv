Lunch,"We been here for lunch and it was a great experience. The course meal cane with a western dessert and they simply replaced with a very tasty and unique badam halwa and really very good. Cannot miss this place for your lunch or dinner. Thanks to their Chef Gorang Anand who made our day special. If you any special request in mind, let him know a day before."
"We had delicious North Indian food at Punjab Grill, Marina Bay Sands. .","We visited this restaurant for dinner .
It's located at Marina Bay Sands Mall ,behind the Chanel showroom.
We ordered Dal Makhani ,Paneer Lababdar ,Veg Biryani ,Bread Basket ,Rasmalai ,Paan ice cream .
Everything was delicious ,same taste as their outlets in India .
The executive chef Gorang Anand was going around the tables and he checked with us also if everything was good. They even gave us a Paan (betel )shot as palate cleanser at the end .

Recommended for authentic North Indian food .Being at the premium mall prices are on higher side . They are planning to come up with Chaat (savouries) ,Pani Puri counters shortly."
Not as good as I remember,"I am conflicted about this one, because the service was fabulous, a team of all male, very professional and friendly waiters.
The three of us each had the set meal. The main course comes as an enormous portion. I did like the berries pulao, tasted fresher than in most restaurants, same with the vegetable side dish. The appetizers seemed a bit dry, like they’d been sitting like that for too long. And we got served one papadam for three people. They did bring a second one on request.
The main issue is that the place is presented as a fine dining restaurant and what you get, IMO, is well executed Indian home cooking. Also found the food a little bland, but perhaps the cuisine they serve is not spicy. We had eaten at Punjab Grill when it had just opened, so a long time ago, and I still remember the food being amazing and innovative. It’s not that anymore.
I do feel, however, that this is true for most places at Marina Bay Sands now - some of the restaurants that were excellent have closed. What’s left is overpriced and underwhelming. Going out for an average meal in Singapore is becoming outrageously expensive."
The worst experience ever in Singapore,"A very bad dinner, we have just tasted few food and paied too much. Disappointed not only for the quantity but also for the quality. A place to avoid!"
Terrible experience,"Feel very bad . When I order my dal makhni, found stone In black dal and it’s hurt my tooth. It was a terrible experience. I feel kitchen should take more attention in such cases. I was feeling excited about this visit before this happened and now, I won’t recommend any tourist to dine in."
"Too costly, poor service","Visited this restaurant for dinner with family. Food okay but extremely costly and poor service. Kept waiting for repeat bread order. Have to call service staff multiple times as they don’t give any attention to guests/ tables. Would recommend avoiding this. Much better options within 2km vicinity with better food, pricing and service."
Wanted a quick bite a d landed in this junk,It is amazing that one can serve such tasteless Indian food inside the luxurious Marina Bay Sands food court. One of the worst possible so called Indian food outlets. What a total waste of time.
Ordinary and way over-priced,We spent $250 on a meal that would have cost maybe $60 in the US. The restaurant was advertised as having very interesting food but only the appetizer was remotely different. We spent $30 for the naan because the photo in the menu looked like it was large and had all sorts of interesting varieties but when it came it was six small pieces of plain naan that all looked the same (nothing like the photo). We asked if we had received the right thing but were assured there were three different varieties in the basket but we could not tell the difference. The main dishes came in fairly small bowls with mostly sauce. OK but nothing special. The rice was the tastiest thing we ate. Don't waste your money coming here.
The most awful experience,"I just arrived in Singapore from the UK and my client from Indonesia said they would like to try Indian food. I have been to this restaurant pre covid as the food was good, so made a booking and had the most awful experience.

The staff were so dis-organised and service was so slow, it's not because the restaurant was busy but just that they were pretty useless. We waited over 20 minutes to get served after the starters finally arrived some 40 minutes later, we decided that we did not want the main course because the service was so slow, to which the waiter said sorry sir the main course has been made and will be with you shortly, it arrived another 20 minutes later, by this time we had lost our appetite and decided to leave, when I complained they just said sorry and still charged me for the main course what was even more frustrating was that the bill had service charge added to it, what an insult to injury.

They did not even give us the water that we ordered, frankly what is upsetting is that no one was in charge to take ownership of the chaos.

This restaurant is located in the famous Marina Bay mall with all the major exclusive brands and the poor service is not worthy of its location."
Good experience.,Good experience. I’m just a little disappointed in the serving of their butter chicken on their set menu because it was just 5 little cuts of chicken compared with the big chunk of braised lamb but it was tasty. Staff are attentive and nice.
Disappointing and completely ridiculously priced,"Incredibly disappointing experience, food is average and completely overpriced!

$50 for a chicken tikka masala that you get a tastier version in little India for $15!!

Though we were paying for the restaurant experience but service was incredibly lacking!

If you want to go for a swanky curry and starters etc with service to match go to Tiffin Room!"
Gordon Ramsey needs to visit!,"The popodoms were soggy, yesterday's. He claimed that they were made in the morning! Even in the mango season they couldn't make a fresh mango lassi. Non of the food was authentic punjabi. They do not know how to make a proper punjabi partha. They are making indian partha for wimps.
I wouldn't feed my dog this food.
Never recommended. And the prices are even too expensive for Singapore.
Absolute rip off. And trying to compete with Gordon Ramsey restaurant.
Asked the manager if Gordon had been in, couldn't even understand the question. Total fool.
I think Gordon needs to feature this on his Kitchen nightmares!"
An absolutely disappointing meal/ punjab grill- Singapore,"Last evening we dined at Punjab grill - Singapore. It was really so so disappointing with the extremely poor service & a bit unhygienic too!
The food was definitely not like the Jigs Karla standard at all ! Very mediocre! I don’t think you should waste your money ! This was hardly a Fine Dinning Resteraunt experience
There are simpler & better North Indian restaurants in little India !"
It’s no more a celebrity chef restaurant,Visited 4-5 times in the past before covid. Now it’s like any other normal restaurant With prohibitive price tag. Avoid this restaurant with out any second thought
Disappointing experience. Will never visit again…,"Restaurant had a stinky smell of stale food. There were broken glass pieces and straws under the table. And, food tasted average.

No way we can associate “fine dining” with this restaurant.
We went there for a special occasion and our experience there ruined the day."
"Portion too small, taste normal, overpriced","The food portion was too small. Left the restaurant looking for more food
$50 for a small bowl of fish curry with low quality fish used
$36 for 6 pieces of brocolli???
$30 for bread basket. Just 6 pieces of normal plain tasting naan???
Overpriced, small portions, average taste.
The indian coffeeshop at the neighbourhood corner has better curry.
The restaurant is also not part of MBS rewards, no points or 10% discount for using standard charted unlike other restaurants at MBS."
Disappointing Experience,"Went for my Bday celebrations on 26th Sep, 2021 with 4 other friends and had a horrible experience there. I've been here multiple times before and have always loved the place but this time the service looked completely at a loss !

Tequila shots were served without lemons and salt, Dahi ke kebabs were served without any chutney, Gin and Tonic was served how its served in a food court or any regular place with Schweppes Tonic can as mixer served separately while charging a bomb for the same !

Punjab Grill is supposed to be one of the finest fine dining places in Singapore for Indian food and this time it was a big big disappointment ! I had taken the group there talking so highly of the place but it was sheer embarrassment for me.

Hope you can maintain the high standards that people go there for !"
"Very good food, nice quantity. Loved it","We visited Punjab Grill at Marina Bay Shoppers while on staycation. We were greeted with a complimentary dhokla piece. There was also a Khakra and 3 chutneys on the table. This was a mix of spice, tangy flavous.
For starters we had soya chop. It was nicely done. Soft with chutney on top and also some leafy vegetables.
Main course was Paneer Lababdar with butter Naan and Tandoori Roti. Veg Dum Biryani was our preferred rice dish. The Paneer Lababdar was quite flavourful. The kids enjoyed the Naan and Roti. The Biryani was very tasty. Right mix of all the spices served with Raita. All the dishes had good quantity. We enjoyed all the dishes. Definately one of the better places to try Indian food. The prices are on the higher side but I don't mind revisiting for some special occassions. The ambience of the place is decent. It felt bit dark. There were many ingradients stacked on the wall in small bottles.
Overall it was a very good experience. Most importantly we enjoyed our food. The service is good."
Arrogant Unpolished Customer Service,"Food nothing special, can easily get better ones elsewhere. Chance upon PG while in the Marina Bay area with some friends and decided to give it a try.
The Manager (or is it Waiter) at reception asked if we had reservation saying they are quite booked up. We asked if they take walk-ins. He raised his voice and very rudely asked us twice again if we had reservation pretending not to understand us. Almost going to change our mind to dine at other MBS restaurants, I asked if he wants our business. Only then he said ""walk-in ok"" . So he understood what is walk- in after all.

He led us to a table for four. We were put off by the ""cleanliness"" inside the restaurant. Multiple oily fingerprints were on the dinning tabletop and glass wall of the kitchen.

Anyway, food was very average, and, we will never be back at PG again. There are many good restaurants in MBS more deserving for our patronage."
Food on table cannot be taken away it is reused😐,"Just had a shocking experience at Punjab Grill Marina Bay Sands.
We requested the for leftover food( biryani) on the table to be taken away. We were told food from set lunch cannot be taken away . Here comes the punch , on asking why the waiter told they reuse food from the table . The restaurant needs to be audited for their food practices .
Don’t think I will be going there again ever.
In the end they did parcel my food though after permission from the chef"
"Great food , wonderful service & ambience !","Love the food, love the service! Thanks Chef Javed for preparing such a scrumptious meal for us. I have been to Punjab Grill a few times, and each time, I am amazed by the quality and standard of the food ! For sure I will be back again soon."
Very Average restaurant... what is the fuss all about?,"I heard so much about Punjab grill (PG)...finally I happen to go and dine there last week 2 times. First impression- Interior is just like any other Indian restaurant, very average. I did not like the ambiance at all. Glass ( near the kitchen door) was dirty with thousands of hand prints. Also the kitchen (Tandoor) glass had food marks. Just beside PG there is DinTai Fung, please check out the neat & clean kitchen, crystal clear glass panes through which we can see the kitchen. 2nd - food is also very average. Nothing so special. We ordered kebab platter, mutton rogan josh and butter chicken. Curries are very average in taste. However, I liked the mango sweet jam (condiment), overall kebab platter was good, especially chicken in kebab platter was very juicy and cooked to perfection and loved the dessert- Paan (beetle leaf) flavoured ice cream. 1st time when ate the ice cream I really loved it. The base was orange coloured coconut mukhwaas (minty grated coconut mouth freshener) with Gulkand (dry rose petals with sugar syrup) on top of each ice cream scoop. There were 3 scoops in one order. I loved the flavours very much. I never had something like this before. I returned very next afternoon for Paan ice cream and asked whether we can just have ice cream, the waiter told me the kitchen is closed, they can do only take away. When I got my take away pack there was no base, no gulkand. I had to ask for it. Without the base and topping the flavour will not be the same. I was really not happy with their attitude of cutting corners and not letting us sit for dessert. I don’t think kitchen is needed for just dessert. I could see there were empty tables and there were quite a few customers still eating their lunch. Then after two days we went for lunch again, when we ordered Paan ice cream they changed the base to crushed walnut. First of all they didn’t ask for any nut allergy. I had my 7 year old with me. I had to ask for change again. There is no consistency in the food preparation. The main server was so cold, not welcoming, he was so indifferent... he saw us 3rd time in 4 days. I am super disappointed with the hospitality too. Overall if you want to have set lunch it’s ok to go but overall my experience was just like any average Indian restaurant. I would not recommend to my friends for any special occasions."
Food was ok - but unprofessional service,"Food was ok - but the “manager” seem rather inexperienced and unprofessional - no recommandation, flip the bread of the biryani on my lap... mistakes happen, but then a second time, tried to do something else and splashed sauce and rice on the table, shirts and else...of course no apologies ...
oh and by the way - the menu they advertise online was “not available” ... well but the price stay the same - so rather pricey for ok Indian food ... there are plenty other good restaurant in Singapore but not this one ..."
Punjab Grill,The food was excellent and so was the service a special thanks to Simran for making a lovely experience.
Anniversary Dinner,"Usually a great place to be though Paani puri this time didnt match upto Punjab Grill standards ..

Service is very good. Simran in particular was great.

The fillers in between like Khopra Dhokla with thai sauce was awesome ..

Overall a good place to be but need to maintain the quality in each dish .."
BREAKING NEWS FOR ALL INDIAN FOOD LOVERS: PUNJAB GRILL NOW DELIVERING TO YOUR DOOR STEP!!!,"It has been tough staying indoors for the past several weeks and with Punjab Grill closed we were left craving top quality Indian food. Tried ordering from several other restaurants but were left with bad taste or a stomach ache!

If you are looking for the hands down best quality Indian food in Singapore call them for a take away or order by Grab"
Family dinner,"Nice ambience with friendly staff, was a one time visit as we did some shopping along the way. Food was alright and not that spicy, still acceptable for almost anyone."
THE GREAT INDIAN RESTAURANT 👌👌👌,"I visited last Month this restaurant its nice Indian restaurant in Singapore food was Amazing,service was superb, our server (MAHESH) had great knowledge, he suggested us some very good dishes which were really nice. we are very happy with his service and food overall it was GREAT experience Ambiance is also good, I strongly recommend this place for INDIAN FOOD LOVERS."
We had good time,"This is the first time we visited , we tried Executive Veg Set lunch ,the food was tasty & well presented ."
Sub-standard,"Came Singapore on honeymoon and booked this place as reviews were good.

Food was nice clean and contemporary twists on otherwise traditional Indian dishes.

Would recommend to all but nothing to write home about. I think they need to concentrate more on flavour rather than dressing of the plate.

Otherwise a nice evening meal in marina bay sands. Could be better signposted had to go underground then back up to 3rd tower also some retail staff had never heard of it when we asked for directions.

Do research before hand and arrive early to walk through to get to restaurant."
Great example of good honest Indian food.,"We tried the Panjab grill for the last month and the food was great, freshly cooked very tasty and well presented. Specially lamb chop, Nalli gosht preparation. Mr.Mahesh was attentive and service overall was very nice. Thanks you. Panjab grill team."
"“Excellent experience, Helpful staff""","My recent experience in Singapore has been blissful! Special thanks to the courteous staff at Panjab grill! The food was absolutely marvelous and special thanks to Mahesh who suggested delicious food from the menu

They have starters and the main course to try out and they all are super tasty and so had the Lamb chop and also had the murgh Tikka and these both starters were excellent and it had great taste"
MAHESH AND HIS COLLEAGUES ARE SUPERB!!!,If you are looking for a top experience in Indian food head straight to Punjab Grill! They have a wide variety of dishes and the food is always fresh!
Truely Enjoyed...!!,"Visited here for dinner with colleagues,decor was indeed good with fascinating menu choices with most happening taste and flavours which was followed by great suggestion by the Service Staff Mahesh great skills and Proactive. Great Experience and Highly recommend too....👍"
outstanding service and great food quality,"I frequently visit Punjab Grill for Business/Personal dining occasions. Visited twice in last one month; should say

1) Food quality is really good
2) Set lunch menu is very filling
3) Staff service is outstanding (Thanks to Ramesh and his staff for non stop commitment to ensure customer is well taken care of)
4) Surely recommend anyone craving for Best Authentic Indian cuisine in Singapore"
"Fantastic food, service can be improved","Had dinner with my husband during our Christmas and New Year vacation, food was excellent but the waiters looked a bit flustered and not very organized although very nice and friendly. I would definitely recommend but hope the management gets more organized."
Disappointing - I won’t be back,"I ate here twice on business 18months ago and the food was superb. I brought my family back tonight and sadly I have to say my experience tonight was poor and disappointing.

The starters were excellent. The bread was excellent but the Lamb Rogan and Sheesh Kebab were fat too spicy. I don’t mean too hot, just too many over powering spice, I think cumin but I’m no expert.

One meal was removed from the bill but that’s not the point, This is an expensive restaurant, I don’t mind that but the food has to be superb also, tonight it was not.

I won’t be back."
Pleasing Punjab Grill!,"The suave and indomitable Travelling Gourmet TM goes to the Punjab Grill in...

MARINA Bay Sands. Arguably the best Indian restaurant for fine Indian cuisine in the modern style in Singapore. Spacious and warm with test tubes of the myriad spices in Indian cuisine decorating the walls. Try the stimulating and unusual spicy Guava Cocktail with Cumin and Chilli!
Tikka, Barramundi and more...
Tasty grilled Chicken Tikka with aromatic perfumed Truffles that you can smell...as the dish is on its way to you, is outstanding. I love it! Lamb Kofta and tender, moist Barramundi Fish Tikka are superb too. Squeeze some fresh lemon juice on it and enjoy!
I love to savour the dishes with Garlic Yoghurt, Sweet Mango Chutney and Mint Sauce.

Beautiful Butter Chicken

I find the sexy, luscious Butter Chicken and appetising Dum Biryani simply irresistable. The sauce for the Butter Chicken is just perfect in taste and texture. Enjoy with fluffly, slightly chewy piping hot Naan bread! The Dhal Makhani is also excellent with the lentil seeds cooked until they become mushy.

Dum Biryani from the days of the Moghul Empire is served in a big bowl covered with a chappati. This melange of yummieness has lovely chunks of tasty chicken, plus flavoursome herbed Basmati rice with fragrant spices and caramelized onions. Basmati rice is much more healthy than Jasmine rice due to its lower Glycaemic Index.
For a sweet finale...
Savour Dessert of Alphonso Mango Kulfi and Lychee Milk Pudding. Kulfi is like the Italian Semifreddo and is like ice cream. Guten Appetit! Dr. Michael Lim The Travlling Gourmet TM is a well known INternational Travel, Food and Wine Writer"
Overpriced salty food. Ridiculous to pay $10 for a garlic naan. POOR VALUE. AVOID,You are better off going to Little India for good value Indian food. The Tandoor in Holiday Inn Cavenagh Road consistently serves better food. My guest and I were very disappointed with the Punjab Grill touted to be a gourmet style Indian restaurant. The butter chicken is unremarkable and so was the spinach - both were salty. I would NOT return
Culinary Haven - Punjab Grill,"Culinary Haven - Punjab Grill

Visited with Family as I wanted them to experience something more than just any Indian restaurant — so could not think better place than Punjab Grill

Had heard a lot about the Set menus & the presentation & could not wait to savour it.

We had the 5 course degaustation menu. I’m also glad that they accommodated my special request for light & Healthy meal for one of us.

We went on an Food Fair and were all stunned to see the presentation & way food was platted.

Our lunch was full of amazing flavors & good spread of dishes.

Beverage-selection was impressive as well; some of their in-house cocktails are must-try.

Over all we had a amazing time!
Thanks to the team for The Food & Hospitality!

Specail thanks to Chef Javed & Team for taking care of the healthy menu items!

Look forward to coming back here soon!

Thank you"
upscale elevated modern indian food,"This place was fancy and had elevated modern dishes for your palate. The starters were great as well as the spinach dish. Food was delicious, definitely a place to visit."
Best North Indian food in Singapore,"I celebrated my birthday here, a huge surprise. We really enjoyed our lunch here. We love Indian food, but our lunch served here was something that I haven’t tried before. The starters, the main course, the non-alcoholic beverages and the cake I got - everything was just super yummy! We got this very delicious fluffy starter. Don't know the name, but it was super potato-fluffy-ish with tamarind chutney. Different, but really tasty.

Our starters were a Veg Platter of kebabs. Soooo yummy. Paneer Tikka Multani, Dahi ke Kebab, Tandoori Broccoli and Lahore Shammi Kebab. I liked them all, but the Dahi ke Kebab and Paneer Tikka Multani were the best
And then, the main!! My main was a selection of bread with Paneer Tikka Lababdar (the curry on the right). This is one of the restaurant's specialities, and as I haven't heard of this version of paneer gravy/curry, I therefore tried it. OH. MY. GOD. One of the best curries ever! Sooooo mouthwatering. Even really good with any kind of bread; I got both paratha, garlic naan and plain rotti. So yummy! I'll try this combination again next time I go to Singapore :) I had a Shikanjvi drink, and this was so good. The taste was amazing and refreshing

If you are in Singapore, please try this place!"
Awesome food as well as 5* Hospitality by Anarul_(Staff),"This was my 6th visit, i am already a fan of punjab grill as you won’t get such kind of flavors and food quality across singapore. I tried executive set lunch during this visit, which is also a 5 - course set, where different varieties of signature recipes handcrafted by chef is presented reflecting true flavors of north indian cusine. Hospitality is great here as usual, punjab grill knows well how to frame a memorable visit of their diners. Heartly thanks to Anarul (staff) for a great hospitality and friendly service :)"
Excellent meal,"Really great meal and service. Like everything near the Marina Sands it was expensive but at least the food and service was excellent. If basic Indian is what you want, the food court or the Hawker centers are better but for upscale Indian, really great."
Best dinner with my parents,"As my parents was in Singapore for the first time ..when it’s come to have the best Indian food in Singapore then it’s PUNJAB GRILL .., that was my 3rd visit to the restaurant .., and it was really amezing food and the service... thank you very much Chef Javed ,Ramesh sir and the Team for such great experienced"
Miserable staff,"Food was ok but my god I have never seen such miserable waiters ever, it was like you we were putting them out by being there.

The minute we walked in our waiter had an attitude, my wife and I just couldn’t figure out why. I then observed, he had the same attitude with all the other Indian customers that night.

This restaurant must be sick is serving tourists."
Anarul,Would like to write this review to compliment on anarul good service. It was a delightful experience dinning there if not without the service anarul.
"Great Indian food, recommended by those who know.","I was recommended Punjab Grill by visiting Indian colleagues, and we were not disappointed. Excellent food and service. Good sized servings. Fresh ingredients. Recommended."
Came for the Butter Chicken and got much more!!,"This place has it all from ambiance, service to its amazing food. The Butter Chicken was the best I have ever had and the service was top notch. I enjoyed the food so much I stopped and thanked Chef Javed for making such a great dinner. I encourage anyone that wants a great night out to try this venue. AMAZING!!"
Indian food needs to be at punjab grill,A 13 course menu along with true and genuine hospitality from Javed. If this doesn’t deserve michelin then who else ... hats off
Amazing Experience thanks to the team,"I’ve been to multiple Punjab Grills, especially in India and I have to give it to them - the service and food is consistently amazing throughout. However my experience in the Singapore branch was especially wonderful because of Chef Javed and his team. The food was served promptly and every item was amazing - especially the lamb chops and the foie gras with mango chutney on a bed of tikka Masala. What a dish!!! Kudos to Chef Javed and the entire team who made us feel at home. Will definitely be back soon!"
A memorable event where good food & ambiance connects.,The ability to provide alternate solutions on the fly is indeed laudable. My guest was elated with both the service and the atmosphere.
"Dinner @ Punjab Grill , Singapore","Great food , great service , great staff.
Its expensive!
But once in a while it's nice.
Its located in marina bay sands south podium. The staff were very cordial and soft spoken. The ambience is also quite nice. Got a nice table for 6 of us. A reservation before going in would be nice to do.
Buffet also available."
Excellent restaurant,"If your are in MBS and cravingnfor indian food, this is the best option available. I just love their wide spread menu and the service is excellent."
Lovely setting for a business lunch,"The location and interior of this restaurant is hard to beat. Beautifully furnished and crisp white linen. The food was great, and the wait staff professional. The service could have been a little faster given we all had to get back to work, but I would still recommend it."
Best North Indian Restaurant with Nice Ambience,"Punjab Grill is a best place for delicious North Indian dishes , breads & Biriyani, since we are their regular customers, we clearly can see the improvements & update on menus and their services. Their service personals are really professionals, they keep eye on smaller things as well. Restaurant’s ambience is nice and it’s throws lights to our Indian culture and tradition too, that would help other nationalities to become more curious on India.

Punjab Grill is the best place to arrange events or business meet ups like for lunch or dinner, their location also really convenient."
Best Indian restaurant,"I love the ambiance, decoration and mostly the food. Chef Javed & his team churn up such fusion surprises. The food here is excellent. No regrets A must go to restaurant if you are in Singapore"
Best and authentic Indian food in Singapore,"Authentic North Indian Food with great hospitality and service. As Usual i always 5 Course set menu so can experience the food from soup till dessert. Punjab Grill is the best north Indian food restaurant on island which never compromise with flavors and service. This time it was my 5th visit and it was a wonderful experience as always.

Here I would like to take an opprtunity to compliment the person named “Anarul” our helper of the dinner. He served very well and nicely answered all questions and showing a great care by introducing the food and his other offerings and services. 5/5 Hospitality and care for guests. Worth to visit. I hope I always get him to help me in my upcoming visits to this restaurant."
So much money spent on less than average food.,"Extreme let-down in terms of food quality for a restaurant that claims to be a top tier Indian restaurant in Singapore. The mushroom dish we ordered had canned mushrooms - bland and flavorless!!! Gol gappa used those ready-made puris which you can buy off the shop... The food was extremely overly priced and nothing you couldn't get from the many restaurants in Race course road. have been here a couple of years ago, when it was still good, but the quality of the food has plummeted.

Although the waiters and their service was remarkable, if you want good quality food, please choose better restaurants.. and be prepared to fork out at least 60 to 80 dollars person."
One of Best Northern Indians in Singapore,"It’s unfortunate (for the owners) that this is located at the relatively-lower-traffic end of the mall, for in my opinion this is one of the best North Indian restaurants in Singapore, in the same category as Rang Mahal, Yantra, and Song of India. The lamb dishes are especially succulent - be it the lamb chops or the Nalli biryani. Surprisingly, the breads are not so good. Proactive and knowledgeable service. Pricey (count on $80 per pax without booze) but worth it."
Worst Indian food ever,"Strongly discourage to eat at this place, the price you pay for a five star dining experience, but servers don’t even know etiquettes to serve the food, while serving soup it was dripping everywhere on table.
Now to food, highly overrated food for premium price, Singapore food courts serve good quality Indian food.
Overly spiced food.
And moreover you feel the spice powder which is not cooked properly.
Save hard earned money."
Good food and service,Tasty food and nice presentation. Limited choice for pure vegetarians. Overall service is good. Relatively expensive even for those earning in dollars. One must try this restaurant when in Singapore
Nobody should pay this much money to be sad.,"While there are many words I could use to describe Punjab Grill. I’m going to say only this: Punjab Grill is a bad restaurant.

The POOR SERVICE from staff. All of them seem annoyed at having to be there. Our choice of sitting outside was denied, simply because putting all customers in one corner is easier for staff to bring food. Staff avoid eye contact with customers. A lady said “excuse me” five times at entrance to finally get their attention to get in. The atmosphere is unsettling.

The FOOD is dreadful. It lacks of common sense - they can’t even get basic dishes right. The restaurant’s lamb chop was disturbing. The overdose of spiece was sickening.

The restaurant is soulless and overpriced, but more significantly, “Nobody should pay this much money to be sad.”"
"Excellent food, Slow service","We dined here last night when we were at the Marina Bay Sands . There was no waiting and we were seated immediately. Lovely ambience . Didn’t have a large appetite, so we ordered entrees and skippe d starters . But we were given a beautifully plated potato patty as complimentary starter and also papads to go with it. Our palak paneer and breads were perfectly done and delicious, food was non greasy and not heavy too. The complimentary paan shots at the end of the meal was delicious too. Would have given a 5 star had the prices been wallet friendly. I understand it’s fine dining, but the menu is pricier than Michelin starred Indian restaurants in SF.
Waiters were friendly but slow to get us started and checked out."
Excellent meal,"Had lunch today. Had a real wholesome and wonderful lunch with family. Maintaining highest standard of taste, variety and hospitality. Must recommend for the best Indian meal in Singapore. Great experience. Value for money."
Disappointing,"Wanted to go there with a friend during my visit to Singapore and picked this place due to its location. However, everything else was disappointing. Location is great as it is located inside the MBS, however for someone like me who lives in Dubai, this was more like a restaurant in a mall. Post being seated and with less than 25 customers in total, the wait to order a wine was too long. Waiters ignored you unless you pro actively looked around for them. Once food was served, the waiters don’t come and assist with the serving unless you ask. For a restaurant that charges a high price, I felt these small things were disappointing."
"Avoid for Business Dinner, Terrible Service","Service was just terrible. Beer and cocktail glasses were constantly empty and no one came to offer another drink. Despite that, we ordered a total of 7 drinks, not including another 2 bottles of still water. We had to signal the servers for another drink every time. One of the beer was stale and without any bubbles and we had to ask for a change. When we asked the server to check the expiry date on the bottle, he pretended it is not printed on the bottle and only on the carton. We all know for a fact that each bottle has the expiry date printed.

The worst was when I (being the host) asked for the bill, the server walked past our table and just dumped the bill folder on our table (opposite myself and beside my guest) WITHOUT STOPPING and any eye contact. My guests were looking at me in surprise.

We paid $470 for 4 main courses (Lamp chops, Pineapple Tikka, Chicken Tikka & Prawn Tikka). Naan is $10 per piece. Kingfisher beer is $20 per bottle while Corona is $18.

This is an expensive place and I have no problems paying these prices. But the service definitely does not justify this kind of prices. To be honest, they made an embarrassment out of me as the host. I would not return and would not recommend this place to anyone.

For the food, the butter naan was undercooked as the centre of the naan was still raw and very chewy. My Indian guests rated the food as average only. Because of the high prices and poor service, I would rate this place as Terrible instead of just Poor."
Just okay,I cannot fault the service at all. Timely / pleasant staff / efficient; everything that you’d want. The food was nothing more than okay for the price your going to pay.
Great experience. Outstanding hospitality.,Had a great dinner. Food was fantastic from start to finish. The amazing service provided by Ramesh and his team was the icing on the cake. Will be back soon. Keep up the great work.
Disappointed,"We’ve eaten here many times and decided to take friends as we enjoyed it so much. The menu had changed and some items were not available. The food is still very good but what is disappointing is the prices seem to have risen to ridiculous prices. $28 for a small bread basket. I ordered the mixed grill at $48. It consisted of 4 tiny pieces of lamb and a lot of sauce. The buttered chicken had only a few pieces of chicken and mostly sauce and same for the fish dish. The whole meal came to over $400 and we only had water with the meal. The wine menu now has silly prices for its wines. Very sad. Grossly overpriced for a few bits of meat and mostly sauce. This restaurant used to be excellent value for the high quality food. We did mention this to the staff, but even more disappointedly they didn’t care. We shan’t go again. I can only Decatur as a rip off now. Shame."
Nothing Punjabi about this one,"They need to make a complete makeover and up gradation of the restaurant . The ambience is gloomy . The Punjabi , spicy flavor is missing totally , the veg platter was a disaster , all the chutneys are sweet . The only good part was the naan ."
did not disappoint,have eaten here before so made sure to visit this place again and yes this place does not disappoint you > only issue they do not have a good variety of cocktails but no issues as they served me a nice one though> my wife only wanted to have vegetarian but when i tasted the chicken tikka i asked her to take a bite and you know what shoe took one full piece and such tikka have not eaten such a good one anywhere else > the other food what we ordered was ok little heavy on taste overall good food worth a visit
Disappointing experience,"Ate here last week during our stay in Singapore. We chose this restaurant for a special occasion as the reviews we had read seemed on the whole pretty good and the menu looked very nice. However I am sorry to say I left feeling very disappointed on the night.

When we arrived I was quite underwhelmed by the restaurant itself as it was very small and lacked atmosphere.

We perused the menu and the waiter came to take our order. I couldn't believe it when the first 3 starters were not available that day. In all 4 starters and 2 main courses were unavailable which for a restaurant of this ones reputation I find unacceptable. We ate at 7.30pm so its not like we had turned up at the end of the night when its more reasonable to accept running out of food. I would also expect a waiter to inform diners of any dishes unavailable when the menu is given out. I was very close to leaving to eat somewhere else but decided to stay.

We decided to just have main courses and the food was nice but no better than I have had at a decent Indian restaurant back home in the uk and I found it very overpriced.

If you are looking for nice indian cuisine you won't be disappointed but I would certainly not go back and wished we had gone somewhere else on the night."
amazing indian food,very nice service and delicious food . non veg kabab platter was mouth watering . very good service and mini appitizer in-between was excellent idea to keep appetite moving . finally kulfi was also very delicious .
Indian Restaurant in Mall,"Very nice mall and a nice restaurant with good but expensive food.Only complaint was that while serving they were very miserly when we ordered Thali for 3 guests.The vegetables etc were tasty,fresh but portions given were so small that felt they are trying to save money."
More smiles please,"Excellent grills! However being in a prime tourist shopping mall , the service could have been better . More smiles, less abrupt clearing and serving of plates would have made the entire experience more pleasant."
Tasty food from Indian kitchen,"We went two times to this restaurant situated in MBS. Really liked food quality and service. Ambience of restaurant is very good. Manager Ramesh is a nice person and guided us very well for food choices. We liked sarson ka saag with bajre ki roti. We also tried Grilled chicken n fish, were marinated very well and get melt in mouth with awesome taste. :)"
"Overpriced, Poor service","We waited to be seated where the notice was, at least three staff members saw us and did not even acknowledge or speak to us to say they are coming or even hold on with an estimated time. Place is ridiculously overpriced, ate at many Indian restaurants around the globe and nothing warrants that price for the food, even if it is in Marina Bay. We were willing to fork out after a long day and would at least expect good service at such prices but they lost our custom and would not recommend based on this experience."
"Great food, fine dining experience!","We were in Singapore for our honeymoon & wife's birthday and we decided to try Punjab Grill as part of her birthday dinner. The place was very nicely decorated (love the ceiling), and the food was equally amazing. The service and food were amazing, we were left licking our fingers. After dinner they offered a paan shot (pallet cleanser) which was nice and refreshing. Will recommend"
Great food and great service,"Some of the best Indian food I have had in Singapore! The gravies were rich but not oily, the food was spicy but not hot and the amuse bouche and the sorbets at the end were the perfect foil. The servers were knowledgeable, helpful and friendly.
had a great time and will definitely go back."
Excellent food superb service!,Went there for lunch for a birthday celebration and were not disappointed. Excellent food and very efficient and prompt service by Akshay and Pranay- we had a really excellent time! They also played some superb songs in the background. We went in for the vegetarian degustation menu and all items were TOP class!
Best restaurant in Singapore,"Not only the best Indian restaurant but also the best overall Restaurant in Singapore hands down!!! No competition for this niche, stylish and fun diner who deserve a Michelin Star and let’s hope they get it soon.

This place offers a fine dining experience with a service standard so high that they make you feel right at home.

My family having been coming here for years and are never left surprised at the quality of service on offer as well as the innovative recipes they serve up - from your traditional butter chicken with naan to an exotic lychee and coconut halwa treat! Not to forget the paan shot which cleanses your pallet after a nice meal

The staff are first class from the world class Chef Javed and the impeccable restaurant manager Ramesh Somani to the entire service team - everyone single one are determined to make your stay pleasant and your experience excite with a “wow factor.

I am truly humbled to have stumbled upon such a fantastic place that we call our second home and will gladly bring all our friends and family that visit Singapore.

Thank you Punjab Grill"
Food &service,"The ambience and customer service is very good. Food is too delicious,and reasonable price ,I really like it and I recommend my Friend s and relatives to try !"
Service,I had an awesome service and food. It’s was fantastic ...well done keep it Punjab grill! I’m looking forward to go again. I’ll tag along my friends this time yeaaaaa!
I wouldn't go to this place again even if they paid me to eat there!,"I am not one for writing negative reviews online as I prefer to pass on the feedback directly to the place and then move on. However, I could not do that this time!
We were visiting friends in Singapore and they suggested that we go here for dinner. Being of Indian background, I generally hesitate to eat out at Indian restaurants because it is such a hit and miss.
Having a child with multiple allergies also means that we are very careful where we eat and we completely understand that some businesses do not wish to take the risk. Therefore, as soon we walked in, I spoke with Varun (a senior staff member) to explain the situation and he was EXTREMELY confident that the kitchen will cater for our child. Given the allergies, we always check a couple of times and each time, he assured us that we will not have issues.
Nonetheless, the food arrived and within minutes, our child had a strong allergic reaction; which is the last thing you wish to see as a parent.
In short, we had a terrible evening but luckily our child was able to feel better with their medication.
I could go on about the poor service, terrible communication between the waiters and the kitchen but I hope you've got the picture by now.
Most importantly, we walked out hungry and the bill for 2 entrees, 3 beers, 1 cocktail, 1 soft drink, 2 mains and 5 naans was $453 sgd...I almost had a heart attack.
Of course, no one forced me to eat there, but I would expect to have paid less and got significantly better quality at Gaggan (Bangkok) or any other 1-2 Michelin star restaurant. Plus, there is nothing unique about the food being served here, so how do they justify the exorbitant prices !!!
The chef did come out to apologise; which I am thankful for but I wouldn't go to this place again even if they paid me to eat there!"
Nothing of substance,"Went for a good experience but turned out to be nothing of much substance. Highly overpriced for the food and the quality of food was very poor. The jeera rice was over cooked and seemed like rice covered with ghee with no taste whatsoever. The prawn curry was just so-so with nothing exceptional about it. You expect a lot more from a fine dining experience.

Would give this a miss and rather visit the restaurants in little India or farer park for a better quality food."
Nice indian dining,"1st time had Indian dishes, and actually not bad.
The place very cozy and relaxing, good service.
We ordered
* seafood platter
The food is nice, taste was there however the quality of the prawn need to be improve.
* khadai jeenga - prawn curry
Love this. Perfectly balance, not overpowering each other. Can taste the different mix of the ingredients.
* rasmalai - cottage cheese dumplings. Not my cup of tea unfortunately.
* flat crispy round bread (don’t know what it called) - love it
The crispiness and spices - just perfect. Similar to nachos

Overall was good
Punjab Grill
Downtown, Marina Bay Sands Singapore"
Great tasting food and presentation,I like the food and presentation . I have given 4 stars and not 5 as it is in a mall and there is no view .
Not value for money,"Had expected a lot more from this known brand of fine INDIAN dining place... the set lunch is not value for money ... at best ordinary. The bread choices are not there, they don’t serve the black daal which is quientessential part of a North Indian food in all restuarants... all in all will not recommend atleast going for the set lunches esp. the vegetarian option"
"Excellent attention to detail, fine Indian cuisine.","Amazing wine list, great service, elegantly executed Indian cuisine, something not easy to find in this country. Congratulations to Chef Javed, Ramesh and the team on the stellar operations that you are running."
Awesome food & staff,"I wandered in with two friends on a Friday night, and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff. The restaurant was filling up quickly (it was almost 8:30 pm) but we managed to get a table.

We ordered vegetarian dishes, serving size was well enough 3 of us and the food looked so yummy and it was really very tasty.

The dish I liked the most was daal makhani, I still remember the taste, it was the best amongst the restaurants I visited before. One more interesting thing which I liked very much was Paan shot which is served at the end of the main course.

Very good food & staff. Though It’s bit expensive however worth going for celebrating any occasion and making memorable memories."
Friendly staff and awesome food,"We have been to Punjab grill twice on our special occasions and every time they greeted us Soo well with their friendly attitude and lovely spread of meal which not only looked yummy but tasted delicious. On our anniversary day, the restaurant manager gave us the surprise by bringing on the cake. We really felt Soo good and would highly recommend it to others!!"
RUDE STAFF ...RAMESH SOMANI,"I was with my family for dinner at Punjab grill.. staying in Marina Bay Hotel room 5012 ..

The Restruant was empty , the manager told me to wait ..I was bit surprised.. why I had to wait in spite of Restraunt Empty..I was at Restruant at 9.55 pm and I got my table at 10.10..15 minutes of waiting ( I did not understand the real reason).

When I entered the Restruant I was told that the order will be the final order and they will not take any further orders ( Restruant timings are till 11).

Never the less ..I did not argue with the waiter..

I told him to get me a Bar Menu..he did not got it for 15 mins..A) RESTRAUANT IS EMPTY HE TOLD ME TO WAIT B) WHEN I ENTERED HE TOLD ME ITS LAST ORDER IT WAS HARDLY 10.15 ( RESTRUANT IS OPEN TILL 11) C ) I TOLD THE WAITER TO GET ME A BAR MENU AND HE DID NOT GET FOR 15 MINS)..

Manager ( Mr Ramesh Somani) asked me would you like to order anything else.. I told him I was waiting for a Bar Menu since 15 to 20 mins ..now if i order a drink it might come tommorow...he started yelling on me and started removing his frustration on me by saying "" u have just come and 10 to 12 mins back"". I was bit embarrassed being a customer he is treating like this...People from other table started starring at me.

I am resident of Dubai and frequent traveller to India ( Mumbai) have visited best of restaurants world wide ( Armani of the world )..but never ever seen a manager screaming at customer inspite of his staff fault..it reflects badly on the Management ( are they not trained properly to deal with a customer who is paying 800 SINGAPORE dollars for a night at Marina Bay Sands Hotel)."
Authentic indian grill,"Attended a business lunch with Indian colleagues who knew what to order. Wonderfully spiced food, good selection from various regions."
"Good Food, but Highly Overrated!","We had been to the restaurant for a business lunch and as the menu was pretty confusing, ordered the power lunch. The food was good and tasty and the set meal we ordered was pretty filling, but it is not worth the price. Even as we ordered 2 set meals, we got only the bread basket with one bread and one bowl of the flavored rice that does not taste great. No one comes to ask if you need any more bread or sides. The lime juice was too sugary. You need to have lots of patience to wait for each stuff to come in. The staff seem to be in a world of their own and not bother too much even though it was not full. The ambiance is great with the MBS environment, but it can be lot better with great customer friendly staffs."
Classic Indian,"Went for a business lunch. Did not manage to try the power lunch combo as my associate was not keen. Ended up with assorted bread basket and some kadhai paneer. The breads were fresh and hot while the kadhai paneer was piping hot and tasty. Service was slightly lacklustre and requests had to be made twice or more. However, effort was made and that’s a good start. The restaurant interior is slightly dark and gloomy, perhaps more lighting can be made. Overall a good meal and experience."
Punjab grill,"Very delicious food , beautiful presentation. Excellent service makes me feel very special. Will back there soon again .. Highly recommend ..."
Misbhevaiour by the Manager,"The service in the restaurant was really bad. We had ordered for a basket of papad and it came at the end of our dinner. When we ate the papad, it was not well cooked and wasn't crispy and was smelling. When we called the manager, Ramesh, he didn't have the courtesy to talk properly to my aunt.He crushed this papad in front of us and started to talk very rudely. And the manager of such a well reputed restaurant had the odacity to say ""Please complain, if you want to Mam"""" and also had the odacity to say that it is his pleasure that he is giving us the review card.Such kind of behaviour is not expected in such a restaurant!!"
Awesome food and great ambiance,The brand lives upto it’s name. Food is very good like expected. It really wakes up the taste buds. Portions are big. Presentation is classy and the service is good.
Lunch @ PG,Place for a seven course relaxed meal. Suitable for large groups as well. Plenty of vegetarian and non vegetarian options. Only complaint is you have to repeat every request twice atleast! Great listeners!?
