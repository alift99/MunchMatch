Excellent Food,We come here every time when we want to eat Indian food and the food is so delicious that everyone enjoys it very much.
Pathetic portions,"Ordered lunch a few times. Takes 1 hour for delivering to my location, which is less than 2 kms away. Food gets cold by that time. And the portions are pathetic. Ordered Indo-chinese platter a couple of times, from Copper chimney express (CBD area), to my office near Raffles place - had to buy more food later on, coz the portion is grossly inadequate."
Had a great time!,"Staff are friendly, the ambience is nice. We had a birthday celebration and is able to enjoy our cake and sing a birthday song."
One of the Best Indian Food in Singapore,"We have seen people waiting in queue to go in.. and its a worth the wait. Food is tasty and hot when its served. They pay attention to details and make sure customers are comfortable.

There was a person who decided to sit next to my bench while waiting for his take away... Manager kindly guided him to waiting area.. I really appreciated this gesture."
Delicious Indo-Chinese food,"One of our top places to go for Indo-Chinese food. Am a vegetarian and they happily cater for me. Gobi manchurian, chilli paneer, cheese chilli garlic naan, they are delicious! Must try."
Excellent service by Mari mam and crew,Good choices in menu..quick ordering ..served red hot 🔥 with smile ..tastes great and thoroughly enjoyed the food with good taste and hospitality...kudos to the entire crew and special thanks to Mari mam for handling our group in the best way possible....
"Good ambience, decent food","We ordered the starters gobi and veg manchurian, which were very well prepared and definitely the highlight of our meal. This was followed up by fried rice, chilli chicken, butter naan, and dal makhani. The chilli chicken was a little subpar as it wasn’t spicy at all, and the chicken pieces were small and did not have much flavour. The rice and naan were very good though, and the dal makhani was decent. The dessert of ice cream brownie was also delicious, and the waiter served the hot chocolate sauce over the ice cream."
Copper chimney,"Fantastic food, aircon too cold tho. We ordered their chicken momo, butter chicken, palak paneer, kera fish curry, naan basket, chicken Bryani"
One of the best authentic Indian food in Singapore,"We have been visiting Copper Chimney since a long time and every single time we are treated with best quality and an authentic taste of Indian cuisine. The menu is elaborate and there is something for everyone. My son and I love the Chicken Lollypop and Chicken Tandoori as these are best served at Copper Chimney Singapore..

The staff is very welcoming and are always there at our service.

Its a must visit for not just Indians but all nationality to try some authentic Indian food."
If you in Singapore and crave for Indian food Copper Chimney is your destination.,"A place to visit if you crave for Indian cuisine
While our visit to Singapore we did crave for some good Indian cuisine especially the mughalai. If you love tikkas, kababs, mutton Rogan Josh, Butter Chicken, fried rice the Indian style etc. This is a place to visit at Little India. My favourite was the Mutton sekh kababs, Malai Chicken kabab and mutton Rogan Josh with butter garlic naan trust me it to die for."
nostalgic..,"came to know of copper chimney through an indian client of mine who is living in singapore.. anything you order from kababs to butter chicken to fried rice to milkshakes to dessert, its yum.. whether you crave for mughlai or indian chinese or simply some delicious food, highly recommend it.."
A must visit in Singapore!,"Shopping around Little India and Mustafa, we always land up going to Copper Chimney for lunch. It has become a part of our routine. We went there on a weekday and enjoyed the ambience and food. My top picks are: Butter chicken, Malai Tikka, Gobi Manchurian, Fried rice and Paneer in the Indian Chinese. Mint Calamansi is a good refreshing cooler."
Flavourful and budget friendly. Must visit,"Copper chimney chefs thank you for making proud of the our amazing Indian food, we had visited with family friends from Singapore and they have become a fan of your food. The place to go in Singapore."
"Real ""Indian Chinese"" experience","Superb personalized service (ask for Inder).

Food reminds you of the Indian way of cooking Chinese .
Go for a combination of veg and non veg ; servings are large enough to share. Young children will like Chicken Lollypop
Good for Indian Mughlai too.
We have been regulars for the past 5 years and happy to recommend CC to all."
Deepti,"We loved our time at Copper Chimney. The food, the staff, the ambience, everything was perfect. We had ordered Indian food and it was cooked to perfection. Copper Chimney tops our go to list."
delicious food,The eatery looks posh and clean. the orders were taken quickly. the food arrived a bit late but the meals were worth it. the biryani was delicious. i chose the prawn briyani. there were enough number of prawns for my hunger. i told the waitress that the food was delicious she said she will let the chef know. i was happy that my friend chose a gd eatery for me.
Copper Chimney Review,Very friendly staff with positive attitude. Great food with great service. Could use a reno for better ambience
Good food is the foundation of genuine happiness 😊,"My family and I enjoyed the evening dinner

O BIRYANI.VEG
Kadai Paneer
Butter Roti

The food was awesome, especially the Butter Roti with
Kadai Paneer was so tasty and My kids loved the chicken

Wide variety of foods,"The restaurant is clean, their service is good and and very attentive. There are not crowded during lunch hours, probably still new. Their food is delicious and the portion is big. I love their butter chicken with garlic naan, I can't stop myself from eating. The mutton biryani also not bad. The meat is soft and the biryani is full of fragrant of mutton. We definitely will be back for another visit."
Great foods with good service,"Butter chicken - 5/5 - different than others’, slight sour but great, chicken taste like tikka chicken, excellent

Garlic naan - 3.5/5 - Good that not too try. Looks delicious, but dunno why it doesn’t has typical good garlic taste

Mutton Seekh kebab - 4/5 - not too dry, good to eat with the sauce. Quite good but not really that amazing

Szechwan fried rice - 4/5 - as a fried rice it is quite good, but not yet amazing. Big potion

Masala tea - 2/5 - more like teh tarik, doesn't taste like masala tea

Sizzling brownie with ice cream - 5/5 - served on a very hot plate, a lot of smoke. Value for money for such show and taste"
"Great Food , Great service",We enjoyed very very much the food and the service. Every dish was so tasty!!! And the waiters were so pleasant and helpful!! We'll certainly come again and again.
Customer Service,"Me and my family patronize Copper Chimney on 24 of Dec 2021. The service staff by the name of Saranjeet Kaur served us.

She was very well knowledgeable of the food and recommended certain food which was really tasty and delicious. She even explained to us how the food is being made.

In between our dinner, she even make an effort to come to our table to check on us.

She has a very good customer service skills and pleasant and cheerful disposition."
"Excellent food, professional service","I visited the restaurant with my wife, hoping to fine in, but post ordering, had changed to take out due to a change of plan. The waiters were nonetheless prompt with our food and the packaging was very well done. The food stayed warm even after we got home.

The food itself was excellent. We ordered veg momos, veg manchurian, burnt garlic rice. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The momos in particular were a notch above. The manchurian (in gravy) was soft to just the right amount. Complements to the chefs."
Excellent food,"the foods was amazing, delicious and excellent, for sure to come again in the future with family and friends"
Amazing food and great service,The food's quality and consistency has been good! Highly recommended. Service is also polite and prompt.
One of the best places for Indian food,1. Very good quality of food and hygiene 2. A nice place for lunch/dinner 3 Must try drink Jaljeera 4 portion of food is sizable
satisfied my desire for Indian food,"fuss free and pleasant service, servers are willing to explain about the food when ordering, which is good for those who are new to Indian delicacies. Quite pricey, but proportionate with the food and ambience that you get. You can try Jal Jeera drink to refresh yourself after a hot day with exciting taste!"
Nice,"Been here a few times and have enjoyed the food each time, they have a really wide range of dishes and the food is excellent, the service is pretty good too, will be visiting many times in the future,"
Succulent tender chicken!,"Located opposite the exit of the Mustafa Centre this restaurant was ideal for after shopping dinner.

Nice selection of vegetarian and non vegetarian food with halhal certificate on display. Often for chicken malai tikka starter and chicken labader main course. Delicious cheese naan bread and to finish off pistachio kulfi. Food was excellent, and the chicken in both dishes was especially tender.

No beer - so sad but it’s ok. Water put on table on my arrival and $1 added to the bill. Notwithstanding, I recommend this place - great place for dinner."
Nice Indian Food,This one of the best Indian restaurant in Little India.The restaurant is very clean with nice decor inside.Despite of the prices i would still give five just because of the mouth watering taste and good quality of food along with great service. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
Authentic Indian food in Singapore,"After spending few weeks in Singapore, when I was craving for some Indian food, I found this place. They serve really tasty Kulchas, Kadai Paneer and Dal makhni. Also they served chaats and Pani-puri which is hard to find in Singapore. Although the meals seemed pricey, however they seemed worth going for."
Great food and drink,"We came here after walking around most of Little India and not knowing where to eat, and we thought ""this place looks nice"". The food was really good, they had my favorite, Chicken Lababdar, and I was very satisfied with it. Also try the salty lime soda, it's like an alcohol free margarita, and so great when you've been out in the heat all day, amazing!"
Top notch service from the heart!,"This is a very Long overdue review, as I visited Copper Chimney on 21 Jan 2020 with my non-Indian colleagues to celebrate our colleague’s birthday! I have no regrets in choosing Copper Chimney (Syed Alwi Rd) to celebrate this event, as we were surprised with a huge cake (approx 0.5kg-1kg).. & this surprise was arranged by the restaurant’s management. Thank you! & thank you to the Manager for the lunch hour for accommodating to our requests for preparing our dishes with lesser salt & lessee oil.. my colleagues & I will definitely recommend Copper Chimney to others & return back soon!"
"Tiny portion , Average, Disappointed.","On first impression the restaurant boasts a clean interior. Our two dishes, chicken tikka masala and Kadai Prawns was submerged in heaps of onions and capsicum. The meat portion was so small that it might be sufficient for a child diet but not for a single adult. As we ordered two dishes to share we walked away hungry. At $15 for a tiny portion of meat ( imagine, say 2 inches of meat) is definitely overpriced. Very disappointed.
If you wish to sample their food be certain to check the portion and ask the waiter if a dish is good for 1 adult or 1 child."
One of the best Indian Restaurants.,One of the best Indian Restaurants. Nice and clean. Different from other restaurants close by. Really worth a visit!
Best Indian restaurant in Singapore,This is hands down the best Indian restaurant in Singapore. Every single dish was phenomenal. Johnny the manager was very courteous and made some good recommendations. When in Singapore do try it.
Good Indian Food,"Nice restaurant located in Little India. The menu has many familiar Indian dishes. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Lucknow Murg Korma and Bread Basket. Both the entree were delicious and bread basket had 6 to 7 variety of breads. The food and bread were enough for four people. The service was very slow inspite of the fact that we went late in the evening."
"Great indian-chinese Food , Good Value for Visit","Quite good Indian Chinese food , specifically veg Hakka noodles and chaomin soup , value for money, right place to have alternative to pure Indian food vs Indian Chinese food."
Fancy restaurant,"Walking through Little India we chose this place as it was air conditioned and had modern nice tables rather than cheap tables, it is a little fancy. Food excellent. Fantastic service, 7 waitors for only about 7 tables of diners. Best veg juipuri ever had."
Best Indian Chinese food in Singapore !,"This is our favourite restaurant in Singapore ! The food is absolutely delicious and the service is excellent . Very kid friendly as well and we don’t mind making the trip from East Coast to Little India . We really enjoy their steamed momos, Gobi Manchurian , hakka noodles and sizzling brownie . Great place to be !"
Food indian,We ate here once but did not like it. The price was also very steep for the quality. lamb curry was very spicy even after requesting a milder one
Delicious,"The first truly delicious meal, we have eaten from the arrival (eight days ago). Unlike ""local"" chicken rice and taste-less noodles, that you can get anywhere else. Keep it up!"
Excellent service,I am a frequent business traveler to Singapore. Staying in PARKROYAL is my dream always because excellent service received from Manager Ella. She is doing marvelous job managing my reservations giving early check-in at crucial times always making my business visits more and more enjoyable and hassle free. Thank you Ella your support always appreciated. PARKROYAL always because of your friendly service.
Unpleasant Dinner Turnout,"Visited Copper Chimney on the weekend for dinner with my friend since we were on Farrer Park. The hospitality was pretty alright - staff were attentive to take orders.

However, I requested for ice water, nothing came. There was a bottle of water on the table before you sat down so I assume he was thinking that’s about it. The orders took some time to arrive but well I assume good food takes time, right?

As my friend was a vegetarian, I had the Chicken Tikka Masala to myself. The chicken tasted like it was prepared sometime back and reheated and placed into the sauce. Doesn’t taste really fresh and well marinated into the sauce.

On the next day, I had very bad stomachache and had to visit the washroom on multiple occasions. Would not recommend."
Nice clean Restaurant,"Food is good. Portions are good. If you’re looking for a proper restaurant in little India, this might be the right place for you."
"Good Food and Ambience, The Same Taste Legacy Maintained As In India","Very Hygienic, food tastes better, Only Drawback it is not pocket friendly as compared to other Indian Restaurants in Little India, but at the same time they are charging for the quality of food and taste they Are providing."
"cleaner, better, tastier.. 4.5 ⭐ is an accurate count..","if you can find a a better place in Singapore that serves prawns masala, garlic butter naan, roomali roti and chicken lollipop do let me know.. the staff continues to be as as courteous and soft spoken as before and while I think I saw a few from the previous team, I do miss my old friends from the earlier management.. also they still do not force you to buy bottled water, while the green chutney really needs to be replaced!"
Pleasant,"Good food, nice music, comfortable ambiance and most important very hygienic and clean for restaurant in this area. Service is polite, complying though at times need to get thier attention. Server was friendly and accommodating with special request for extra chutney and customizing order. Overall would reccomend and visit again"
GOOD,Out of other restaurants serving veg food this one is a good option for people looking for indian veg food in little india. Located just opposite Mustafa mall it is a good value for money
Very nice & cozy!,"After seen my friends posting on her visit to this place. I & family booked this restaurant on weekend. When we came, it was lunch time so the crowd is slowly coming in. Was greeted by the waiter and she bring us to our reserved table. Nice ambiance. Cozy feeling with smooth music being played. When choosing the food from the menu, the waiter take her time to explain to us & recommend what is nice. My daughter loves the Butter Chicken, Naan & Saffron Rice. it was very delicious. We also had chicken tikka masala, vege & some starters. Overall experience. Worth it! by far, my 2nd choice after 7spice!"
"Excellent Staff, Delicious Food, Value For Money","We went here twice during our stay in Singapore. It's a very underrated place. Mind you, they serve delicious food and that too, with decent quantity. This place can give run for money to the much over hyped places in Little India. It's located exactly opposite to Mustafa center.

It's slightly cheaper than others around, but the most important factor is value for money, quantity and quality of food. Taste's are authentic. We ordered chana masala, manchurion with gravy and their special burnt garlic fried rice.

The burnt garlic fried rice were superb. So much so, we ordered this twice!

Manchurian was delicious too. Butter Chicken and Naan were finger licking good. Portions are good and we could easily serve 3 people out of it.

Roti Naan and breads are fairly priced when compared to other indian joints around.

Staff is hard working, takes up requests and goes the extra mile to cater to you. I don't know why people do not talk about this place, but I guess this deserves to be in top 3 places to eat Indian food in Singapore instead of the one's that currently hold the spot.

We requested them to fill our bottles with cold water and they obliged everytime we requested them to. These were 2 big bottles on every visit.

The Manager, Randeep (if i am not mistaken), is a very nice guy and can recommend a lot of options they have on offer. He quickly got us Daal Makhni on priority when were ran out of food, but had surplus roti's in the basket. Adviced us what item can take time and what can be done asap.

All in all, we had a very good time here. Enjoyed the meal and savoured on the authentic indian flavours for long time.

Only con, they do not have a bar/bar menu. No alcohol. If they can add up a bar, It should do wonders. We missed beer here.

Certainly recommend to visit this place and see for yourself."
Lunch at copper chimney,"Superb north india food (veg & non veg), good service , nice place as well. It's a little on the expensive side. But quality and quantity both were good. This is located right opposite Mustafa."
Changed menu on return visit,"After an enjoyable meal in this restaurant last November 2018 we headed back for our favourite ""Veg Jalfrazi"". Unfortunately the menu had been changed and although the substitute ""Veg Jaipuri"" was enjoyable it did not match the Jalfrazi. Mango Lassi's at $7.00 are worth the price. Another change was the plastic bottle of water on each table rather than the chilled stainless steel jugs and glasses of previous times. Then I noticed a charge of $1 for ""Mineral Water"" on the bill. Not a huge impost but no mention of the charge before payment. Still a good experience but you pay for it."
Gorgeous vegetable curry,"Service was great and food was amazing. Peshwari Nan particularly tasty. Nice amount of spice in the vegetable Jimlaya (something like that and chef special). Children loved chicken tikka. Very recommended as price £56 including drinks, 4 meals and a bread."
Indian and Chinese Restaurant near Mustafa Centre,"Copper Chimney, located at Syed Alwi rd. The food is bit expensive here and they use same oil for veg and non veg dishes. They serve liquor. Great ambience. Vegetarians should be careful."
Excellent Food,"Very good food and service, a bit high on the price, but justifies the quality of food. Would recommend to anyone visiting Little India area"
Best Indian Food Restaurent,In one word best in taste. their food are so tasty you will not feel your local food is you try there. As a proper restaurant the price bit high but i must say compare to Singapore standard the price is good and the food is delicious. A must try place
fantastic food,The stuffed parathas are especially awesome - you rarely find such authentically and pain-stakingly made parathas even in average restaurants in India these days. Great authentic Indian food and lovely warm staff. Prices very very reasonable. Highly recommend for a casual Indian eat-out.
Filled to the brim,"Amazing food. All the dishes had just the right amount of both cuisines to make it delicious. Food is spicy, which personally is delicious, and the flavours are spot on. My whole family enjoyed this meal."
Excellent Indian,"Located in Little India m an area choked with eateries, this place is well above average. Clean comfortable and modern. Limited menu of interesting dishes. Delicious food and friendly staff. Will eat there again. Try the fish curry!"
A happy Discovery,"We just walked into this restaurant cause we were hungry :) but so happy with the discovery that we went there thrice already in a month's time. Johny at restaurant seems to be running the place and he is doing it wonderfully- he has a warm personality and the team is attentive too. We went there to break our fast once just before iftaar and he brought some dates without even asking for it. Thank you for your hospitality.

We were looking for a place that serves good Indo - Chinese food in Singapore and this restaurant answers that. American Chopsee, schezuan, hakka everything was on point. Also the North Indian food was good. Thank you"
Casual meeting place,"Food was nice. It is Indian cuisine. All recipes are mild.

I went to nearby BFC tower. This restaurant is located in a food court. Finding a seat during lunch time is all depends on your luck."
Always nice,Really great restaurant. Food is prepared fresh and very tasteful. Service is attentive and friendly. The selection is very good and prices are within in the normal range. The inside of the restaurant is very well maintained and clean. I can recommend the Samosa. Really excellent
If you crave Indo-Chinese...,"Indo-Chinese is a guilty pleasure and not something to indulge in if your counting calories! Everything is fried and oily, but still tasty! I don't think this is the best Indo-Chinese place in Singapore, but it's easy to find and get to."
Probably the best Indian food in Singapore,"This restaurant is under-rated. Almost everything on the menu is great. The staff is friendly and the menu is extensive. It’s not fine dining. But if you’re looking for great North Indian food, this would be one of my top recommendations."
Average Indian Food,"Medium size portions . Everything is a little spicy despite the fact they say they will try to tone it down. Do go for the mango lassi, its legit. The cheese naan is disappointing; go for the garlic naan its much better. Would prefer smaller portions ( especially for the dahl) so we can try a variety.
Don’t order more than 3 dishes if you are 2 people ."
Not impressive,"Well, I checked with the waiter if their chicken tikka Marsala was spicy before I ordered. He told me they could make it non-spicy for me, but it was very spicy. I was tired and had no energy to complain. Just finished the rest of the food, paid, and left."
Delicious food!!!,Súper good! Thats the best food then i ate from India! Thank you so much guys! You guys ate amazing!! I will come back
Yummy food with good service,"It's located among street full of restaurants... But I'm sure it's food and service set it apart.
Ambience is simple and nice... For sure can be improved upon.
But food ... No doubt it tastes real good...and appreciate it's been consistent since years.
Their sizzling ice-cream with brownie is star attraction... And sure a must have.
Enjoyed it every time with great service.
Worth your time n money."
Something Different,"Our first night in Singapore, we stayed at close Hotel nearby and walked to Mustafa's.
Found Copper Chimney and, although we don't eat Indian Food, thought we'd try something different - as they say, ""When in Rome, do as the Romans"".
We explained our predicament to our waiter and asked for advice on the dishes we thought we'd try. He was fantastic - confirming chili heat levels.
Food was fresh, tasted great.
Value for money: price was exactly what you would expect from other restaurant in the area. I was happy with value for money."
"Good food, good hospitality","I’m a big fan of food and Indian food ranks much higher than many cuisines in my tally. This restaurant is definitely one that serves authentic North Indian food. The service is also not bad considering we’re in Singapore where the service staff has no extra motivation for tips (since the service charge paid to business is already seen as serving this purpose) so it’s ok.

Try gobhi manchurian, chilli chix, dal makhani. Enjoy!"
No hospitality here!,"So we came to Singapore from India for a vacation, and we used to have our dinner at this one particular place every night (coz the food was ok for our tastebuds and we did not kind of want to take a risk with other restaurants as food was expensive in Singapore). One night we ordered an indian dish that was a complete disaster. We brought it to the attention of the guy who had served it. To our surprise he did not replace it(which is a COMMON COURTESY in every small and big restaurants) just acknowledged our complaint. Later we were billed for that dish which was lying there the way it was served as no one wanted to even touch it! This was really disappointing and upon asking we were told this dish is cooked as per our standard recipe and there is nothing wrong with the dish (plz rework on ur recipe this is not even an inch closer to what the original recipe is like!! ). Being a regular customer for sometime now we did not really appreciate this. We raised it to the main person and he said the next day when we come for the dinner he will replace this dish. But next day he wasn't at the restaurant. We asked the guy who was serving us that night about what the owner had promised us last nite, and he said that person is not present and we cannot do anything about it! We simply paid for our dinner that day and left disappointed from there! 1/10 for this kind of hospitality. All this fuss is not about money but there's something called hospitality which u guys lacked. Seems u care only about money and do not value your customers else replacing one single dish wasn't a big deal! Personally I won't like to visit your restaurant again!!"
Good food,"Located opposite to Mustafa center, it's good option for someone searching for North Indian food. Ambience is good. Crowded most of the time. So it is advisable to reserve seats prior. Moderate expensive, staff were courteous and very helpful."
Good Indian food.,"Tried this place for dinner tonight while visiting little India and Mustafa Centre. We ordered a variety of dishes. The variety platter and minis for entree was very yummy. Had palak paneer, butter chicken and mutton nihari accompanied by garlic nan and Briyani. The main dishes were quite nice. Briyani was a bit bland but ok when mixed with other curries. Overall, good food and I will go back again. Oh don’t forget to the coke jeerali, it’s not on the menu but you can order."
Extremely oily food,"Restaurant looks fine aesthetically. My wife and I got chicken biryani and kadai ghoost. Both the dishes were very oily. To be fair the taste was fine but when the food is in a pool of oil it is not appealing.

Hope copper chimney read this review and use less oil in their food in the future."
Nice and authentic Indian food!!!,"The server and staff was very warm and thoughtful since we were there with our kid, they made extra sure of serving us food on time.Will visit again."
Food was Lousy,"I visited copper chimney on 5th Nov 2018 along with my family members around 8.15 pm and I am completely determined that I will never visit them or recommend anyone to visit there. I never saw roasted Masala Papad in my whole life. The Chily chicken was served without salt. On the top of it, the chicken was served frozen and almost raw stage. Reception counter was almost clueless about what is happening in the kitchen and no sympathy for the Unhappy Customers. Very much careless attitudes. Come on! You are in a Hospitality Business and you don't know how to take care of your customers."
Delicious food and great service,One of the best places in Singapore to have Indian Food. Staff are very nice and friendly. Highly recommend for Indian Food lovers and for sure i will come back again.
"The food was OK, not great!","I went for dinner on a Saturday evening and it was full and I had high hopes. The Copper Chimney is nicer than the majority of Indian Restrauants on Syed Alwi Road, and the air conditioning was appreciated. There is a large menue, the service was good and the food arrived fast. In my opinion, the food was just OK and the price is higher thsn the competion on Syed Alwi Road."
Disappointment as we went to enjoy good Indian food trusting previous reviews perhaps by restaurant stakeholders,"Food quality was very low standard compared to the high price charged. Most gravy are the same and tastes too sweet. E.g. butter chicken gravy and mixed veg gravy. Mutton Rogan Josh also too sweet and had already turned bad. The naan was burnt and they served the burnt part facing down so when we ate it, we realised that is is burnt. Overall, the food does not have the original taste and foreign tourist would get the wrong impression of Indian food."
Amazing Indian Food,"Probably the best Indian food we've ever had. The butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, and veggie korma (which they made special for us) were all fantastic. You can tell they use very fresh ingredients. It was the perfect blend of westernized Indian food and authentic Indian food. Can't suggest this place enough."
Nice food,Nice food - freshly made and good service. I would recommend this restaurant. Reasonable menu selection.
Ok food.,"Had garlic and cheese naans, chicken tikka, palek paneer and mutton. Good but not fantastic. Friendly and clean environment. $14 for the meat dishes, $4.50 for a plain naan and $6 for a cheese naan. Naans are priced on the high side."
Good Indian food and open till late,"Restaurant is located across the street from Mustafa Center in Little India. Came here after arriving late in the city and our hotel nearby suggested to visit the area as there are a lot of late night options here. Street was extremely active and bustling with people visiting the 24-hour shopping arcade. Lot of restaurant options offering mostly Indian food or local cuisine. We went to this restaurant as it had more people sitting inside vs. in other similar restaurants. Definitely a good choice!

Food was served hot and taste was authentic and great. We tried a Chinese starter and traditional vegetarian main course food. Quantity was sufficient and servers were attentive to anything we were asking for. Cleanliness was very acceptable too, keeping in mind the not so clean street just outside.

Good experience overall and definitely a nice find late at night."
Late night dinner,"Had dinner nearly at midnight. It was good, fast service and hot. Only Indian food is good. Eating roti was better than Nan."
Amazing food!,Delicious food and great service. Staff were efficient and friendly. We ended up eating here more than one night it was too good!
"Amazing food, specially indo-chinese","We tried a few starters, garlic naan, lacha paratha, fried rice, gobi manchurian and chilly chicken. We didnt enjoy the chilly chicken and lacha paratha much. Everything else was really good. Price similar to other restaurants in the area.
We had lassi and lime soda which was refreshing.
Brownie sizzler was absolutely yum!
Place was crowded and hence the service slow.
Overall a very good resraurant i would visit again.."
Good food,If you are starving for some good indian food in Singapore then this is the place. They offer you a decent variety of indian food and the food tastes good too. They can work a little on the ambience as i found it very basic. Also as we were seated right next to the door so found the AC lil ineffective because of the doors opening and closing again and again.. so avoid sitting there if you have a choice.
Lovely waitress,"The food was good, place was clean, but we had a beautiful kind hearted waitress from Malaysia that really made my day! She was impressed with my 1/2 New Zealand 1/2 American daughters Bahasa... she said lovely things to my family, and the heart she showed was certainly enough to warrant us. Return visit!"
Fine Dine with Great Indian Taste! Coke Jaljeera must try.,"Good Indian taste. Fully crowded Indian Restaurant in littleIndia. Good service too. Starters and Main course everything had a great taste. Just beware don’t ask them to make anything spicy as they then make it real real spicy...Coke jaljeera was not on the menu but its their popular drink as suggested by a friend...must try! You can ask them to make your breads more crispy though....If you’re seeking good North Indian, you won’t regret going to this place."
Tasty,"A clean place with helpful staff. The food was fresh and tasty. We ordered prawn briani and butter chicken, which were good. But the mango lassie was not the thing we were expecting."
Tasty food,"I visited Copper Chimney restaurant with my family. My wife wanted to have noodles for long time and that's the reason we visited Copper Chimney. After having our food, we were proud to select Copper Chimney. The food taste was awesome. My wife ordered Chicken manchurian and I ordered vegetarian manchurian along with noodles. I was very impressed with the taste of food."
Why Are People Giving This Place High Ratings,"Visiting from the UK and in need of some Indian Food, we came across this place on TA, with the high ratings, we thought we were going to be in for a treat.
I am shocked by the reviews people have given this place. I would certainly not give it more than 2 stars. Waiter was more bothered in serving a group of ladies on another table rather than us. When we called him over, it was like we were wanting something. Food came out in dribs and drabs, about 10 minutes before all meals were delivered. All the food was awful, lack of seasoning and the look of some of the dishes were shocking.
The only time the waiter was efficient, was in getting our bill!

There are many other places around here, do yourself a favour and go elsewhere."
Dinner time !,"Perfect place for North Indian food in Singapore ! If visiting Singapore and looking for Indian food, specifically North Indian - roti sabji tandoori !"
Nice Indian food,Visited this joint frequently during our stay. Very authentic Indian cuisine and equally warm staff as compared to other places in little India.
Overview,Super food and the menu is quite spread over. You will have a lot to choose from. Location is in Little India and bang opposite to Mustafa departmental store.
Copper Chimney - Singapore,"After a long day at Sentosa islands we were craving for some good Indian in food And happened to visit it copper chimney. The restaurant is located centerally near the famous Mustafa market. Food was not only delicious, but,had excellent flavour and was very authentic.
Quantity of one portion is good enough For two people.
As we were really really hungry I could not be take pictures of food but yes the presentation was good and it was very delicious.

Food Ordered:-
Dal Makhani
Butter chicken
Chicken Tikka Biryani
Assorted rotis

The Chinese food here too tastes it very good and is not to be missed as we had food have constitutively 3 days and our stay was of 4 days

Overall a place worth visiting especially you are travelliwith kids and family and looking out for quality food."
Managers conduct resolving the conflict was bad,"Very disappointed with the cold shoulder given by the manager of this restaurant Mr.Inder pratap Singh

Me n my friend were there for light snack,everything was ok suddenly one lady hit me on my leg with the baby chair sitting beside table,it was rough bang but I just ignored n kept the chair little away so that it doesnt hit me again...
In a while her elder son aged around 14/15 years old again hit the baby chair in order to go out of his table and hit my toes again badly ,,this time I told him n the mother to be careful abt it as it was done twice within a span of 15 mins time.....
Guess what that boy just walked away as if he no sense of manners taught to him and the mother looked at me and said it’s ok ....as if I hit the chair n she is forgiving me
I said to be kind enough to say sorry on what u have done...to my surprise that lady asked me to shut up and called me “stupid lady”....
I m amazed that she has a gut to say n behave so rudely upon her own mistake
Sometimes people really don’t even show basic curtesy and manners
It was so very annoying that I had to raise my voice to get atleast an apology on such rude behavior ..and I called the manager “Mr.INDER “ who is so called manager there but a total waste..
He came n said I cannot do anything in this matter
Oh common u r the manager in this restaurant ,one guest is totally unreasonably behaving bad with another customer n u can’t do anything?????
Then I told this manager that I ll cal police now n settle this then so called the husband of this lady and another lady from the family came in the pic n started apologizing to me
It’s so disappointing that in this restaurant called Copper chimney and the manager called Mr.Inder is so very irresponsible to take charge of his duties
It’s really shows how inhuman a person can be...

Eventually the family members apologize n went away but the manager didn’t even bother to show any courtesy
Hats off Mr.Inder
I hope this post people see n get the impression of what can be happen to them too in future
Next time it can be food too right...???"
Simple but good 😊,"Friendly staff, incl. explantion. Waited 10-15 min for the Food as informed also by the waiter. Meal was not high-end but portion and quality was good and met expectations."
Good quality Indian Chinese and other food,Tried the Chinese menu excellent quality not very greasy or spicy 🌶 . Well prepared and in quick time . Good restaurant in terms of quality - quantity and price go for it
