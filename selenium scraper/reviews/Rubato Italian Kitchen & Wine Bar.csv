"Has become too expensive, bad service and empty place","For years we had dinner at this place and food was good, service was very attentive and price was reasonable. Always packed with people, very vibrant.
just this Saturday we had dinner again and they doubled the prices, service was no where to be seen and all tables outside were empty. Not going back again."
"If u ever catch yourself saying ""I cant find good steak in Singapore"" WELL SEARCH NO MORE MY FRIENDS","Growing up in Perth WA for 15years of my life I have had my fair share of steak eating and now being back in singapore for 5 years,
my search has finally come to an end!
My mum and I have never thought we would try our 1st Wagu steak in our very own hometown! soo soft and buttery yes it is how you would imagine!! The quality is most definitely worth your buck! We also ordered the carbonara and squid ink pasta, it is to die for, being used to eating American style Italian, Rubato is a whole game changer, nothing beats authenticity when it comes to food! Then we had the best Tiramisu we have had in a while, so soft and infused with so much flavour from the coffee, not overly sweet either so it was a really great way to finsish after a heavy meal as recomended by Sherwin and Raj!

And ofcourse if you are lucky enough to have the manager Sherwin on duty during your visit, best belive you will be taken care of, as well as bartender Raj, Sahil, Uncle and Wani being so hospitable, the kindest and warmest staff you will ever find!

I can say that over all It was a fantastic 1st fine dining experience, so worth the journy from Woodlands! 1000% reccomend! Mum and I are so happy we decided on Rubato Greenwood to have my early 25th bday dinner!"
Gem hidden in Bukit Timah!,Cosy dining and excellent food! Great staff and well taken care of throughout the dining! We felt really special and appreciated the attention given by the staff of this restaurant. Food was delicious and will visit again!
Seems to have lost the plot!!,"Visiting family in Singapore and use this restaurant for its great Italion food and
a short car ride away from where they live. We haven't been since the pandemic, but were looking forward to a revisit. The menu was now a blend of Italian, burger bar and some fusion thrown into the mix. When we arrived we asked to see the menu and given an ipad to scroll through. We decided to stay and were seated and left with the ipad for us both to choose from the menu. Not even an ipad each, plus you cannot study a menu whilst scrolling through the blessed thing. I choose lasagne which looked ok on the screen and my husband choose a chicken caeser salad. The salad arrived first and had streaky bacon as well as chicken, and crunchy lettuce. There was little else that you'd find in a caesar salad. My lasagne was a little late coming to the table. It was piping hot with a bunch of rocket and chuncks of beef on top. The lasagne was a mess of melted cheese and bit's of pasta, not layered and some tomato sauce underneath it. There was no bolognese ragu in the layers, just a claggy mess. When the waiter did a check back I said it wasn't what I was expecting and he brought me caprese salad instead, which I hoped would be pretty straight forward and it was, phew!"
Not your average Italian kitchen,"Visited Rubato couple of times before, but I’m surprised that they now offer Omakase. Tried it during my last visit with family, and it is beyond what I expected. Every dish is tasty, presentation is also good. Daniel, Sherwin, Yusof and Raj - the FOH, are all very welcoming and nice. They explained the components of each dish served to us and recommended what goes well with what.

This is another reason to love Rubato. Not only they offer the best dishes, but also excellent service. Will definitely come back again soon :)"
Rubato,"I love going to Rubato , the food is fantastic and most importantly the staffs are amazing especially Saahil and Daniel. They are always so accommodating to all our requests. More than the food I think I go back there because the staffs are always so nice and fun to be around. Thank you Saahil and Daniel for always making us feel so welcomed"
Impromptu dinner out,"Drove to Greenwood, random picked any restaurant that has available seating. Tried Rubato sometime ago (years). Giving it a try again. Ordered via app. Asked for recommendations and Burrata was on the list. Ordered to try but be warned cos it cost much more than the usual Burrata. It was quite large in size, tasted creamy and fresh. Nice but I probably will not pay for it again. The rest of the food do not have any wow factor. Especially when we tasted seafood that are not fresh, rather frozen fresh. Another disappointment, no bread basket served. You have to order their garlic bread. So it’s definitely a no no for me to visit this place again."
Amazing service. Even better food.,"From sitting down to settling the bill, the staff and food was amazing down to every little detail.

The burrata was fresh, tasty and they don’t cheap out on the accompanying salad and Parma ham. Highly recommend the angel hair pasta for something refreshing. But the most surprising dish was the tradition homemade Gnocchi (cream sauce). Very unassuming, but packs incredible flavour with just the right amount of chewy-ness.

I didn’t tell them it was my partner’s birthday, but the manager noticed we were in a celebratory mood and came over to ask what was the occasion. He insisted on giving us a tiramisu cake (on the house) and the staff put on, what can only be described as the most enthusiastic birthday song a restaurant done for us. I’ve been to Etna, Valentino’s, Lavo and countless other Italian restaurants in Singapore, but Rubato’s service and food is really in it’s own league. Can’t wait to come again."
Great food in a charming setting,"The food was top notch and all the service staff were very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. I love the area too, a quiet landed enclave that feels like a little village. We had a very lovely evening.

A word of warning if you're driving -- parking can be a challenge, but there is a valet service a short distance away."
So so only,"I went for an anniversary celebration with my husband and 2 young kids. We ordered the following and honestly were not impressed:
- A gift from the angels
Presentation was great but wasn’t too impressed with the taste. Scallops are not sweet. Uni was fine. Truffle taste wasn’t really exquisite. Will gradually grow sick of it.
- charcoal grilled premium cut wagyu beef
Totally cannot tell it’s wagyu esp given the price point. My husband’s verdict is that jack’s place taste better.
- carbonara pasta
Average
- garlic bread
Average
- tiramisu
For an Italian restaurant, I cannot believe the standard. I can see coffee dripping from the tiramisu. I don’t know why the chef will put strawberries on tiramisu and furthermore strawberries that turned dark, dry and totally yucky. It’s 2 pieces for $18 but I won’t buy it even if it’s 2 for $1.
- panna cotta
Average
Overall, I will not recommend it to anyone. I do see the pizza at other tables looking good though whilst another table complaining soggy fries. Big no no for the price."
Overpriced and not anything special,"The food was really overpriced for the quality - chewy and under seasoned. We got the pork belly (dry and not enough sauce), beef tenderloin (underseasoned and tough) and squid (tasteless). We were also shocked that the vegetables were brocolli, cauliflower and carrots. For a total bill of $400, I think there are other better restaurants with better service, ambience and food quality. It was also our wedding anniversary and nothing complimentary or celebratory was given."
Dinner amongst 2 friends,We started our dinner at 730pm and stayed all the way till 1115 pm. Sahil is such a great attentive guy from recommending us the dishes to the wine and checking on us all the time. Food is marvellous and service is great! Will definitely come more frequently!
Nice dinner,"Went for a dinner and really enjoyed the experience.
Nice place, nice vibe, good service and the food we tried was also nice.
For start we had a Burrata that is delicious and well served.
For mains my wife go a Pancetta Gnocchi and I got the Prawns Gnocchi. Both were delicious and well served as well.
Price is bit high but we will be back to try more options of the menu for sure."
Best pizza I’ve had in a very long time!,"Excellent pizzas made with very fresh ingredients. Referred this place to all our friends! Friendly, fast service, with attention to detail by the owner himself. Solid five stars. Jeanie."
Excellent,I came to Rubato for lunch and had a wonderful meal. The food quality was excellent and Sam looked after me and my dogs. Great restaurant where you and your fur babies can feel comfortable and good atmosphere and really good food. I recommend it
No value for money,Disappointing for an italian restaurant. Quality not as good as before. Quantities are small and courses are over priced. Not a good value for money!
Looks good but it doesn't taste good,"Not sure the servers want to be working here on a hot day. I ordered clams on pasta and a bubble tea here. MY BAD! Don't order bubble tea from an italian restaurant! Go to a proper bubble tea place. I felt the food was a little too salty. In the photos, it looks like there are a lot of clams and little pasta.... there really was not much pasta and the plate was huge. The portion was a little small for me. I think It would have gotten more points had it not been the hard boba in the bubble tea. And QR code ordering system was not working which added to my frustration."
Good quality of food and portion,The food is very tasty. The portion of the pork ribs is too huge for 2 pax so we pack it home for supper. Still tastes very well when it’s cold.
Everything average,"The decor and atmosphere was the only thing going for it. We felt that the waitress didn't seem that interested whether we were there or not, maybe it was still early and during the week, and we were the first guests here at 12:30. I just felt the service was average, not terrible and not particularly pleasant either. The prices here are somewhat expensive for what you are getting. I ordered a porkchop and it looked great, but it was really way too salty for my liking, everything was over-salted. The menu felt extensive, perhaps because we used the scan code and had to look at all the items on my phone, it felt like forever, having to scroll through the menu.
And when we selected what we wanted, it didn't go through, saying the system was down! Needless to say... didn't score great!"
Beware not Vegetarian Friendly!,I feel terrible giving this restaurant 1 star because actually many of their meals are lovely. My problem is that on two separate occasions I have ordered the Vegetarian Burger (online) and it has arrived with a beautifully cooked Impossible patty ... and bacon!!! I don't know why. They never answered my question. I have to write this review to warn other vegetarians that this restaurant is absolutely not serious about their vegetarian dishes. I would guess that the Impossible patties are being cooked in animal fat too.
At risk of going down the pan?,"Used to go to Rubato regularly several years ago. After a few years away, it was good to return and see some favourite items still on the menu....but not so good to see that the same flaws remain. Service can be a bit ropey, depending on time of visit; the staff rest area is in full view of customers (more unfair for staff than patrons) and the toilets continue to be abysmal. Given the price point & the overhyped claims on their website, details like these seriously undermine this restaurant's aspirations."
"Long waiting time, Waiter not masked","Bad experience at this overpriced place. Waited 45 minutes for a pizza when the place was not full . Despite 4 waiters claiming it will come soon, it never arrived.

Big concern on hygiene given that the waiter was not wearing his mask, or under his chin. Talking while serving food. Yucks ."
Awesome food excellent service,"Really good experience that was made possible by Sheila. What a joy to be having my Valentine’s Day meal with my other half, with not only good food but excellent service. Shelia made all this all possible even with my last minute booking. We will be back for more in the near future definitely, Thanks shelia for the tiramisu cake on the house."
Favs Restaurant!!,"Attentive staff , excellent food , great ambiance for a night out with the boys . Quite pricey but definitely worth it . Hats off to them all !"
The Ang Moh Boat Quay,"My wife and I have enjoyed coming to Rubato for a few years now. The food is distinctly average but it has a great atmosphere for a Bukit Timah restaurant.

Despite hearing rumours we have recommended the place to friends in the past - one group complained that they had been surprised by an unusually high bill at the end of the night linked to the wrong price quoted on wine. We put this down to a genuine mistake.

But on our last visit we were exploited in exactly the same way. After selecting a bottle, other wines were recommended as better alternatives but the price (double) was not mentioned. After two bottles we found ourselves presented with a bill that could have bought the tasting menu and a bottle of wine at Les Amis!

When combined with a dish that had to be sent back because it had rotten ingredients, a manager with his mask around his chin, charge for iced water and the other downsides of this restaurants it reminded me of the old days on Boat Quay in the early 2010s - go if you want the atmosphere but be prepared to watch for scams and choose your dishes wisely!"
Waiter was completely unprofessional,Service was dismal. Standard of food has dropped considerably from my past visits. Most upsetting was the unprofessional manner in which the waiter handled the bill. Because of him I will never want to visit Rubato again.
Birthday Dinner at Rubato,Great venue and food for a birthday meal. Weather was a bit miserable but did not detract from the well presented and tasty food that we had ordered. Staff were very attentive and friendly which always makes for a lovely evening out.
Average Italian Food,"When you cut open a good Burrata Cheese, is velvety soft oozing creamy cheese. That's not what we had here. Is hard and tasteless. They also save on fresh juicy tomatoes and seems to decorate with canned tomatoes.

Apart from the disappointing Burrata, Grill Squid and Chicken all Diavola were good. Tuna Tagliolini at SGD 68 was again not up to par. Tuna is hard and doesn't taste fresh.

They do not serve tap or warm water, you're force to purchase Acqua Panna 750ml on the table which is not too bad at SGD 3.90 per bottle.

We had a nice bottle of Chilean Chardonnay. Initially the outdoor tables seem like a nice idea but when it hits after 1pm, we were hot and bothered despite the big shade cover. Indoor tables only good ones are the ones near the window (probably just 2 or 3), rest tables doesn't look desirable.

Toilet ~ 6.5 out of 10. Total damage SGD 335.35. We'll stick to Oso and No Menu for now."
As close as what you can get in Italy,Not your usual italian food in shopping malls. Taste authentically italian with fresh ingredients. My friend and I love it.
They don't seem to care!,"We ordered their ""KFC"" at about 11pm on sat 25th. Ordered 3 boxes totalling about $110. Previously they made a mistake in not packing the chilli so we deliberately called them after payment to make sure they included the chilli. The delivery turned up, chicken was slightly burned in part and 3 packs of bottled chilli you might get literally in KFC. Called them, spoke to a gentleman called John who informed me they had run out, offered a free replacement (which I declined). Perhaps he should have notified us as he knew the issue. So he thought some awful store bought chilli was ok. I told him I needed a comment from management. He told me after getting my email that he would do that. 14 days later... nothing. Seems they don't really care about the quality of their food and to even make an attempt at fixing a problem. So zero points for QC and service. It's a pity as I think the food is pretty decent. But it seems that they don't care about me as a customer. So I won't care about them being a business!"
The Best !!,"Went last night for the first time after the lockdown , came walk in and decided to try their Chicken Diavola and Angel hair Pasta . This by far are the best ! Food quality is on top , service by the crews is amazing ! Friendly service warm welcome . Top notch !"
Completely average pub food plus fake marketing,"This place has typical pub food quality at 3x the price, and it seems obvious to me they have faked their way into having a high trip advisor rating (seriously, look how the reviews read). The oysters were completely dry, the servers had no clue where their oysters came from (red flag) or what mignonette was. Their $40+ lamb chops were tasteless with sides of two carrot chunks and two potato wedges that were probably heated frozen food. Probably the only reason this place gets away with their prices is because the decor looks fun on the outside and the clientele has never tried Italian food. One of the worst value restaurants in Singapore easily."
Amazing food and service,"Pizza and pasta was amazing, and the service was just as stunning. All the waiters and waitresses were helpful and lovely and I will definitely come back again."
Gift from the Angels,"The food is just fabulous! The capellini with scallops and uni is really a gift from angels. Also loved the tagliolini with truffles and the prawn fettuccine. The burgers were very good and flavoursome. We enjoyed the moist tender tomahawk steak. Portions are generous.
Leave space for the delicious desserts - tiramisu and chocolate larva cake."
Family & Friends Gathering,"Last Sunday (21/03/2021), we went to Rubato Italian restaurant as Sheila Garnell recommend us. As we reach to that place you instantly feel the good ambiance of Rubato, you feel the good welcoming as that time was actually raining but one of the staff shaded us with the umbrella which we felt very touching.

The food we had there was really satisfying specially the lamb, sea food soup, the organic mushroom soup, the fresh oysters and rest. We can highly recommend to everyone to go Rubato to celebrate whatever occasion you might have in the future.

Lastly we want to thanks again to Sheila, the staff whose serving us by name Herman and the rest of whole staffs of Rubato."
Edible but not worth the money,"Went there on a friday evening, place was quite busy hopes were up. Ordered 2 pastas, 1 pizza and 1 main. Carbonara and bolognese pasta were extremely mediocre. Edible but not really enjoyed same quality and taste could be found at pastamania. Neopolitan Pizza was alright, nothing special. The main was the “black footed boar”, a piece of barbecued pork. When the dish arrived, I sliced it open and to my horror, it was extremely raw. I immediately alerted the staff and they sent it back to the kitchen. When the piece of meat arrived the second time, the chef had simply cut the undercooked piece into slices and cooked it well done. They could not even be bothered to give me a new piece of meat. Had to alert the staff again and after 2 times they finally gave me a cooked piece of presentable meat. Even though it was overcooked, I could not be bothered to send it back again.

Place charges $4 per bottle of water they serve you. Chefs with no mask on or mask that didnt even cover their faces. Extremely unsanitary during this pandemic season. I was supremely disturbed by this and took a few pictures."
100,Food was delicious and very pleasant staffs! Celebrate a family member’s birthday there and it was a great experience!
Lovely post-CB indulgence,Ordered pizza and starters to share. Pizza base was crusty; salad with halloumi had a balanced taste and texture. Wait staff were attentive
"Torn, around 3.5-4.5, v inconsistent","Pizza is great, so is the chicken. Black pasta is good on occasion.

Lasagne (Christmas tray) is overpriced at $80 for one small tray... When we ordered the half portion for $40 another time it was way more than half of what we got for Christmas...

Inside is quite noisy as well, much prefer the times when we sat outdoors.

Overall, inconsistent. Great some days and for some dishes, poorer on other days."
A restaurant worth visiting again,"The food was great (especially the ribs) and the service provided excellent. A special mention for Hazel who assisted us with our order. Great service , thank you very much Hazel."
Nice Italian Cuisine,"Visited this restaurant this evening. Nice well spaced out seating - inside and outdoors available. Chose indoors with air conditioning. Pizza for dinner which was excellent but far too big for one. Nice tiramisu for dessert.

Great service and good food. Would certainly return if in the area."
GOOD FOOD AMAZING SERVICE,"Our 3rd time at RUBATO. we chose this place to celebrate our new years eve family dinner. from the start we are told that its better to take the set so that we can try all the best dishes that they have on the menu, and yes my family and is was so happy that they really served amazing good food and the service was tip top. we are all very looking forward to come back and invite our friends to dine in at RUBATO. well done."
Poor start but great finish,"We went as a family group on New Years Eve

Initially we were very disappointed: there was no table despite our booking and we were just asked to wait - no explanation or anything offered while we waited.

Finally, 35 mins behind schedule, a table emerged. And we were then pleasantly surprised by the quality and speed of delivery of the food, and very impressed by the genuine apologies of the staff who couldn’t have delivered better service.

Their team won us over after a very shaky start; we’ll definitely return and would happily recommend others to try it on a less frantic day."
Amazing food,"Ordered their mushroom pizza and it was delicious with rich tomato base topped by a thick layer of mozzarella cheese and juicy mushroom that was especially impressive. Another main dish ordered was the carbonara. Could taste the bacon which adds an extraordinary flavour to the rich and creamy spaghetti. For dessert, we had both tiramisu and chocolate lava cake (actually would prefer lava cake over tiramisu). Ended the night with both a scoop of hazelnut and pistachio gelato, which was definitely a fantastic choice to end the meal. The overall ambience was great for a date or friends gathering (I really liked their song list)."
Review on rubato,"Really suitable to have scrumptious meal with frens here. Would totally reorder the Angel Hair cold pasta and their pizza which comes in great portion. Lastly, the service provided here is really great and heartwarming. Totally recommended!!"
Very disappointing Christmas Eve dinner,"Terrible service, underwhelming food.

I made reservations for a party of 4 for Christmas Eve dinner. When we first arrived, we were waiting at the counter without anyone attending to us for a few minutes with staff just ignoring us as they walked pass us. I understand that it is a busy night as it is christmas eve, however that was not a great start to the evening. Another reason why I mentioned that was when someone finally attended to us, she brought us to our table and sternly warned us in a tone of a discipline master that we only have till 8.30pm at the table (reservations were made for 7pm) and told us that we have less than an hour and a half to finish our meal. I could not help myself but told the service staff who attended to us that had she attended to us punctually at 7pm when we arrived then we would have the full hour and a half that was entitled to us when we first made the reservation.

As we sat down, we were told to scan the QR code on the table to view the menu. We were told before the dinner that due to an influx of bookings for the christmas period, a 200 dollar down payment would be required in order to secure a reservation at the restaurant and that we would not have any choice but to order their christmas set menu as well. Despite all this, no one actually went through the menu with us explaining the dishes of the limited choices that we already had (which we later learnt that other tables were allowed to order off the ala carte menu), in fact, it was so challenging to get a service staff to even take our order.

In any case, we only had a choice between fish, lamp and other option that I have now forgotten, for our main course without any other options for the other courses. I ordered the lamp while the rest ordered fish. Thankfully it didn't take too long for our dishes to arrive, however, for some reason or another our dishes arrived in the wrong order. When our main course arrived, the others were served the fish first while I had to wait another 10 minutes before my lamp was served. I had ordered the lamp medium rare. However, when my lamb arrived, not only was it bleu and raw on the inside with the lamb still bleating, but it also had a non existent sear on the outside which suggested that it was barely even cooked at all. Naturally, I had it sent back for it to be cooked to the temperature requested. When my dish came back, thankfully the lamb was now seared and was at the desired temperature. However, the vegetables that came along with the lamb that served as the garnishes were vastly undercooked and still hard. The only saving grace of the dish was the mashed potato that were somewhat of a decent standard. Service staff who served and attended to us during the meal were also undertrained and did not observe the proper service etiquettes. No questions were asked about our dinner either.

When we paid for the bill and left the restaurant, they did not even take into account for the 200 dollar deposit we had initially placed and charged us for the full bill. We did not realise and remember till we had left the restaurant and was on the way back. Thankfully, when I called the restaurant back, they transferred our deposit back promptly.

Overall, a very disappointing experience for christmas eve. I would not recommend patrons to this establishment. There are way better restaurants for authentic italian cuisine at the same price range as Rubato in Singapore. It does not help that parking is also a nightmare.

Definitely do not recommend."
1Hr15Mins Dining Duration,"We were made known by Hazel that my appointment of 4 pax could only dine in from 630-745 PM as the table was booked for next customer at 745PM. What ?! The short dining duration~75 mins was not what we expected. What’s more is that while we rushed to finish our meal within that unreasonable timeframe, our last dish, salmon pasta served only at 730PM -:( What kind of service was that. Though the food quality was satisfactory, the service has indeed rooms for improvement!"
Distasteful food at improper prices,"First of all, we had high expectations coming to the restaurant (being french and all with good reviews), my wife and I were sorely disappointed to discover that the food served was poorly prepared. We placed an order for a quattro pizza and a black linguine seafood pasta.

The pizza served was absolutely horrendous. The crust was tough and impossible to chew through and the cheese was absent on half the pizza.
We paid 24 dollars for a used carpet.

The seafood pasta served used spaghetti instead and at this point we decided not to take it up with the waiter / chef. They could plainly see that 1) we were not enjoying the food and 2) the food served was Not Palatable and did not bother to check up on us.
We paid 30 dollars for spaghetti.

Do not visit!
Unless you're finepaying $7 for table water"
Top choice!,"Made a reservation after hearing good reviews about Rubato. My experience turned out to be stellar, attentive service, cosy ambience and the food was amazing. They customized a splendid platter according to my preference and everything was on point. Beef, lobster, squid and scallops were all done to perfection. Thumbs up and wonderful experience overall"
POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.,"Made a reservation for 5 pax at 7:00pm, waited 50 minutes and no table was available for us. A female staff made us sit at a small table outdoor and told us to wait till there’s a table inside, with NO safe distancing measures enforced. The tables were super close to each other and we were seated back to back with other customers. Even when customers left & there were empty tables inside, they gave the tables to people who came later than us & treated us like we were non-existent. We were not updated about the table availability. What’s the point of making a reservation then? When we checked with them if theres a table available already, they kept saying 5mins, 10mins, but to no avail even after 50 minutes. I’m never coming back again, the customer service is horrible. In conclusion, it’s a terrible place."
Poor poor poor,Very disappointing....from “we do not offer ice water” till the quality of the food and value for money....we will not be coming back - especially with so many other good choices at Hillcrest. Poor poor poor....Rubato you can and should do much better !!!
Don’t even bother,We booked a table at 6.45pm. We were told upon arrival that we had to give back the table (that we booked online!) before 7.45pm. Few minutes later we were denied to get ice water as they only serve Evia as still water. We left and did not even have a chance to try. Maybe good bu custumer experience is cleary a huge issue there. Don’t bother there a thousands of wonderful restaurants in Singapore.
It is what it is.,"I booked Rubato to celebrate my friend’s birthday, but it turned out to be a very disappointing dinner on Friday night!!! :( (Return us our Friday night!)

Meals tasted ok, nothing out of this world (price point is not worth it) but then out of the 5 items that we ordered, the mushroom soup and salami pizza served was very salty.

After we are done with our appetiser and main course, we asked a few of the waiters (since different waiters came to serve us to sell their “promotion” items which is damn ex) to clear our table for 4 or more times. I was already feeling uncomfortable because it was getting humid at where I was seated in the corner. After 30 minutes thereabout, table was only half cleared despite clear instructions asking them to clear all then serve the dessert tiramisu that I specially reserved for my friend. At this point of time I was damn pissed alr but I still kept my cool because I really wanted a peaceful evening.

So being all frustrated and feeling stuffy, I asked for the bill then suddenly their service super fast. 1-2 mins later the waiter who billed us and served us finally realised that we still have a tiramisu unserved. Despite him asking me to have the tiramisu multiple times, I told them that we do not want to have the tiramisu anymore cause I was already perspiring and feeling uncomfortable.

Within five minutes or so,they still served us the long awaited tiramisu and at this point of time our table is still half cleared. (Still have the glasses and unfinished mushroom soup, tsk!) Cause we were waiting to be billed. I really damn pekcek but still talk to them in a nice tone that we don’t want the tiramisu anymore and insisted to just settle the bill and leave.

All in all, it’ll be my first and last visit.
I hate the service there since we got the preferential treatment just cause we did not go ahead with their “recommendations”."
Aglio Olio good!,I had the aglio olio prawn. Excellent food and excellent service! Love it would come back again for sure!
Highly recommend,"Food: Beautifully cooked authentic Italian food. Seafood item are very fresh and great! Love their signature pizza too. And they served my husband’s favourite Evian water at half the price!!! (compared to other Italian restaurant that we went)

Price are on the high side for food item but you pay for the quality.

Service was warm and impeccable. The staffs are welcoming and attentive with our request.

Ambience: good vibe and perfect for weekend! Suitable for date night. My husband love the vibe there, will definitely come again! Highly recommend!"
Mushroom risotto was disappointing,Have u seen a mushroom risotto that looks like this before? Dish presented wasn’t the same as the menu. Mushroom taste was lacking. Was looking forward to the dish but was disappointed.
Average fairly expensive (faux?) Italian.,"It is always a bad start these days when a restaurant charges for bottled water. When it is (allegedly),an Italian restaurant and they only offer one brand of water flown in from France it is a piss-take in my view.

The food is not bad but not inexpensive and for the money I’d say average at best. The kitchen is semi-open and frankly the hygiene didn’t look great."
Highly Recommended!!,"The food here are so tasty! Coupled with an impeccable service and great ambience, will definitely come back to visit again with my friends and family!

A big shout out to Mushroom and John for being so thoughtful and providing us with an excellent service! It was our father's birthday and he thoroughly enjoyed all the food (and a surprise birthday song) the staff prepared for him! Thank you for the lovely dinner and making his day!

Highly recommend all to come down and try their food! We tried their truffle pasta, lobster pasta, seafood risotto, tiramisu, gelato and lava cake. They were all so yummy!!"
Disappointed,"Having eaten in Rubato’s for years, we understand the service has never been great, however, they reached a all time Low on Saturday. The restaurant was overly packed, a lack of social distancing and just too many people squeezed in together. Will strike this one off the list, sadly."
Great Experience!,I was invited by my dear friend to join her for a dinner at Rubato. It was my first time and definitely not the last time. The location is quite far from where I am staying at but it was worth a restaurant to experience. The ambiance is definitely class and the food is amazing. Our experience wouldn't be completed without the excellent service of Mushroom and Prabu. Mushroom check on us constantly to make sure our food is good and our overall stay wonderful. Also compliments to John from the bar for our ordered drinks and making sure it satisfy us. I will definitely come back and recommend this place to my friends and clients. Again wonderful stay.
Good Italian food and ambience,Dinner was great with good service. The e-menu was not very user-friendly but the staff did his best to share on the few recommended dishes.
"Service is slow, food is average","Service is slow, the staffs are friendly. Food is average but compare to the price. Ordered Parma ham, sautéed prawns, mushroom soup, lamb rack and angel pasta with scallops."
Just the best take away ever,"We usually love this place to dine in, but tonight the take away meal we had was quite exceptional. A half dozen exquisite oysters and a sublime Oso buco for myself. Kids and hubby more than pleased with their orders too. Don’t think I’ve had a better take away meal. Ever."
Excellent dinner by rubato as usual,"Rubato’s the go-to restaurant for my partner and I whether it’s for a quick supper fix or when it’s date night. We visit about twice a month and during this circuit breaker, we typically order once every week. Food is usually very good, although they could work more on the consistency of the quality of their food. Special commendation to Eazt Wong who is detailed and conscientious in serving his customers. He remembers our favourite orders, provides good and honest recommendations, never fails to greet us with a genuine smile on his face and makes us feel very welcomed there. Dining at rubato for 1.5 years and counting has allowed my partner and I to create many good memories together and we have Rubato, Eazt and his team and the good food to thank for that!"
Expensive but good. Extremely,"Expensive but good. Extremely unreliable when ordering on line, it will take you 2 hours to get your food. Not worth it, pity !"
Best Service Ever!,"Me and my husband went here and John, the one who served us, was so nice and welcoming. He offered cocktails and drinks that will complement the food we ordered. Thank you to John for the great service!"
#Foodgoals,"Since the Virus is all over the City my wife doesn't want to go out and eat, until a friend recommended a neighborhood restaurants which is not crowded and offer good food. its our first time at RUBATO, the place is really good and the music is very relaxing. we have the Ossobuco and Seafood bag,which was really good and fresh, the drinks is absolutely refreshing, aside from excellent food they also have a tiptop service. special mention to Mr.Mushroom, the desserts he recommend was awesome, we will definitely comeback and invite friends."
Impeccable service and scrumptious food from wonderful staff.,The chilled angelhair pasta with Hokkaido scallops in truffle oil has always been my family's favourite. We had that and a pizza to share on top of our own main. We ended our dinner on a sweet note with a birthday cake decorated by the staff. We enjoyed ourselves so much at Rubato!
Excellent food and service,Family celebrated my wife's birthday dinner at Rubato. Food was absolutely excellent and well presented. The service was tip top. The staff even decorated by adding fruits to a cake we had bought and brought along to the restaurant.
Best Burrata Ever,"We had a marvellous meal here last week.
The Burrata was simply exquisite and the Wild Mushroom Soup was also a delicious treat, as it tasted like no other we had tried before. Next up was the Chicken Alla Diavola. The meat was tender and the skin, perfectly done with a nice slight crunch. It was paired perfectly with the ""devil's sauce"".
Tiramisu brought an end to our beautiful lunch. It was moist and had the right balance of favours, quite possibly the best one I had tasted in a long while.

Besides the food, I enjoyed the choice of music played and the relaxed vibe.
Service was also top-notch and free parking was readily available.

Definitely looking forward to my next meal there!"
Great Food & Service!!,"Rubato is quickly becoming one of our favourite restaurants. The food is good, our favourite is the rubato’s pizza as well as the squid ink risotto. On top of that, their service is excellent. Their waiters are always friendly and helpful. Shout out to Mushroom and Eazt who have made every dinning experience a great one. We will be back soon!"
The scallop pasta really good,"Its my first time to taste the combinations of Parma ham, prawns, mussels & scallops in pasta..truely authentic dish..its was really really delicious, also the profiteroles was so good..will come back one more time to taste it again the other dishes..thanks chef Berlin & John..👍👍👍"
A must try when in SG & Great Dining Experience,"It's our 2nd time to visit Singapore, apart from the local food to try. We decided to read more places to eat via tripadvisor, which made us choose Rubato because of the good reviews. The place looks like a classic Italian restaurant that you can see when strolling around the city of Milan which gives a good vibe considering that we are in Asia.

And just like what we always do, we asked the restaurant’s member what is the best dish to try for 1st timers. The member named Mushroom suggested the squid ink risotto and rack of lamb for our meal. True enough I have no regrets ordering the risotto, it is cooked well and tastes really good. I don’t usually eat lamb but this one is a must try. But aside from the superb food, we are amazed by the hospitality and friendliness of the members especially Mushroom. His name is kinda catchy and easy to remember so if you ever visit Rubato, I hope you also encounter him. Over all, I will definitely be back and invite more friends to visit the place, and will try desserts next time."
One of the BEST!,Our first time at RUBATO. And I would definitely say that Rubato didn't fail to amaze us. Food is extremely nice and presentation ia even more powerful. My biyfriend and I enjoyed our dinner thanks to John who recommended to us some good drinks that makes our dinner more memorable. Job well done Rubato!
A place I will always come back to 💕🤩,"One of our favorite Italian restaurants in Singapore. The “Gift from an Angel” appetizer is to die for, and we always come back for their pasta mains! Our favorites include the aglio olio and the squid ink pasta ☺️ But honestly, the best thing about this place is the super friendly and thoughtful staff! Always happy to recommend us the best dishes of the season, best wine pairings and best desserts to finish off our meal (while also being unafraid to crack a joke or two with the customers) 10/10 will recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing dinner/date with amazing pastas and nice,cozy ambience too!"
Very accommodating staff and good food. Must try!,The food was great and really really nice. The service was excellent. Everything is worth the price. We will surely come back again and moreover we will recommend it to our friends and family. Good job team RUBATO.

Dinner at RUBATO,"Linguine seafood bag is just simply awesome.Pasta is cooked perfectly al-dante.Served by very friendly waiter, Mushroom. Thank you for the awesome dining experience. Will definitely recommend to my friends, and will definitely come back again."
Superb service!,"It was my birthday and my family and I went to Rubato for dinner. During our dinner, my kids saw that another table had a birthday cake and the restaurant's staff sang the birthday song. They were really excited and thinking that it was the practice in this restaurant, they ran to let the staff know that it was my birthday too! They said they would like the same platter of cake. It was only when my husband went to check on what was happening that he realised my kids had unknowingly ordered a dessert costing $49! He cancelled the order. The staff decided to provide us with a complementary molten lava chocolate cake. It came with sparklers and 3 staff sang to us. It was so awesome! As my daughter said, ""This is the best day ever."" Thank you, Mushroom and Prabu, for the fantastic service that goes the extra mile! I will definitely come back again!"
Excellent food and service,Really awesome food and service here. Our server Mushroom was especially attentive and made our experience extra fun. This is a great place to have a special event at. Will definitely come again!
Fabulous food and service,"We had an everything seafood lunch. The seafood soup and seafood pizza were so generously topped with mussels, squids and prawns. I had a grilled eggplant salad which reminded me of an Italian vacation. Lovely!"
"January 29, 2020 Extremely","January 29, 2020

Extremely Delicious Food and Amazing Service

One of the staff name Sherwin recommend to us “The Cold Angel Hair Pasta” and the Tomahawk beef. the cold pasta was extremely good and the tomahawk that we order is very juicy and tender. Appreciation to chef Berlin and all the kitchen team. All the staff is very entertaining and friendly. We will definitely come back. Very impressive team RUBATO."
Great pasta,"Great Linguine Parma Ham Pasta, Our family loves it. Till the next visit, we are going to try other dishes as well but I prefer pasta."
A truly delightful evening at Rubato again!,A truly delightful evening at Rubato again. We enjoyed ourselves very much - the ambience was terrific; the staff were really friendly and efficient; and what can I say about the food - a fabulous gastronomic feast that would give many Italian restaurants in Singapore a run for their money. Owner Marcus Wu runs an awesome facility and he manages a wonderful restaurant. Kudos to a legal eagle turned Master Chef. Thanks again!
Great service!,Was celebrating my bf’s birthday at rubato and i must say eazt(the manager) service is excellent! Very funny and helpful guy who go extra mile for the customer! Will definitely go back again! Food was excellent as well
Yummy!,"Another amazing meal at Rubato! Never fails to disappoint. Great atmosphere, great staff and fantastic food!"
Food was decent but overpriced.,"I had made reservation and had communicated with the server. However, I was not told their regular menu was unavailable, and the menu they had was the Christmas menu (it was NYE). Fortunately, food was decent even thou overpriced. Other than the initial lack of communication, service was acceptable."
Rubato always impress!,"Great food, friendly staff. Our choice for celebration. Highly recommend the fresh oysters, “Gift from the Angels” and the squid ink pasta."
"Great and friendly staff, delicious food","Went there for a birthday celebration, staff were welcoming and more than happy to entertain. Sang birthday songs, had a beautiful dessert set up and even had cocktails on the house! Food was marvelous too."
Beware of the hidden charges!,"Beware of the hidden charges from an unpriced menu, bottled water and truffle additions. Otherwise the food was okay!"
Saw that this place was highly,"Saw that this place was highly raved thus made our way there for a NYE dinner.

On arrival, we were showed to our table. We were waiting for other guests, the waiter opened a bottle of water and poured into our glasses. We didn’t realize that the bottle of water is chargeable and he did not inform us either. He didn’t even ask if we wanted water?!

We were then presented the festive set and a curated ala carte menu. On googling, we realised that the “curated” ala carte menu had the same items as the regular ala carte menu but cost at least $10 more for each item.

Overall the food was really good. But really unhappy over how the restaurant go out to “cheat” their guests."
Great Experience,"Pet friendly place. Had the vongole which was excellent as usual! Service was good, very friendly. Ambience was perfect"
Scrumptious weekend dinner,"Read a lot of good reviews about this restaurant, 1st visit and it didn’t disappoint. Had the lobster cappuccino soup, cold angel hair pasta with scallop.

Forn the main, we was recommended their hand stretched pizza, spaghetti bolognese, squid ink pasta and Black Angus tomahawk it was good in portion, perfect doneness.

Only had one dessert (chocolate fondant cake) by the time we finished our starter, soup and main we were too full.

Wait staff were attentive, fast in service and good product knowledge. Good conversationist and was friendly. Asked for honest feedback and took our comments well. Will definitely make another visit.

Keep up the good work and the delivery of food quality. Thanks for making us full, we had a very enjoyable night."
What an experience !!!,"From the moment we walked through the door until we left the staff were extremely welcoming,friendly, helpful and courteous.We were welcomed warmly on arrival and the excellent service continued throughout the meal. We chose the Festive Set Menu which recommended by our waiter. My wife and I deliberately chose different dishes from the set so we could share and every dish was lovely although the stand out dishes for were the classic terrine foie gras with real truffle shave, cold angel hair pasta, and main course herb crusted lamb rack is something to die for. dessert was excellent. We ordered the wine to suggested by the waiter and were impressed with the choices. A very memorable dining experince"
Pleasant Italian Experience,"I must say the Lamb Ribs, (on mains) is just way awesome. My guests from Japan are amazed and satisfied.Besides their daily specials and The unforgettable Gift from the angel cold pasta (simply amazing it was)

My 1st visit together with my guests because of a special request on Lamb. No regret.
They have the spicy salami pizza, was good, Still preferred pepperoni though.

The ambience, environment, staff attentive and service was just awesome
They are quite hidden from the city, Google them to get the directions."
Satisfying Italy in Singapore,"Coming to Rubato reminds me of homely Italian- warm, boisterous, flamboyant. People are eager to make contact and attentive. Of coz, if you happen to be on a busy night/weekend, be prepared to be more patient ( it happens everywhere!) trust me, you have not travelled enough if you are complaining.
I love eating at Rubato because I Know I am getting what I pay - Food that will satisfy my tummy!!
I absolutely love the Burrata Cheese with Parma Ham, what a heaven compared to other restaurants. (Don’t be put off by prices first)
It’s creamy and large serving (absolutely value for $$). I love it on my favourite blue plate. The mushroom soup was delightful, exceeded my expectations. Eating here is acceptable when you compared to the quality you get. I just had a ramen in New York for $45 sin, fast food burger $25 sin, a pizza for $50 sin. The world is getting expensive, not Rubato. Comparing international standards, I know eating at Rubato is satisfying at the price I am paying. “It’s A Great atmosphere to chill with friends/family. Honestly, I can’t even find such quality in real Italy."
Wonderful dinner,"If i can give 10 to my rating i will give them 10stars. Such a memorable experience. It was my fathers birthday and we all decided to go and visit Rubato for the first time which according to my lady boss that been there is serving great food and have a excellent service,

Im a so happy because the moment we enter the restaurant we are all welcomed by the staff and assist us to our table. The place is really good. Even the chefs inside the kitchen smile and greated us. We ordered thier famous cold angel hair and it was really really awesome. Our mains is some pasta and meats, the spaghetti Squid Ink is amazing the taste is well balance and the serving is generous as well, while we are having our mains i also noticed the table beside our table is having cold angle hair and they are very happy about it as well.

Our table is well take cared from the start to finish even though the restaurant that time is almost full house, i would say that if you want a good place + better food + great service, visit Rubato. I love this place so much. We will definitely comeback and invite friends at Rubato,"
"Poor service, disappointing food, dirty and expensive","Very poor service. The waiter brings me my salad but no cutlery. He now comes back with my cutlery. I mention that my friend sitting across from me will also need some cutlery-but we are still waiting for her salad. We are still waiting for the water and our wine.

The “classic” Caesar salad is anything but classic with 4-5 large strips of bacon, different dressing and no anchovies. The main entree of ravioli 3 (maybe 4) ravioli looked like they had a fight in the water during their preparation. Minimal filling and torn apart. A lot of mushroom sauce but on a very flat plate. Difficult to “spoon” up. Tiramisu base tasted like it was soaked in a tasteless wet water base.

Restrooms were very dirty. Dusty old eucalyptus leaves hanging over the sink, wall. The wall mounted flush panel covered with dirty water stains. Doors very dirty. Neighboring store room door open- messy interior visible for all. Same door has paper taped to the door requesting staff keep the door closed.

Very disappointed. Still hungry after a tab of $190.00. Will not be back."
