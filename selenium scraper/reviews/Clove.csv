Clove,Clean environment..very polite service by the staff..and the food was amazing..definitely will visit again.
Family dinner,"Very good chocolate themed buffet and the service staff were very polite and helpful, especially Anand. We will definitely visit again in the near future."
Nice food and nice place,The foods are nice and fresh. I would like to extend my gratitude to Sarah who assisted and very accommodating to our request. Thank you Sarah for your hospitality. We would definitely come back here.
"Overall, not bad at all!","I went for the Clove Buffet twice last year and once last night. It was very crowded the two times last year, and I was mostly forgotten by the service staff. However, it was less crowded yesterday, and the service was very good. Thanks go to Selvan, Amshyar and Ha Phuong. Hope I got the spellings right.

However, to me, the most important thing about a buffet, is of course the food. It was quite a good selection and I could only try about 50% of what was on offer. Most of what I tried was reasonable to good. I particularly liked the drunken prawns, the strip-loin roast, the beef rendang, the cold prawns, cold crab, kueh pie tee, the Yu Sheng salad, beef stew, fried rice, the little cakes, ice cream. The fish maw soup was also particularly delicious.

I didn’t like the crayfish dish. They are often badly done at buffets everywhere. I also found the dhal curry not to my taste. They also had a yellowish veggie that I didn’t like. The usual Broccoli would have been a better choice. The smoked salmon pieces all stuck to each other. Not sure why. I only ate a slice or two as I was a bit wary. Tasted ok.

I didn’t eat the breads, minestrone soup, various salads, cold meats, cheeses, sashimi, sushi, Laksa, oysters, some sort of large fish, cold scallops, some cooked dishes etc as I just didn’t have room for them.

They gave us a little piece of cake with a lighted candle as it was my friend’s birthday. You have to make a request. But it’s Definitely a nice touch.

I prefer this buffet to the chocolate themed one. I find cooked dishes using chocolate a little strange, perhaps pretentious even, especially when the chocolate does little for the dish. . Anyway, I’m going for this buffet again next week to try the dishes I missed yesterday. I hope the service remains good."
Elegant Buffet,"Service was very good, greeted at the door, the managers and staff Shah were very friendly and have a great customer oriented disposition. The buffet is very well laid out, with crispy roasted pork thats bigger than an exercise jotter book, very crispy. Smoked and sashimi salmon, yu sheng and great salads. They have fridges along the buffet line, that keeps food cold. Very good, open layout seating. Very spacious and comfortable"
Find another option within foodie Singapore,"Singapore loves its food, but Clove has no passion for flavour or freshness. Freshness was a problem with the bread, salmon, sushi & seafood in general. Failed flavour hit with the Laksa, & majority of the hot meats. Overall, poor food, impacted more by the equally rude & unhelpful management who could organise proper seating for our large group."
Friday Chocolate-themed buffet dinner,Large variety international buffet (including seafood). Chocolate-themed food options were eye opening :D
🎄🎄🎄,thanks Shah for the awesome service! nice restaurant with yummy food. my friends and I had a great time🤗🤗🤗🎄🎄🎄
Pleasant experience with good food and great service!,"Food selection at the buffet was good. There were fresh oysters which was definitely a plus. The beef carving station was good too.

Service from Selvan and team was great! They patiently listened to our requests and delivered professionally. Also, they surprised us with a small cake as it was someone's birthday at our table. That was very thoughtful of them! Thnx again, Selvan and team!"
Brunch,"I was looking for a brunch place for o celebrate my wife’s birthday. Clove is a very open and bright place, the spread is extremely generous.

Shah was amazing, we were well taken care off. Out of nowhere he even offered to take our pictures.

Great service, amazing food spread!! Must visit."
Shah was great,Visited Clove for my birthday and the food was amazing. Shah also provided great service and was friendly.

Singapore Break,"A great place to eat, lots of choices and very tasty.
Staff were lovely and friendly, greeted warmly by Elaine and shown to a table each time
Shah was great showing us to the table.
All of the staff are happy and friendly.
Definitely would recommend"
Pre Christmas 🎄 lunch buffet with my bffs,"My first dining at Clove and we love the beautiful ambience
Awesome gathering with my ex colleagues.
Thanks to Jason and his team(Elaine, Selvan and Chian(limping leg waitress) was so nice to reserve the seats for us and thanks Elaine for making extra effort to serve pastry w Christmas choc tag on cake. One of the staff offer to have our group photo taken. This impress us and we enjoy every bits of weekday buffet lunch.
We will be back again.
Great customer service ;)"
Delicious food and awesome service,"Visited Clove and had a wonderful time. Food was great, lots of variety and service was outstanding. Special thanks to Shah for his attentive service."
Birthday celebration at Clove,The food was delicious and the service was excellent. Staff Shah was a delight. He took a lovely pic of my family - all 9 of us. Thank you to the team at Clove.
A pleasant experience with excellent service,"It was my son’s birthday and we didn’t manage to book our table online, so we went on to be put on the waiting list. So we decided to walk in and tried our luck.

To our surprise, Selvan and the manager managed to prepare a table for us knowing that it was our son’s birthday, also prepared a birthday cake for him to celebrate.

Service by all the staff was excellent, the plates were cleared in a very timely interval. Food was really good as well! Definitely a highly recommended place and we would be back again!"
Wonderful service and great spread,"This is not quite the typical buffet spread cos there are chocolate in focaccia, cheese, salad, cauliflower cheese gratin! Great for chocolate lovers but may not be quite the same for others. Value for money!"
Lovely buffet,Lovely fresh oyster.. very fresh seafood! The briyani is delicious too! Beef Striploin tender. Tom Yam and Laksa is a tad salty. But good flavour. Selvan’s very attentive… we are so pleased with his lovely little surprise of a b’day cake!
Great Food and Wonderful Service,Absolutely delighted with the wide selection of dishes. Everything taste great. The staff are attentive and very friendly. Will definitely visit Again! Highly recommended!
Excellence in Service by Sagi & Shah,"A Birthday Celebration that was saved by Sagi & Shah! They found us a table for 9 pax amidst the Super Peak Friday dinner session! Due to a blunder in reservations on my end!

Excellent customer service indeed by Sagi & Shah!
Thank you & Appreciate the help!

The Chocolate Themed Buffet dinner was very Unique & my kids Loved the dessert station & the adults enjoyed the fresh seafood!

We had a great dinner experience!
Will be back again!"
Fantastic buffet,Good food. Fairly priced. Wonderful dessert. Magnum ice cream. Food layout is a bit on the tight side but overall it was great to be there.
"Large spread, interesting choices.","The selection has a very large variety, and does different cuisines very well. From fresh seafood to different salads and various hot dishes, the quality of food is very high. They are also very interesting choices of dessert such as their nitrogen cocoa, which was surprising and delightful."
Birthday Celebration @ Clove,"Wonderful birthday celebration @ Clove, food selection was ok however the customer service was the best! We were served by Shah and we absolutely enjoyed his hospitality and cheerfulness! Kudos to the rest of service team as well!"
Good variety but lack quality,"We had a blast here pre-covid as a large family but was disappointed during this visit. There was a very long queue when we arrived. Despite reservations for 8, we were ushered to a table of 4 and a table of 2 - so on the spot they had to improvise to combine the tables and put 2 chairs at each end. Thus, we ended up too close to the couple beside us. Felt a bit apologetic for almost ruining their romantic date.

Food was hit and miss. Briyani was good. Lamb was also good but server was tired and unfriendly. Much of the food were not warm enough e.g. soup, dishes etc. Or too dry e.g. pasta. Sushi was sad - very small with dry rice (my partner commented that he can get better sushi at a local supermart).

Shelves for dessert were so high up that I could not even see what was on the last shelf - had to do my best to tiptoe (still cannot see) and had to just randomly grab. Probably need to be at least above 160cm to comfortably take from the shelf.

But that being said, there was quite a variety of food. If you enjoy the experience of a buffet with friends or family it is a nice place to go, but not if you are a foodie looking for good food."
Crowded Breakfast Place,We had breakfast at this restaurant and there were so many people that it was difficult to move around. The food is regular fare at 5-star hotels. I did not find anything special about it except for the interiors which was really beautiful. Perhaps if I had gone when there were not so many people then I would have more to appreciate.
Great food selection & value for money buffet,"Visited for a family birthday celebration. There’s a very good promotion for Accor members so definitely very value for money.

Service is great and Sam went out of his way to prep a small complimentary slice of cake for the birthday lady. One minor thing to note that there is minor service fee for bringing in outside food - so for those who are thinking of bringing in your own cakes, please do take note.

Food selection was great! With a wide variety of fresh seafood, japanese sushi, Chinese, Indian, Nonya and live stations. It will be better if the food were all kept piping hot.

Will be back again!"
Dinner @ Cloves,"Just like to say a big thank you to Mr Sagi and Mr Shah for effort in getting a table for us despite no reservation and full house on Sat nite. They called up diners and managed to get a table for us when one of the diners couldn’t come.
Thank you so much for your kind hospitality and friendliness and willing to run the extra mind.

Once again, thank you!"
Great variety of options for breakfast,"This is the breakfast venue for guests staying at Swissôtel The Stamford. The variety is huge, but menu changes are subtle daily. There is always a long queue during breakfast runs, but the queue moves very quickly. The staffs are efficient in clearing the empty plates on the table."
Nice buffet,"Very nice and delicious buffet. Excelent service, especially from Shah. 50% discount for guests staying at the Swissotel."
Excellent service and ambience,"I would like to convey my sincere compliments to the team of Clove , espcially Amshyar, for the wonderful and awesome customer service. Food was excellent and the entire service team and chefs made it even better with their dedication and hard work. Thank you for making our evening such a lovely one. Keep up the great work!
Best regards,
Olivia and Choon Chye Koh"
Birthday celebration at Clove,The ambiance is casual. Good for families & gatherings. Decided to celebrate my birthday at clove with my family of 5. Enjoyed the 50% discount average $40+ Per pax after less. Selvan was attentive & took care of us the whole night. Almost full on a weekday. Reservation highly recommended.
Excellent service,"Very happy and glad to celebrate my friend’s wedding at Clove. Although we notified the team on the actual day but they could still whip up a surprise at the soonest they know. Kudos to the team! Had a pleasant great time there, food is good too ( I love their dessert options )"
Dinner,Good variety of food options. The ambiance was also great and very accessible. Great service from Shah and the rest of the team
Lunch at Clove,We celebrated our friend birthday at CLOVE. It was made extra special with the service crew especially mr Hilary Cheng.
6-Stars worthy service,"Our waiter (Amshyar) is observant and amazing. He noticed my pregnant wife was having backache and went out of the way to look for a cushion for her, even though we did not asked for it. A 6-stars worthy service from him that made our dining experience enjoyable.

Thanks Amshyar!! With your awesome attitude alone, you can go far."
Good Selection for Buffet,International selection was adequate and they had chocolate buffet on weekends. Would recommend friends to dine next time
Best service staffs,"Excellent service staffs rendered by Khan Amshyar, Sagilan , Nicole & Hilary they were extremely awesome.No words can describe how wonderful their service are. ❤️ My daughter had the best time ever. The staffs really made a big difference to our visit at Cocomelon. ESPECIALLY to Amshyar & Sagilan you guys rocks.
Cocomelon are very fortunate to have you as their service staffs. Thumbs up"
TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE,"I do not not know how to rate this TERRIBLE Experience with no options for anything worse than one star. . A kid friendly restaurant with a faulty sound system which continuosly blared out whatever sound that I don't even know how to describe. My 2year old was too terrified to stay to finish up the food & when we tried to pay & leave they made us wait another 15mins for the system to start up while the horrible blasting was happening throughout. Manager charged full price for the food even though we had to leave the full table of food untouched as the kid was too terrified to even stay another second. Talk about a kid friendly restaurant, it's even worse than Halloween."
Great service by Sha,"He was professional, efficient, and friendly. One of the best customer service. He knows the menu well, checks on how everything is doing, and is generally really helpful."
Nice ambience,Happy place for kids. Lots of pretty cocomelon characters and music. Friendly staffs especially JJSha!
BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION,"This place was a very enjoyable place to eat. recommended for little kids . My 10 year old daughter enjoyed this place greatly and the food was very good too .

Especially thank you to our attender -Amshar.
Great service, and very attentive food recommendation by him was done well too !"
The Cocomelon Street,"I went to this restaurant with my 2 year old and my parents. Was amazed to see the entire set-up. Every turn reminds you of cocomelon! My toddler was so excited (which was the main aim).

We ordered Bella Rainbow pizza which hd vegetable mousse toppings, was surprised at how a healthy take on a pizza can still look fancy. The dessert, Sky Cloud was the star of the table and was absolutely delicious, light and creamy but not too sweet.

The service was excellent. A good food should be a given in any restaurant, but if the service was unexpectedly good, you tend to remember it for a long time and for all the good reasons. I had to mention Marites who was lively and attentive just as how one should embody the cocomelon vibe.

Overall, my toddler (and us) enjoyed the cocomelon experience (maybe a bit too much, she didn't want to leave)."
Not Family nor Kids Friendly to dine Low quality of food for the price,"Celebrated my daughter’s 3rd Birthday. Great crew and theme but they really need to improve alot on the menu and taste of the food.

Had Salmon Bagel which smells fishy, husband finds his burger tasteless, my daughter’s salmon croquet served in a shape of a dog-bone (not so appealing as it makes her look like eating dog food and she refuses). The only thing we enjoyed is the dessert. At least something that we can appreciate.

Points that we hope could be a better dining experience in a Singaporean context:
a better menu for toddlers, finger food size for toddlers, serve your main customers - toddler’s easy grip drinking cup instead of the adults drinking cup, and to work on ALOT on the taste of the food that’s being served. The price and food served really doesn’t match.

Technology has indeed improved so much during this COVID period, I still can’t understand why marketing team could really drive parents mental by having to queue on weekends for a long period before getting a seat? It’s really NOT easy to keep excited toddlers in line during this covid period. What’s the issue with booking a table with time limit.

For me to come back; REALLY NO! It’s not family nor kids friendly, I would rather bring her to Swensen’s or PS Cafe which is one floor up for a better quality meal that she will sit and enjoy, and my husband who is the pay master - gets to enjoy his simple burger as well."
Treat for the kids! and Treat for the adults too!,"Cocomelon is a great reason for any kid/baby to smile, whilst the wheels on the bus rang in the background, the menu was impressive! We had ordered the fish/smiley chips for our kid, a Mediterranean platter, and a chicken/avocado sandwich. The food was great! The theme is well adapted and the play area which was very orderly managed is a treat for the kids (below 5). The service staff is totally commendable (i forgot the name of the Filipino and Sri-Lankan wait staff, but they were just warm and smiley!) Marcus Hanna was on-site and great to have met the MD with ""hands-on deck"" Keep it, consistent guys!"
Fairmont Staycation,"Have been here on 2 occassions ..... have had a Sinfully Swiss ( rare ); and Goaty met Beefy ( rare ) .... both on sourdough bun .... and I enjoyed my burger immensely. Am willing to forego my fries :)

My family members each had a Lobster Mobster, and it was bold, dry and chewy. Clove will need to work on this more to make it more appetising.

Had also ordered the onion rings and chicken wings. Would give the onion rings a miss cos felt like it was frozen and not appetising .... and I'd preferred buffalo wings instead of Korean style deep fried wings.

We ordered the Nutella and Earl Grey Thick Shakes and we enjoyed them very much. Decided to give the Salted Caramel a miss this cos too rich."
Cutting a burger takes a long time,"Having eaten burgers countless time across different countries, I’ve been stumped and surprised at CLOVE ...a burger vs burger cut in half will take significantly longer time to prepare (emphasis on significantly). Apparently the process to cut a burger at clove seems to warrant a whole different process vs other restaurants"
Dinner,"I booked for a birthday dinner and I noted it in my reservation. However, when we politely asked if they serve complimentary cake, they said should inform them during booking which I did (3wks ahead). So it was not served.
We ordered 6 different kinds of burger: double up, raging bull, oink-moo, le grand foie gras , when goaty met beefy and lobster monster. They all tasted the same, except lobster monster but the portion is small. Not worth for $28 ( i attached photo). Pls do not order the oinion rings too. My son said, burger king tastes better . Ladies night for 2 bottles of wine worth ~$90 is a lil pricey. The only good at this restaurant is the 30% discount when you are using OCBC, other than that, maybe look for other place serving burgers as their specialty. Anyway, thanks for the experience"
Epic festive buffet in the time of COVID,"Many thanks to team at Clove who looked after us when we went for festive buffet.

10 course buffet....the food was excellent but I am afraid was way too much for us! In hindsight I would have told the team to only bring certain courses. Shame we could not pack the remainder to take away.

Special thanks to Guna who spoke to chef regarding veg menu for my dad. Also special thanks to Chef Simon who whipped up a veg platter with delicious salad..my dad really enjoyed it!

Finally thanks to all the other servers who looked after us well. Definitely will consider coming back for standard menu!"
Calisa is the best !!!! Great,Calisa is the best !!!! Great evening with great food shame Andy covered me in crab juice on the starter!
10/10!,"Ambiance is great here at Clove. Their burgers and shakes really hit the spot. The service is also excellent. Our server, Yoges, took good care of us throughout our dining experience. Will definitely be back"
Calista was very friendly,Calista was very friendly and cheerful. Food was good. We will be back again. Good service. The ambience was relaxing.
Inventive burger combinations,Inventive burger combinations with attractive plating. Service is also attentive and personable. Been there twice already since they opened. I just wish their fried could be fatter and not the ones you can get from Macs.
Burger and Shakers!,"Re-opened with a new casual dining concept. Good selection of burgers, salads, plant based items, sides and shakes! Dessert looks good too!

Ordered Mr Gordon Blue, ham and cheese stuffed with chicken, cranberry jam on bun and green. It comes with thick cut fries too. Bun was soft and juicy chicken. Combinatiom with cheese was light, not overwhelmingly rich. Thick cut fries remains crispy almost throughout the meal.

Had the Skinny Fit salad too. It has wild rice, brown rice, blueberry, raspberry, blackberry, avocado, feta cheese, quail egg, cherry tomatoe and pumpkin seeds, toss in pesto sauce. The salad alone makes a good meal, ingredients used are fresh and generous in portion.

Indeed a meal packed with wholesome goodness. Next... To try the irresistible thick shakes, boozy shakes and dessert!"
good burgers,Fairly new restaurant in Swissotel Hotel. Had their lobster burger and Flying burger on Kale buns. Interesting presentation. Taste was good. Pricey for burgers. Very good service from Calista.
Good Service and Delicious Food,"Mr. Gordon Blue with Kale Sourdough Bun is really nice. The sides and shakers are delicious too. The staff always with a smile on their face, even though they are wearing mask. One of the staff, Calista who served us is friendly and patient."
Good burger & Good good,"Good food good service, especially to Calista whom was very attentive warm in here service. Cheers! Karyn"
Good food!!!!!!!!.......,Good food good environment! On top of all best service!!! The staff gave very good recommendations!.......
"Burger craving, SATISFIED! 💯","I've been craving burger for weeks and just about right my friend suggested to vist this place. Let me break it down just a bit ...

Food - EXCELLENT! The burger was juicy, tasty and comes in a big serving with fries on the side. They let you choose how you like the doneness of your patty should be served.

Drink - MIXED WELL! We ordered coffee milkshake and a beer, nothing too fancy. However, there's much on their menu you can pick out from.

Place - FANCY! I am a fan of good interiors and pretty places. I enjoy appreciating the beauty of the place as much as eating their good food. I believe that a good ambiance adds up on the feeling of satisfaction.

Team/Crew - ACCOMMODATING ❤ We went on a Sunday afternoon (late lunch), from the moment I enter they were all so nice and were very prompt on our requests. Thanks a lot Rudy, Guna, Yoges, Calista and Chan Chee! And to the one who arranged our reservation, Isabella, thank you for the cake (Oh btw, it was my advance bday celeb)

I would gladly recommend visiting this place not just for a good meal and a beautiful ambiance but most especially for the good staff to serve you ❤"
Excellent customer service and delicious food,The food was delicious and the price is reasonable. I would to give thanks to a service staff by the name of Anthony. He is very attentive and provide excellent customer service. He explained to us the ingredients of the food n good good recommendation. Two thumb up!
good place for burgers,"We used to come here for buffet. Now it is converted to a burger and shake restaurant, providing a great variety of choices."
Awesome dining experience,"We went down to the Clove at Swisshotel last week.

The place has introduced new concept - burgers / casual dining so it was surprisingly refreshing.

The burgers are creatively designed and professionally prepared.

To add on, the service is even more impeccable. We were particularly impressed by John who was very lively and attentive throughout the evening. His passion in service and friendliness truly made our dinning experience a memorable one.

Kudos to John and the team! certainly looking forward to revisiting the place soon.

Oscar Tai"
Great service and wonderful crews.,"Great service and wonderful service crew, especially Guna who went through the menu with us and made nice recommendations."
Awesome burgers and shakes,"Had dinner here at Clove. New concept that's for sure as it used to be a buffet restaurant. Now serving up Burgers and Shakes. Prices are generally not too scary.

Overall, quality of burgers are excellent. Very delicious. The nutella milkshake recommended by Anthony was superb. Down almost half of it within 2 minutes of it being served. Would like to thank Anthony, Isabella and the team for taking great care of us. Will definitely be back!"
Awesome restaurant!!,The food here was excellent. The service is great. We would definitely come back here for a meal again! Delicious!!
Great Dining Experience,"I want to comment Isabella Lim, she's has a great personality when she welcome us and find us a seat. She's attentive and always smiling. She never failed to serve other guest and make them feel welcomed. When ordering for drinks, she recommended Kale Almond Milkshake, indeed it was a smooth and chilled drink. I like the drink!! She's has done well in her job and Good Job for having her!!"
Chilling with Friend,"Isabella Lim is Attentive and well-mannered. She recommend me the cranberry, which was a good and cahilling drink for me. Which is turn out not bad^^. She remembered my name and said goodbye!"
Great occasion restaurant & top immaculate service,"Food taste marvelous, great service! Love the ambience.
The service by John & Yoges were super professional, flawless, excellent and pleasant, they were so welcoming us from the time we stepped in. Food that I personally like it very much are Clove Classic , Middle Eastern Medley & Double Up burger .
Highly recommended place to dine and relax, definitely come back again."
Burgers and Shakes,It was a wonderful night out at Clove. We were particularly impressed with Isabella and John! Cheers!
"Open, inviting environment and nice food","Went there for a weekday lunch with my young family. The burgers were superb. However there isn't much other choices. The dessert was fantastic as well. Tried their apple and clove crumble, it was unique and nice. There was this waitress by the name off Calista, who was extremely friendly with our kids and was entertaining them through out. Appreciated the friendliness and good service!"
Impressive!,"I recently saw Clove at Accor Plus member offer website, so without hesitation went for post-lunch dessert & drinks today.

We were greeted and served by Calista, a fantastic young lady, who went the extra miles to recommend the desserts and even showed us the photos of some desserts on display, and advised the sweetness degree. Such a gem, hope the management continue to develop her.

She also gave good recommendation of burgers which we decided to order as takeaway.

Love the ambience, decor and the creativity in the menu. Even the staff pink uniform gives a cheerful vibe.

I’ve already made our dinner reservation here for my upcoming staycation in Fairmont. Can’t wait to return and try out more items. Will definitely be back more often before this place gets discovered and packed!"
Disappointing buffet,"We were staying at the hotel and were quite excited to try the buffet at Clove for dinner one night. However it did not live up to expectations. It was very expensive and the majority of food was aimed at the asian palate. Any of the Western options were quickly taken and the wait for them to be topped up took forever. The thing that moved my review from terrible to poor was the dessert options, it was delicious and a big hit with the kids. Staff were practically invisible and it was often difficult to get their attention to get a drink top up."
Nice ambience and delightful poke,"Ate with department colleagues during Xmas. Ambience is nice and the poke bowl selection was delightful! Unfortunately, did not have much time to try out the other mains. Will do so on my next visit."
Excellent service,We had dinner at Clove n really appreciated the spread. Lovely service with Rudy and May Chu who were awesome and even gave us a rose for Valentine !
Great variety,"Went for CNY buffet gathering due to the DBS 1 for 1 promotion. The selection was good - seafood, sashimi, beef, yu sheng, indian, chinese roast pork, duck, etc. Serve staff was attentive - clearing plates and refilling food. Only minus point was there was strong sunlight during lunch hour which was made the restaurant slightly hot."
Pleasantly surprised by a choice CNY buffet spread,"Contrary to the impression one gets by this buffet restaurant that generously offers deals at every turn, I actually enjoyed a buffet dinner spread that tickled my fancy on many levels.

Being a cheese aficionado, I hovered their cheese offerings and came away countless times with some really lovely moulds. And their gravlax was simply sublime and fortunately for our table, repeatedly replenished as fast as it was cleared.

They had a cute little lo hei corner which I observed throughout the night to be the delight of every diner present, both young and old.

Ultimately, what took the cake (pun intended) was the dessert cabinet/corner. Not only did they churn out exquisite mignardises bursting with flavours and textures, every time I returned for a top up, they brought out new creations. What a delight and surprise it was as I came to this buffet with very lowly expectations. I'm truly ashamed to have done so but so ever thankful to their pastry chef at the Clove.

My only humble suggestion is for the Clove to seriously consider curating a menu for an afternoon tea. If what I savoured at the recent CNY buffet spread is anything to go by, I would be quite certain that it would be a runaway success. And I would be more than happy to be one of the first taste-testers...*wink*."
"Good food , Great Ambience","3rd visit to this restaurant since Sept'19.. Food spread was great, good quality food. Great ambience with clean place. Went for dinner during 1 for 1 deal ard SG 46 per pax aft tax. Staffs are attentive . Highly recommended.."
Mum's 70th Birthday Dinner,Great Service by Kristine ! Enjoyable Dining Experience Our family had a good experience here at Clove Restaurant
Great dining experience,"The food selection is great, the crew were very nice and accommodating, the place perfect. Well worth the price. Must try for the whole family."
Good place to catch up with friends,Great food and very good selection. Very friendly staff. A very good place to spend quality time with friends and family.
Very good experience,"Dined with my family the other day. Lovely buffet,friendly staff and we loved the create your own yu sheng."
Nice,"A spacious restaurant, Clove caters to the varied tastes of its customers by offering an array of delicious eats and prompt service."
"Very average buffet dinner, not worth the pricing","Went for a double celebration on 27th Dec with family. Ans while the staff were friendly, the food selections were disappointing and didn't seem very fresh or appetizing. Definitely not worth the $100+ per pax including teenagers. Unlikely to go back there again."
Not great,"Went for dinner on Boxing Day, 26th Dec. Some food items are ok, others were a letdown. The staff carving the turkey was very stingy, I asked for some turkey and he gave me a very thin slice. Then he immediately put his carving knife down. I looked at him in disbelief, he then saw me looking at him and asked, ‘you want more?’ And I said yes please, to which he sliced another thin sliver of turkey. It was unbelievable! My husband had to ask him 3 times and it was still very little. The mutton rendang was an embarrassment! Huge letdown. It was just sweet, can’t taste the spices which is supposed to be rich and tasty. It doesn’t look well for a hotel this established to get a popular and authentic Asian dish wrong. The rolled sushi with seaweed was dry and unimpressive. But the cooked Japanese prawn at the live station was good. And the waiting staff was good too, always around to clear tables and fill up our drinks. The food was so so, nothing great."
Dinner,The spread is limited. Turkey and Ham are so so. Limited choices at the sushi spread and the rice has no standard. The other counters are Indian cuisine. The laksa is very good. Not worth if not for 1 for 1 promotion.
Never again,Read my photo coz I really can’t be bothered to re-write it again. I’ve posted in my Instagram. Really it’s not worth your money
Good buffet restaurant,Was invited during their opening day and visited Clove several times being an accorplus member where I enjoy good dining benefits. Overall a lovely buffet restaurant vs old Cafe Swiss. Total facelift and the concept was good. Like the new ambience and staff service overall good. Some feedback given during the opening was taken note and I can see the improvement too. Restaurant has several tie up with major credit cards so it's a good deal.
My colleagues and I went for,My colleagues and I went for our Xmas dinner celebration. The design of the restaurant is so beautiful. The Japanese foods are the best. Staff are attentive and friendly. Wish they had Chilli Crab though.
Great Service by Ms May Zhou,"My friend and I came to Clove for dinner to celebrate her birthday. The service provided by Ms May Zhou was excellent. She was very attentive to our needs, very friendly and approachable. Great job Ms Zhou!"
Lunch,"It was a nice LUNCH expirience we had at CLOVE Restaurant .. foods are tasty and lots of variety ...Our special Thanks to the staffs like Mr.Guna, Mr.Yoges and Ms.May Zhou... they are very attentive to ask if everything Ok aldo the place was full
Keep up the good job.. we will definetly come again and see you soon."
Food is below average,"Not recommendable to come at all... this will be my first and last time ... not worth for the price ...

1) Poor selection of food (cooked food, dessert)
2) No replenishment of food ... I’ve to call them to top up
3) Slow clearing of used plates
4) Sashimi not fresh at all
5) Few diners in the restaurant

Simply don’t understand why some reviews gives a four and five star review !

Simply wasted my time n money ...

There are much more cheaper and better buffet out there..

I hope my post will be posted and not deleted as I don’t wish other diners to waste their money

Thank you very much"
Food is not tasty.,"Sashimi lacks variety as only salmon is offered. Freshness is lacking too and cutting of sashimi is unskillful and uneven. Overall, food is not fresh and not tasty. Staff also appear to be uninterested in serving customers."
Good food but poor service,"Food quality: 5 star hotel standard
Service: unbecoming of a 5 star hotel.
Environment: needs further improvement

Poor service from the get go. Was left at front counter for a few minutes before the staff attended to us. During the meal, plates were rarely cleared too.

Since the restaurant was somewhat inside the mall, the aircon and ventilation were rather poor. We were practically sweating inside the restaurant.

Furthermore, the buffet only served hot coffee and tea. There were no cold drinks or ice cubes other than iced water and sparking water. No soft drinks or juices whatsoever. Rather disappointing.

There was a decent spread of food,especially for the healthy, since there was a huge range of salads and poke bowl. Quality of food was also good although personally I would have preferred more variations of meat."
Good quality food but below-par service,"Had a very bad first impression as were kept waiting at the entrance for about 4-5 minutes. The worst part was that we were seen by at least 3 restaurant staff members but were not acknowledged at all or told to wait to be attended to. They just looked at us waiting at the entrance and carried on with their jobs, which was shocking. After that, we were finally attended to by the lacklustre manager (In a suit) and brought to our table.

The quality of the food was top-notch I’ll have to say, with a wide variety of food, especially the cheeses, desserts and delicatessen. Ice cream flavours were unique too with avocado and yoghurt ice cream being served.

However, the wait staff and one of the chefs looked like part-timers who’d just graduated from school and were ‘untrained’, so to speak. Food, like the cheeses and ice cream, was not topped up by the staff despite multiple reminders and despite them agreeing to do so. In the end, due to the delay in the topping up of food, I only managed to have 1 bowl of ice cream, which was very disappointing. Plates were also not cleared timely. The only positives were the quality of the food and the service of a middle-aged Male staff who was extremely polite.
Could do with much improvements with regards to the service of their other staff."
Exceptional service,"We had daily buffet breakfast provided as part of our accomodation package. There was my niece, nephew and myself. There was a huge variety of food and the menu was changing daily. My nephew absolutely loved the vanilla doughnuts. One of the staff, Venga, went out of his way to make sure my nephew was able to get some of these each day. We were regularly served by both Venga and Guna,both gentlemen, went out of their way to provide exceptional service. Guna knew we liked a hot chocolate and asked us daily if he could make us one.

The food and variety is great and the service was fantastic. The service provided by both Venga and Guna was excellent, personable and they go above and beyond.

I highly recommend this restaurant."
Good food but average service,"It was my first time having dinner over at this restaurant. Initially, we were quite impressed that there was a good variety of food. However, it was rather frustrating that we our plates were not cleared. We were rather disappointed as there weren't many customers at that point in time. We gave the benefit of the doubt that the hotel was understaffed. Eventually, I went forward to another waiter and asked if he could clear our plates for us.

Overall, the food was pretty good, and there was TWG tea served other than water. More could be done on the service."
Worth the $$,"Wide selection of food, seafood was fresh. However, not many types of drinks available. Good if you are a TWG tea or coffee lover because that's the only drinks available other than water"
Disappointing visit - good food but poor service,"I have been an Accor member for many years and it was my first time being asked to put down my credit card details to secure my booking (7 adults & 3 kids). I had to even scan over my cake voucher as well as my group dinning voucher. The booking also came with a 48 cancellation policy (if not charges will be made to my credit card). It was ridiculous and I felt almost offended. They explained that it was a large booking on a weekend and thus, they need some commitment that we would turn up or that they would be compensated if we failed to turn up. Probably they had their fair share of bad experiences but I felt I was being 'punished' for it.

However, decided to go ahead with the booking as we really wanted to try the buffet. I mean it must be really good if they are so fussy about it and it's also rather expensive comparatively.

After a few emails, they started addressing me from a 'Ms' to a 'Mr'. Then I recieved a cancellation notice which I did not authorise. They said they made a mistake and revert back my booking. Then I recieved another email to say that my booking has been amended to a different timing (which again I did not authorise). They revert back my booking a few hours later.

When we arrived, we waited for some time at the entrance. The queue was slowly piling up behind us (4 or 5 more families). It was strange to be kept waiting with no one at the counter on a Saturday night (they only had 1 person on duty and he took a very long time with the previous guest). Especially in a swissotel hotel.

Service was slow. Plates were piling up at one point in time. At another point, I was trying to walk past/through 3 service staff who were walking and talking together. It was really frustrating.

Some shelves were too tall for someone short like me (1.55m). I couldn't see the food in the serving bowls even when I tipped-toe (although I could see the signs).

Sushi counter was messy. They actually piled up the sushi??!!!! I have never seen that in any restaurant (even those at lower price ranges know how to present sushi properly).

Nevertheless, giving 2 stars for the good variety of food and great desserts. Honestly would have given more if this was a $68 (cheaper) buffet at an average hotel. Had expected more from swissotel and the price they charged.

Even with the group dining voucher, I would definitely give this restaurant a miss. The entire pre -booking experience was unpleasant and the dining experience was dampened by the lack of professional service expected from the swissotel branding."
Wonderful place to dine and to stay,"We are very frequent patron of this restaurant , and each time we are back it just feels like home as all the staff recognizes us and welcome us with a big hugssss! The food variety is good and taste yummy too, newly renovated space is also very well done and sophisticated ! definitely highly recommended !! Big shout out to John and his wonderful team ! :)"
