Food are appetizing, scrumptious and yummy.
Service was prompt and staff are patient to run through the menu."
Service can be improved. Beautiful ambience.,"The ambience exceeds my expectations.
Beautiful restaurant.
The food was impressive too.
Service staff bearings looks professional.
However some of the service staff seems slightly inexperienced & looking lethargic. They could’ve been more engaging when interacting genuinely with guests.
However, there was this particular service staff that really made us feel bothered.
I didn’t manage to catch her name but to describe it was a lady in hijab.
I am unsure if she was exhausted that evening but she really portrayed herself poorly.
We had our hors d'oeuvres and we were done and were left with only truffle fries.
Usually, service staff would have situational awareness and would know that we are ready for our main course or at least check on the guests if they are ready for the main course.
After much waiting we alerted one of the service staff.
After which came the lady in hijab serving us the mains with her body language that was signalling unhappiness and she said something along the lines “We waited for you to finish your starters then we going to serve the mains”.
She said it in the most unprofessional manner and almost seems like she was speaking under her breath. Her eyes + tone clearly showed that she was annoyed. To make it worse she didn’t even bothered to reciprocate when we thanked her.
I would love to compliment the rest of the team for making us feel welcomed. Constantly making sure our glass of water was filled and always smiling when called upon. It was such a shame I wish the lady had the same amount of positivity and energy.
I hope she improves and progress better.
Will return again to try the other menus."
Nice restaurant with good food.,Nice ambiance with a nice pool view. Restaurant is well decorated. Lots of local and western foods to choose from although is halah.
Good Value for Money Nice Food,"A wide variety of food - Asia, Mediterranean , Western and Fusion. The serving was big. We ordered the Wagyu Steak, Wagyu Portobello Burger, Burger Royale, Barramundi Fish Steak, Hummus, Beef Rendang Roti Jala, Skippy Sandwich Waffle, Apple Crumple and a pot of Earl Grey Tea and about $210. I feel that it was inexpensive. There are hit and miss in taste and generally well executed. Temasek Club members enjoy 10% discount.

The staff who served has her face mask below her nose. I had to remind her to wear it properly. I asked her for the brand of the tea and she replied as Artisanal Tea. I told Artisanal was not the brand of tea, then she further told the tea bag was triangular. She said all these without checking. However, when I went to the refrigerator to choose my choice of Gelato, she showed that the brand was Tea Forte. The male staff which I think was the manager and another female waitress was friendly and helpful. We were served water upon seated down and the cutleries were served promptly. The food was also served quickly.

The ambience was nice and they practiced safe distancing and checking of vaccinated status. Nice view of the swimming pool and surrounding greenery. Temasek Club is deep in and thus, it is not accessible to those without their own transport.

There are many plus points than minus points. I agree with the prevailing 4.2 rating on Google Map. I will return to dine other dishes."
"Raw prawns served, horrendous service recovery","Halfway into my meal I realised that the king prawn (see attached pic) was raw on the other side.

Proceeded to wave for a long time before someone attended to me.
The ‘Manager’ proceeded to send my food back to the kitchen and came back with a minuscule and pathetic portion served on a small dish, I rejected this very generous offer and sent back the dish without finishing my meal.

No apologies was given, the ‘manager’ even spilled our drinks on the chicken wings that we ordered as a bonus.

Not surprisingly, we were also charged for the raw prawns that was served. The ‘manager’ hesitantly removed it only after we raised our displeasure, again.

Abysmal customer service coupled with mediocre food.

Please patronise at your own risk!"
Unjust and Atrocious treament from Wait Staff,"My family and I were chased out from the restaurant as the ill mannered waitress insisted we were not allowed to dine as we had more than eight people from the “same household”- they claimed. We are aware of the regulations and we did not request for our tables to have more than eight people or to even be positioned closed to each other.

Our reservations were made under different names. As such, we made a separate reservation for a table for six and a table for four.

My husband and and I were seated at our table for four while waiting for the other two family members from a diffferent household to arrive. My parents were seated at the table for six while waiting for my sister and her husband to arrive with their two young kids and Helper.

We were attended to by two service personnels. Allow me to point out that, the blonde (bleached) lady named Tania and Malay lady in hijab were very hostile towards us at the counter prior to us entering. What a hospitable attitude!!

There were no warm welcome to the restaurant aside from “Do you have booking and under what name?” That lady had the tone of her voice raised at us.

My sister and her husband were told their table was located at the end of the restaurant near the window where my parents were seated/waiting for them.

As they were walking to their table, they had to walk pass my table. It is human nature for anyone to say hi when they recognise each other. My bro-in law patted my husband’s shoulder to acknowledge his presence while he pushed his son’s pram. Let me emphasise that there were no stopping or intermingling. It was merely a tap on his shoulder.

Tania might have been watching us like a hawk because the moment my bro-in law tapped on my husband’s shoulder, she immediately jumped in front of my bro-in law and held her palm in front of his face.

She said “You are not allowed to sit down as you know this group of people”. We were stunned because she created a huge scene in the middle of the restaurant!! It was embarrassing and humiliating to be confronted by the rudeness of an utterly disgusting service.

She held on to the baby’s pram to prevent my bro-in law from pushing their son, and raised her voice “You are not allowed  to go over to your table!”

We were shocked and asked why?

She mentioned that it is against the law to be in a restaurant with more than 8 people of the same household.

My sister explained to her that we are not from the same household. We offered to produce our identity cards as prove. She refused to listen to our explanation and continued to create a scene. At this point, everyone at the restaurant was watching us.

My husband stepped in to explain that we were not even seated together. Our tables were so far apart and we were not even intermingling.  Moreover, at which part of the law is stated that we are not allowed to smile or acknowledge people we know in a restaurant?

Tania shouted (yes she raised her voice again) asking for her manager to address us. Her manager was apologetic and explained to us that there was a change in the law. My husband accepted his explanation and asked if they could  provide it to us. His reply was: “Yes.  Please google it”.

It is unbecoming to throw the regulations and law reasoning at anyone without having anything on papers (or to dismiss others to just “Google it”).

We are reasonable people and, yes, we were not aware of the changes. Still, we deserved to be treated with respect. The restaurants’ service personnels could have pulled us aside to politely explain the situation. We would definitely have understood, and would have left the premises.

But instead, she embarrassed us.  All of us had to leave the restaurant. Their attitude and service standard left us feeling disgusted.  We will never return to patronise SPIZE again.

My husband and I went back to the restaurant later that evening to speak to the Manager. We apologised if we had not been adhereing to the regulations. We were embarrassed and expected a reasonable treatment. We made the reservations and with the change of regulations due to CNY, the restaurant could have contacted all their bookers and advised us of the changes. Nevertheless, Tania sat us at our table. She saw my husband and I came with our parents and we sat at 2 different tables. She could have enquired at the start prior to sitting us down at the table. It was very disrespectful and distasteful on her side to be attacking customers the way she did.

Otherwise, they could have addressed us with respect. The manager was apologetic and advised us of actions they will be taken on Tania and the lady in hijab. Apparently, there have been a lot of complaints on them. We needed a public apology from the two wait staff for the treatment we received. It was unjust!

Tania and her colleague in hijab should not be allowed to be in any customer service industry, given their unbecoming behaviours as waitresses in an established eatery. Their behaviours represent the image of SPIZE, and unfortunately, they have left us with a bitter aftertaste of ever returning to the restaurant.

While enforcement of any rules is admirable, it is not an excuse to not have any shred of manners or respect for patrons while at it.

It was an utter shame that SPIZE at Temasek Club has to be represented by likes of them, such poorly trained service personnels.

We will write to the Managing Director, Mr Anil Sabnani, for actions to be taken because we were disrespected. We were embarrassed and up to now, still feel dismayed by the treatment we received.

Service: Require intensive training"
Nice food good ambience,"Great place, great atmosphere and lovely food. Super friendly staff, knowledgeable and able to make great recommendations. Good food, mixture of some Italian, Mediteranean, English and Asian"
Amazing Breakfast,Nice food and good ambiance and nice Staff. The food is worth the money and affordable. Better to reserve before visiting as we encountered once problem as no space when we walked in.
A gem.,"A gem hidden at one of the Safra Clubs, along Rifle Range.
Service level up to standard: polite, prompt, professional and responsive. A mixed up with one of the orders was corrected immediately without question.
Food quality is great, fresh and tasty. Tried today the cod fish noodles with bon Choy and Lamb Briyani. I’m not a buff fan of Indian fare as I find usually too spicy but this Briyani with its tender meat was spiced to perfection. The cod fish noodles was very tasty; broth is spectacular.
You can’t leave without trying the ice cream waffle...."
Good view and ambience,"Cha kway teow is wet style but not bad, waffle good, hokkien mee not good. Try to sit at window to get nice view of pool and trees. It’s quite crowded so better reserve first. Haral foods."
Good service and good food,Ordered takeaway from the restaurant. I was sweating due to my 3.5 hrs long walk from Macritchie Reservoir to Temasek Club. The service staff took the initiative to give me some paper towels to wipe my sweat while waiting for the food. The food turns out to be very delicious and well presented! Good job!
"Affordable food, tranquil environment","3 of us came for weekday lunch, we had a really enjoyable lunch - nice greenery outside the windows, quiet place for catchup, portions are substantial without burning a whole in your wallet.
We had 4 iced drinks, 3 mains, 2 desserts, total bill $117. Couldn't finish our desserts. Will come back again. I liked the seafood horfun and the waffles."
"Severely lacking service quality, but good food and tranquil views","Would have given this place 4 stars for the good food and beautiful scenery, but the service (or lack thereof) my friend and I received when we dined here was disappointing.

Our female server tossed us the breakfast menu at 10.20am, saying we had a few minutes to order before the kitchen would stop taking orders for the morning (at 10.30am). We asked about the lunch menu, but she curtly informed us that it would only be served after 11am.

We managed to order one breakfast item, but one minute later (around 10.30am) when we wanted to order a second breakfast item, she said they wouldn’t take the order...so we ordered one item from the lunch menu and had to wait till 11.20am for it to be served. Kudos to the manager for helping check the status of our lunch order, because we had already waited for 50min by then and were getting very tired/hungry.

The food itself was of good quality, and the pool view was nice, although our server refused to let us have the window seats, which were largely unoccupied the whole time we were there."
Doesn't deserve even 1 star,"This place doesn't deserve even 1 star. I've eaten here 3 times and consistently the same experience.

Horrible and slow service:
1. Wait staff who cannot speak english. Order and talk to her in english, reply in mandarin and I'm not even chinese.
2. Extremly slow service. How many times do i need to ask when the food is ready?
3. Opens at 8am? I arrived at 810am and nothing was ready. Food stuff strown about the floor.
4. Black-faced staff. This is prevalent in pretty much all of them.

Such a horrible place to have any meal."
Beautiful green view from the restaurant,love the atmosphere as the view of the lap pool and the greenery puts one in the mood for the weekend.
Nice View But Food is So So ...,"Overall, a nice place for lunch because the of lovely view of the jungle and greenary. They have the usual coffee house mix of local and western dishes. We tried the mee goreng, nasi briyani, thai beef with rice and humus pumpkin salad. Presentation is decent and service if ok. But overall, nothing to be excited about."
Waffles were good but,"The appetisers - Saracha chicken wings sauce was nice in general, however I had a drumlet that was undercook and red and raw near the bone. The winglets were fine.
Had the wagyu burger, it was delicious so too the waffles with ice cream.
The staff overall was helpful."
Bad service,A friend brought me here for lunch. I like the coziness of the location but I have to say the service was quite bad. Like they cannot be bothered to serve customers. The food was OK That is all I can comment
Spize Rifle Range,"Nice food, nice ambiance.. great place for lunch and dinner with the whole family or your loved ones.. Kind of a regular customer here and always coming back for more..."
Good truffle fries!,"Went to the Temasek Club outlet. Had the fried chicken burger together with shared truffle fries. The truffle fries were really good, having both truffle oil and truffle mayo to give double the happiness! The burger, however, was average at its price point. The chicken was cut slightly too thin and so ended up being slightly drier than it should/could be."
Spize@Siglap - private and conducive,"We had a reunion at this restaurant, to celebrate the passing of another year. The menu selection was good, the ambience was very suitable, and the service was great. The food variety is also good. I enjoyed the burger very much (although my colleague commented that I could have had the same food item from McDonald's at a much lower price). The truffle fries and dessert options are good ones to have. Worth the price!"
Good family Restaurant with good vibe,"If you are at bukit timah area, drop by this affordable restaurant located at Temasek Club. Seemed to be run by Malay chefs, so you won’t go wrong with ordering Malay food and decent western menu. Forget about the chinese menu section."
Casual and relax restaurant,"My first visit to the restaurant. The food were quite nice and of good quality. Cost is above average, good varieties, service staffs were polite and helpful."
Generous Portions with exceptional lush landscape views,Good place for a leisurely meal. Dont forget to take in the fantastic Bali/Bandung like views. Portions of local and western fare are generous and food is generally tasty all round...Truffle fries and teh tarik go hand in hand here...
"Big portion, good for value/",Went to the Temasek Club outlet. The menu has a wide variety from Asian to Western cuisine. Food tastes great with good portion.
Large menu with good variety!,"Finding this restaurent was a delight! It has High ceilings, and very bright with full glass windows. The evening sun shines very brightly into their dining space until about 6.30 pm. Service could be challengingly slow and on weekends, and many food items could be sold out by dinner time. Not a place where we could bring our special guests. They have a very interesting varied menu, from steak to spicy Nasi Biryani. We ordered many dishes so we could have a good assessment of the quality of the cuisine. We had scallop fried rice with squid and prawns with belachan - very tasty, also oily. The Oyster blade was good. The lamb biryani was amazing!! Their chicken wings was red spicy, crabmeat mee tai bak was too soggy and spicy. Very family friendly, noisy and popular place."
Cheap Dining in the woods...,Kibda alfresco dining at temasek country club overlooking lust greeneries...relax n chilling...local fusion meditteranean...
Birthday with great food,"Came here for my birthday celebration this year. Food was really nice. Had an Australian Ribeye steak which was cooked really nicely and was very flavorful - the fries was good too. The other members of my family had a variety of food from the menu and were all pleased with their dishes. Being in Temasek club, the location is pretty inaccessible on foot and driving or cabbing would be necessary. As Spize is a popular restaurant, it would be good to book the place in advance especially if you are bringing a big group."
Good food and lovely setting,"Set in beautiful Temasek Club,this restaurant serves really good food. The presentation is impressive for all the dishes we ordered, and we ordered plenty. Prices are quite high as expected in this setting. Service though not bad, could be friendlier."
Pretty good place to chill,"I was there for a afternoon and I had a good long black, enjoying the nice environment and coffee. Despite raining outside, this place is quiet and cool. The price is not exactly very expensive as I expected in the country club, but its roughly the Starbucks type of expenditure. Tried the finger food, not great, but its ok."
Birthday celebration,The menu is slightly different from their usual spize menu..they have western/Mediterranean & Asian food which is perfect for a group..you can book in advance to avoid the Long queue during peak hours.. Reasonably priced for good quality..
Nice Restuarant,"Outlet was crowded and noisy on a Friday lunch. Ordered Nasi Goreng Ayam $9.50++, Bee Hoon Goreng $9.50++, Roast Chicken $19.90++, Earl Grey $5.80++, Kopi Terek $3.00++. Have to wait for a while for the food. Ice water is served. The Bee Hoon Goreng is good. Nasi Goreng was oily. The Roast Chicken is a little too sweet for me. Must make reservation on line. Would be good to eat the window view. Service was good despite being buzy. Portion size is good. Will visit again."
Meals,Lovely place for meals. View of lush greenery. Food is good. Service is pleasant. Prices reasonable considering the portion and location. Thumbs up!
Service was not up to expectation,"We were a group of 4 adults + 2 children. Ordered 2 mains, 1 kids meal and 1 spaghetti frizzante for 2. All were served except the spaghetti which took more than 30mins to come despite reminding or checking on our orders. The waiters just shoved us aside and said it was coming.. the rest finished their food and the outstanding order finally came. It was not very pleasant as it was our treat to our elderly parents who had to wait ao long for their food. We hope Spize can up their level of service in this. If order was missed, or would take very long, please advise. If there was an error, amendments or apologies could have been made."
Lunch visit on a Friday,"We did lunch on Friday here to celebrate our anniversary. The online booking failed as we arrived without a confirmed booking nevertheless they have a table for us. The restaurant is situated on the Temasek Club. Service is fast and prompt. We had the mussels and crab meat as starter which was good in the sambal chili gravy, the NZ ribeye was great and the fish Briyani was not bad. The coffee was decent and we were to full for dessert. Restaurant seem to take many reservation even on a Friday lunch so best to reserve ahead. Price wise is average."
Disappointed on the 2nd visit: Salty Food & Rude Service,"Today was my second visit to the Rifle Range outlet as I really liked the ambience on the first visit. This time, I am extremely disappointed by the service by one of the female middle-aged wait staff. Her rude attitude totally spoiled my birthday celebration. She spoke brusquely to my family and I, and when she missed out my order, rudely insisted that she had repeated the order when she had not done so. I was so speechless at such offensive behaviour. We did not deserve to be treated like that. I was appalled when I saw other reviews (TripAdvisor) by other customers who also experienced rude service by the wait staff. The food was also on the salty side. This is the going to be my last visit to Spize at Temasek Club."
very good Asian food,"Went there with friends for dinner. We had to queue about 10 min before getting a table. The menu is Asian, and western food. For Asian food you will find Indian, Malay, Indonesian, Thai, and Chinese food. The service was fast and the food was very good."
Great food at reasonable prices,Was there last Saturday for dinner with my family. We ordered both Asian and Western selections from the menu and were not disappointed. The portion for the Asian selections like Nasi Goreng Kampung was huge. I had The Royale burger which was made with a buttered brioche bun (yummy!) and served with fries topped with freshly grated parmesan. My daughter had the ribeye steak medium rare and it was cooked perfectly - nicely pink without being bloody. We also had waffles and gelato for desserts. Overall a very satisfying meal for the family.
Good food and place for family bonding,I like the food . Good portion and are tasty . It’s a place for family to go and enjoy . Environment is cozy and the price is reasonable.
Weekend Lunch,"Lazy Sunday late morning and we're looking for places that not too crowded with Asian & Western Veriaty food choices. My wife suggested Rifle Range Road. We drove there as this will be my first time and I didn't know what to expect.

We arrived at Temasek Club and headed to the restaurant without any reservations. We were lucky to get a table party for 3 as the time only shows 11:30am and its almost lunch hours. We were Served by mostly Caucasian waitress. I felt like I'm not in Singapore already.

I love the cosy interior and huge window overseeing the greeneries.
We ordered several foods as shown on the pictures. Will surely comeback on the weekend to have lunch here again with Friends.

I would recommend the burger and the desserts."
a Very Good meal,"~it's gonna be a long way driving in to the Temasek Club on Rifle Range Road but once there, just dropoff your passengers at the main entrance since Spize is right in front of it's doors

~this weekend we'd a late lunch but even at 2pm this place was packed, a ton of local folks came really far out to this restaurant to tuck in and it's Halal so it has a following :)

~service is very friendly and different wait staff were happy to serve... a difference unusual in crowded places, this one impressed

Lamb Briyani - YUMz simply YUMz
Fish Briyani - YUMz x2 the fish is a Barramundi such a treat!
Bangers & Mash - my son really likes this one and I can tell from the number of sausages it's super kid friendly
Linguini Al Funghi - WOW my son likes this too
Steak & Cheese Wrapz - my son likes this one :)

I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat, it's very very good!"
Third time GREAT!,"Brought my dad for a weekday dinner after two positive experiences with Spize(Rifle Range). Online reservation was smooth. A tip would be to indicate the preferred seats along with your reservation. Service at dinner was swift and prompt. For starters, we had hummus dips along side with the mussels + crab meat. Main courses we had Royale Burgers, lamb wrapz, fillet fish burger and morrocan chicken. The chicken was not impressive and lacked lustre, probably won't order this again. Drinks we had Grande Longan frosty and coffee latte. The frosty was absolutely great for a warm evening and a perfect way to complement our dinner."
Fabulous dinner,"Good food! Both Asian and Mediterranean choices are fantastic! Try the Hokkien Prawn Mee and the Sriracha & honey chicken burger!! If no reservation, can probably get a table either 5pm or 8pm during weekends. Therefore, reservation is highly recommended. Thumbs up!!"
Looks like they are not experienced in handling big group..,"We had a group of 24 for dinner. Since it's a big group, we sent out order to them in advance.
The person who was attending was friendly and enthusiastic but when the main dish came out, we were disappointed because most food were COLD.
When we sent out order in advance, we didn't expect them to cook and let it stand and turn cold.
They could prepare everything but shouldn't have cooked still last min when everyone is there and tell them that they can serve the food.
10 of us ordered Wagyu beef steak and they were cold. what a waste.
I like this restaurant for many reasons but I wouldn't come again with a big group.
When you come with your family (6-8), it's still fine. you get freshly cooked / hot food..."
1st time trying,"We had a office get-together here for the 1st time. As it is lunchtime, we need to wait a bit longer for out food to be served. service is good. will be back again"
Lunch on 8 Aug,"Food presentation was great, table was tidy and ready before arrival. Confirmation sms was sent 2 days, the day before and on the day itself."
"Good service, delicious food!","Good service, delicious food! Great for group gatherings but need to reserve early! Italian and Malay cuisine were good!"
Great lamb chops n chicken!,Enjoyed the lamb chops that I went back two days in a row... the grilled chicken was also very good. I like this place as it has a great view of the Bukit Timah forests and a relaxed environment!
Thumbs Up!,"I've been eating at the other Spize outlets down at River Valley and mostly, the one at Bedok. This outlet has got to be my favourite - simply 'cos of the ambience and setting. The food presentation as well as staff service was great. The price is abit on a high side as compared to the same dish you can get at their other outlets. But it's a good price to pay for just a nice meal out with your loved ones.

The only setback for me was how inconvenient it is to get there. You'll need a car."
Oh my God,"I have never like portobello mushroom and I never had any idea if it tasted that good in a burger until I ate one in this restaurant. The service was excellent, their staffs are very nice and always check whether your need is satisfyingly fullfilled. Will return for sure."
The burger is very nice,The burger is very nice. The servers are friendly and helpful when we cannot decide what to order... Happy that they have waffles!
Good food n ambience,The food was nice and reasonable. Booked 10.30am and food can only be served after 11am. Overall good. Worth the visit.
Good Service and Food,"We are a group of 7 people and we made a reservation on the morning for a quiet spot. And this was met. The food was great. However, the speed at which the food was serve may need to be reconsider. One of my colleague has finish her main course but the main courses for the rest of the 6 people has not yet arrive. Also, it is rather hard to call for the waitress/waiter to add orders."
Good food good service,Was at spize for a birthday celebration and apart from good mains the staff were very sporting with a rich salted caramel waffle with a candle and singing
Fantastic!,Love the brownie!!! Love the ice cream! Love the lamb briyani! Coffee is great! Service is fantastic!!! Absolutely love this place!!!
Temasek Club - Spize,Food is nice and the servers are polite. The ambiance is cosy and the pool view is magnificent. Food is also value for money.
Another great dining experience,SPIZE @ rifle range is becoming one of the family's fav dining spot with its wonderful ambience & great food. One minor peeve was music was too loud.
Good food and price,"The restaurant offers very good food at reasonable price. It's housed within Temasek Club at Bukit Timah. Twice when we went for lunch, it's almost full house, with many army officers. Therefore a bit noisy. We made reservation and had a table overlooking the swimming pool and greenery. The menu is extensive from Asian to western. The truffle fries is very good! Must try! Nasi Goreng Kampung is spicy and yummy. My friends like the Royale - beef burger comes with fries and a big portion. The Penang Char Kway Teow isn't the dry version but has some gravy and a tad sweet. Not quite my liking though. Servicing is good and fast."
awesome,all went smooth....great service even with change of timing...food came out not too late..food there was amazing..atmosphere is very calm n peaceful..
Spize at Rifle Range Road,Staff Gathering. Good service and good food. Staff responds promptly to any queries. Friendly service. Nice ambience l
Value for money,This place is very popular. Remember to make reservation. Food is very decent for the price. Very nice atmosphere.
Excellent service,Thumbs up to the Boss for the excellent food and service! Will certainly be back for other items on the menu!
Visit @ 25 Jun 17,Overall was great just that maybe the staff be more attentive for ordering food especially. Few incidents is we try to order food but they were busy with other stuffs or gesture saying will come back later or focus point maybe did not see us. Maybe can allocate more staff?
Good as always,The only bad thing I could think of would be the waitwe being to slow on taking order .can seem to get order in 10 mins sometimes
Wanderful dine out,The food is nice and the price is reasonable too. Ambient is good and I would recommend friends n family to dine at Spize.
Nice place,My second time visiting. Brought my parents for Parents Day dinner. Love the atmosphere. Crowded as usual. Food portion was huge. My family certainly enjoyed themselves.
Favourite Spize Outlet!,"A place with great ambience, delicious food & fantastic service. Made reservation through Chope & it was such an easy & hassle free experience. Thank you!"
Birthday Dinner,"It was very nice! But service could have been better, took quite a while to get staffs attention, as they were very busy."
Friendly and excellent service!,We went there (Riffle Range) in big group. The service pretty fast and the people there are very friendly. Love the ambience too!
Great overall experience,"Food 5/5, ambience 5/5. It was just perfect! Great for any events; dates, family dinner, friends. Food was high quality and the atmosphere of the restaurant was top notch. Will recommend to others and definitely pay another visit!"
Break Fast at Spize,"Without asking, they have prepared plain water and dates for us to break our fast before food was served. Great service and good food!"
Spize @ Temasek Club Best!,Good customer service... 👍 Nice ambience... ☺ Cosy place to hv a romantic dinner... 😊 Service was fast too...
Foods,Waitress/waiter dressing Looks all service are excellent me and family love this place to eat and will come down again..
Would love to come back again!,"Went there to break fast with family. Food was great, little waiting time for it to arrive, and the atmosphere was lovely. Service staff were good too! Would definitely return!"
Room for improvement,"The place has lovely ambiance and I have been there many times. The food is pretty good but there is room for improvement in customer service orientation. I was a little disappointed during this visit - attention was to our food orders and requests were cursory. We were assured that the finger food would come first but it arrived after some of us were having our main course. We ordered dessert to share and although there were 7 of us, only 4 plates were given to us and we had to help ourselves to extra plates in the end. We finished our meals and were waiting for coffee and desserts but no-one took the initiative to clear the table until we asked a couple of times. And this was not for lack of staff. There were even some resting in the lounge area outside the cafe. This is a club to cater to military officers and this slackening of good service (relative to when they first opened) is not healthy."
Scrumptious food! Good Service rendered!,Always loved to visit this place because of it's ambience and service. The food is good and delicious! Good place to meet up with friends or colleagues!
Great food,Love the high ceiling and full window panels. A bit hot in the afternoon as the sun comes in. Food is excellent!
Great value dining for family,A friend recommended me to eat at this restaurant and so I did went to try it. I have to admit I had the best food i ever had. The Burger was delicious..
"Good ambience, good food",Food was great with very reasonable price! We personally love the cod fish bok choy noodle. The kida meal are great too! Ample parking for those who are driving!😁
Rude and impatient waitress,"Just wait for someone else to complain. We need to visit there regularly. So, we don't like to comment too much. Good Luck to Spike@Rifle Range."
Spize Temasek Rifle Range,Have always love dining there. Service have nvr been disappointing. Prompt service but staffs need to smile more.
Spize,We had a great time at Spize for our farewell lunch with a colleague. Good variety at reasonable prices!
Nice ambience,Nice ambience for a relaxing dinner. The place was filled with families and office workers on the Friday night. Price of the food was reasonable.
Celebrating my parent's birthday,"I was there recently to celebrate my Parent's Birthday & both my parents really love the place there. My parent don't eat western food that much, so they ordered Asian foods. I can say the foods are all delicious. including the massive spaghetti I have ordered, this dish serve 02 to 04 pax. the waffles come with a candle if you request for it & also there is a bday song when it is being serve.

GREAT!!!,love the service... especially the peramah (socialable) staffs. love the food.... love the atmosphere...
Dining with nature,Food and ambience was really good! Worth the time driving to Temasek Club. Service was abit laggy but understandable due to the lunch crowd.
Great cosy cafe,Cosy cafe that sells many variety of food! Western and Asian cuisine. Good chill out place and esp there is a portion that is pool facing
Excellent,"Food is good quality, nice ambience and worth the money. Highly recommended. Reservations are a must!"
"Great ambience, Great Food.",I love the ambiance and the food. Thank you for the visits. I tried the barumundi and it was lovely. The mushroom soup was awesome.
Catch-up lunch,"A great place to catch up with friends with good ambience, lush greenery around the cafe, prompt service and a great selection of food. Will be back again!"
Nice and affordable dinner,"Located in Temasek Club, this gem of a find served up delectable local favourites for a very good price. I liked the fact that it was overlooking the pool, and it was a pretty romantic dinner experience at that."
Last visit to Spize @Rifle Range was disappointing,"Since my friend 1st brought me to Spize @Rifle Range, I have been going back there a few more times because I like the food and ambience there. However my last visit there was disappointing. After waiting for more than half an hour for my order of Morrocan Chicken to be served and the majority of my colleagues (there were 12 of us) has gotten their order and almost finishing their meal, I was presented with a charcoal black chicken. Shocked, I ask the waiter if this dish is meant to be this way, he agreed that it was ""bit burnt"" and took it back to the kitchen. Another staff then came over to advise that I need to wait another 15 mins or so for my order to be cooked and any other western meal will be the same - at least 15 min waiting time!!! If I order Chinese, it is faster. So I have no choice - as I cannot make the rest of my colleagues wait for me, I had chosen the Penang Char Kway Teow and it was awful. It was a bit too sweet for my liking and the colour (which comes from the dark sauce) is not the Penang kway teow that I am accustomed to. Hence it is an understatement to say I did not enjoy the food that lunch."
Nice cozy ambience,"Visited the spize restaurant during the weekday evening. It was pretty quiet with only a few tables of guests.
Ambience of restaurant was good and suitable for a date.
Food wise was good. Despite the slightly high price, the portion was pretty big and filling.
Out of the window was a view if the nearby hills and also the swimming facilities below. A quiet location with good food.
Definitely recommended for couples dating. There are also big table that can cater for 10 people, but generally place is not loud."
Good for team lunch!,"Nice venue to celebrate a team milestone. Highly recommended to make advance booking. Good food, good company and we also got a nice view of the pool"
Very nice ambience!,"We were there for breakfast on a weekday, it was quiet and nice. We were given a table with pool view. My baby loved it! The place is very nicely done up and service was good. Food was average though, we ordered American breakfast and the croissants. Highly recommend if you want a quiet, relaxing meal."
B'day Celebration,The staff was fabulous in making our group of 30 comfortable during our dining at the restaurant. Fabulous service and food!! Well done!!
Hidden gem in Bukit Timah,Full height windows overlooking lush greenery. In love with the view! Friendly service staff too. Will definitely drop by again.
Spize @ Rifle Range is simply AMAZING,"I love this place, the food's amazing, service and atmosphere is fantastic too, definitely value for money - highly recommended!"
Great variety that is easy on the pocket,"Spize offers great variety in the menu to cater to different preference. The briyani is simply perfect.
The ambience is also very relaxing and deor is very comfy. The only thing was the seating is abit too near to the next table and some of the chairs are too low for comfort. it is not very nice hearing the conversation of the next table.

Other than that, service is alright. They could do with bigger cups for water. Love the fun atmosphere there. Mayve have more healthy options for food."
