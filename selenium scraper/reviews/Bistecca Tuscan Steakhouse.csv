Excellent choice for date night or special occasions,"They do steaks, and they do them well. Lovely foccacia (crisp yet fluffy) with a unique tomato pesto that's really appetising. Fries was quite standard but the garlic aioli dip was the perfect enhancer.

A beautiful birthday dessert platter consisting Sticky Date Pudding, Panna Cotta and Classic Tiramisu, that's just too much for 2 to finish.

What really impressed me here is the service. Subtle, but absolutely on point. The server sets up a bag hanger the moment I'm seated, they draw the curtain behind you when you ask them to help with a photo, so you don't get photo-bombed in the background. They even provide sanitary pads, liners and tampons in the Ladies Washroom!"
A wonderful evening with conversation and food,"Went here on a date and I really loved the atmosphere. The food was very well prepared and the focus was surely on steaks. My date had the rib eye and said it was wonderful. I had the tuna steak which was slightly over done, but tons of flavor in the dish. Service was good.
Ok. A pet peeve of mine at nice places. If you want to pour my wine and water so you put it out of my reach, then notice my glass is empty."
Awesome dining experienced!,It was our first time to try Bistecca Steakhouse (with my girlfriend). Its our 2nd anniversary and im looking for a restaurants that offer nice steak and it was really a great experienced. Big shout out to Khai who took care of our table and he really take good care of us especially offering recommendation to us. We are surprised when he gave us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary and me and my girlfriend really appreciate this simple things restaurant pay attention especially to any special occasion. We are so full and wanna send my appreciation to everyone and to Khai who is very friendly. Definitely will come back here. Thanks!
Worth a visit if you are not on a budget,Excellent steak house!! All 3 courses were very nice. Slow cooked braised lamb soup to start was magic! Steak also great. Look the place is pricey but you get great service and exceptional food quality. Will be back.
Excellent dinner!,"We had the Burata salad for starters which was unexpectedly one of the best I‚Äôve ever had! We then had Fiorentina steak, which was full of flavour and cooked just right (medium-rare). Everything was delicious, atmosphere nice, staff friendly! Overall a top place for steak!"
Fantastic food and restaurant,"Booked a table for our wedding anniversary trip to Singapore. Beautiful restaurant, great food and excellent service. Would definitely recommend üëå thank you for making it special."
Amazing if pricey steakhouse,The Fiorentina sharing steak is the definite highlight. It is superbly done. Grilled crisply on the outside and moist on the inside. If you like your steak more cooked you must inform the chef to cook it medium. The default is medium rare and this is what. Fiorentina steak ought to be eaten. The Burrata was also incredibly cooked. One of the best I have tasted. Finally the Tiramisu was done in authentic Tuscan style. Service was top notch. Wine selection was good but they are quite pricey. A Great place for a special evening!
Great food,Food is good with a great choice. Steak chicken or pastas. Excellent service and staff are friendly and courteous. Book ahead as can be busy.
Best steak in Singapore for me,"The Florentina steak is arguably the best steak I have ever had in Singapore. Cooked to just the right doneness for me, it is so tender, juicy and flavourful. Love the Agnolotti pasta, the wonderful combination of sweat pea & pistachio blended with bursts of subtle goat cheese is simply perfect. Even the Focaccia bread is so good. Service is excellent, staff are friendly and attentive. Would not hesitate to come back."
Good Food but let down by poor staff,"Great venue, very comfortable and food was good - we chose the 1.3kgs ribeye to share and it did not disappoint. Chargeable sides were inadequate portions for the table to share. Staff really let this restaurant down - no warm greeting, no explanation of the menu, no checks to see how we were enjoying the meal.
High priced, especially for drinks.
Will not be returning to this restaurant."
One of the best set lunches in SG,"Great lunch set menu, exceptional accommodating staff, a great relaxing atmosphere from the moment your greeted at the door to being served. Hats off to Fabio, Wes, Anne, Jenna & Helmy for such awesome service. Makes coming back so much easier"
Top Place,"This place a must go for steak , in my personal.opinion it is top 3 here in SG.

The steak is perfect and everything you would like.

Price is higher than average but worth every penny paid , so do try this for the steak.

The overall restaurant is also nice for a dinner and conversation."
Juicy beefy bistecca‚Ä¶ good place for steak,"We had their anniversary set menu‚Ä¶the scallops, burrata , pasta in ragu , risotto , asparagus, Florentine Steak & wine were all solid and very good. It‚Äôs cost total about $300+ for 2 pax which is typical for Singapore steakhouse standards‚Ä¶ the steak was juicy, nicely seared and cooked to our liking.

However it somehow didn‚Äôt feel as good as Trattoria Zaza or Dall‚ÄôOste in Florence‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt have Tuscan Soup nor Crostinis..I really like the chicken liver crostinis in Florence ( Lucca‚Äôs Trattoria Singapore does a pretty good version). Hopefully Bistecca will include these iconic dishes in the future

I guess part of the problem is the pricing which is not their fault‚Ä¶ Singapore is pricey‚Ä¶ we had a bottle of Tignanello for around ‚Ç¨70+/- ‚Ä¶here is like 2x+ more expensive"
Enjoyed every second hereüëåüèª,"Walked by this neighbourhood and it looked like a nice place, so I was happy to get a table just a few days later. I don‚Äôt have any complaints at all! The food, service, ambience, EVERYTHING was greatüòã"
Poor Service and Refusal to Admit Mistake,"I had made a reservation for an important working lunch at the restaurant. On my way there, my lunch guest called me to inform that there was no reservation. My personal assistant then also called me. Upon calling the restaurant, they insisted that they had sent an automated confirmation SMS to my personal assistant's number and she duly indicated for the reservation to be canceled. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the phone number they sent the message to was in fact not my personal assistant's but someone elses. It was perhaps an honest mistake, but what was most unfortunate was the restaurant's refusal to admit that they made a mistake, and incessant efforts to blame my assistant - presumably, according to them, my assistant had forgotten her own handphone number and somehow managed to call them from a different number! It is most unfortunate that an otherwise decent restaurant provides such poor service and treats their regulars in such a fashion, especially their recalcitrance even when they clearly made a mistake. Not too fine dining."
Another excellent dining experience,Another thoroughly enjoyable experience at Bistecca. Food is always excellent and the ambience and service makes you feel like you are dining in a friend‚Äôs home. Would definitely return for another meal again!
Incredibly good!,"We had a lovely evening and dinner surrounded by peace, a lovely atmosphere and the staff is high professional. The steak incredibly tasty. We highly recommend it!!!"
"Best steak in Singapore, from what I‚Äôve tried","Really enjoy coming to this steakhouse. I would recommend the Florentine steak. The herby salt they have is a nice accompaniment. So far, I think this is my favourite steak in Singapore."
'Semplicemente delizioso',"This cosy restaurant has left a lasting impression on me!

From the moment that you make a booking to the time that your greeted by Jemma at the door, Bistecca oozes the charm and simplicity of exceptional Tuscan food. I have to say I enjoy each visit and each bite of all the delicious dishes, especially their two and 3 course set lunches.

Most of all I love the homely feel, warm and friendly service from Fabio, Shin & Wes and the other dedicated wait staff.

If you looking for a hearty meal, look no further...

Steakhouse in traditional shop house,"Great ambience and attentive service. Huge portion of sharing steak, tender and juicy. Thank you for the complementary dessert."
Lina Kharytonova,"Highly recommended! Super friendly stuuf, good wines and delicious food. Definitely will be back again"
Gorgeous Steak & Dining Experience,"A great dining experience in Bistecca. Thanks to whole team for a great evening. Especially thanks to Vincent, Chef Bing for greatest hospitality, it made our anniversary a really memorable one."
A perfect steakhouse,"Celebration with wife for birthday. Had the tartare for appetiser and Costata for sharing. The medium rare was perfectly prepared. The portion was more than enough for two pax sharing. There were 4 sauces provided to go with the steak but it‚Äôs best to have it without any sauces which will mask out the real flavour and taste of the steak.
Since it was birthday celebration the desert was complimentary. Many thanks to the folks for this.
The staff were attentive from the beginning till the end. Checking in every now and then for the food and drinks.

The food, the atmosphere and everything was great."
Amazing food period,"Basically decided to come here for our 9th anniversary dinner on the second night dining in was reopened on the 22 June!

After reading reviews online and seeing the menu, we decided to indulge and go with the 1.1kg steak.

Food was absolutely flawless.

Bruschetta so delicious but ALOT of bread so we left some to have space. The steak was perfectly cooked, great char, juicy, tender, perfect with all the sauces or just the salt.

Brussel sprouts were so damn good, roasted to perfection and the tiramisu was very lovely. Good composition, and well made.

Our drinks were also solid, one of the better bloody marys, too often bloody marys are poorly made so this one is really one of the best!

Service was friendly and attentive, nothing spectacular but we were really enjoyed ourselves sitting outside.

Beautiful food, we will be back!"
Meat heaven,"Due to covid no dine in during May 2021, we seriously miss their steak so we had a mini get together just to have it. Delivery was prompt and the meat was perfectly cooked at medium rare. Steak heaven, what more can we ask for?"
Five stars all around,"Best T-bone Florentine outside Florence. And the A4 wagyu was amazing too. We had the steaks, scallops, Brussels sprouts, fries, black forest dessert and espresso. The focaccia was on the house. Everything was excellent. They gave us a 1.1kg Tbone instead of 1.4kg. We didn't realise till they came and told us and gave the A4 wagyu on the house. This is what separates a good place from a great place. They need not have told us or even if they did, we were willing to pay for the wagyu. In short, food, service & ambience, is top class. We are glad to have chosen it for a special celebration."
Excellent Restaurant,"Made a reservation at this restaurant for my wife's birthday. Impressed with the restaurant setting, friendly staff and nice food, especially the T-bone. The dessert platter is nicely done. Will be back again."
"Favorite Steakhouse, for good reason.","This visit with family and friends marks the sixth time I've dined in at Bistecca over the years. This restaurant will always be the 'go to' for a steak fix because nowhere else does it better than them.

Since my previous visit, there is a new pasta dish on the menu, the Seppia Spaghetti, which was really well cooked; al dente and the likes, and tastes like the ocean in your mouth. For starters we also ordered the cold cuts charcuterie platter, octopus, and the burrata cheese with the chitose tomatoes. Nothing to report here as those are the mainstays and have remained consistently great thus far.

For our mains we ordered both the costata and fiorentina steak, and accompanying it are the; Brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes, fries, cauliflower, asparagus, broccolini, and caprese. Once again, the steaks are cooked perfectly, and the sides are still damn awesome.

Adam, the bartender, recommended the table some drinks. The Adams apple, passionfruit cocktail and the various gins we ordered were nothing short of amazing. It's interesting to see how a restaurant focuses so much on cocktails and still have an amazing wine menu.

Onto service, again, the staff were friendly, professional and efficient. They took effort to explain the dishes and checked back with us between each course to ensure that the food is good. Bottom line is, if you're feeling bougie and want to splurge on food, this place is for you. You'd not find a better Steakhouse in Singapore for the very expressed reasons stated above."
One of the best steakhouses in Singapore,"My girlfriend brought me here for my birthday and I have to say that I was surprised by the quality and taste of the food. The restaurant has a nice ambience but is not really good for taking photos.

The service of the staff was excellent and the food was top notch. Will definitely return to this place."
"Food is good, service is... Toilet mmm!","Booked a table to celebrate my colleague's birthday since one of them love steak!
Checked in to the table was seamless and clean menu was bought to us which is nice for a change instead of scanning QR code.

Ordered 3 Prosecco to start and 2 starter. Took ""a while"" for them to bring out the Prosecco despite we're the first table that ordered then the crowd slowly comes in. After finishing our sparkling, I seek for advise from the waiter on the wine list. Each of them told me ""pls wait for their wine connoisseur"" then we were forgotten. I've to ask at least 3 waiter before the ""wine connoisseur"" finally attend to us.

Starter food scallop was very good. Octopus was a miss. We can hardly see any octopus, more like a tomato starter. Main course ribeye and Tenderloin are very good. We had 2 dessert. Sticky date pudding is way too sweet. They were nice and brought out a slice of a very sweet Tiramisu as a birthday cake for my colleague.
Toilet was a scary affair. Ladies toilet the seat was lifted like in the men's toilet. When I tried to flush, I was shocked to see scary the toilet seat was. For an upmarket resto, they must make an extra effort to have a decent toilet. Toilet will always portray the hygiene level of them."
Satisfying meal,"Craving for steak Fiorentina saw us make our way here for dinner, with reservations made way in advance of course. We shared the 1.1kg T bone and it was delicious, cooked medium rare but closer to medium we thought. Came with four types of sauce which were all good. We had the squid ink pasta to start and was yummy. The two sides we chose were also highly recommended by the service staff. Great dining experience, memories of our visits to Florence."
Real italian quality,Great experience Great food Great service...... what else......... They have also a good choice of beers.... Try the Ipa
One of the greats.,"I've had the privilege to dine in at Bistecca on multiple occasions over the years. The restaurant has been consistently great and their innovative new dishes always offer something new between visits.My friend and I came for dinner on a Monday night and it was fully booked, not surprising given Bistecca's clout so a reminder for all to make reservations.

For starters, we had the steak tartare and the octopus. Both dishes were nothing short of amazing, just like before. For our mains we had the black pepper strip loin and the wagyu strip loin. Again, nothing to report here, steaks were well cooked and the accompanying sauces were great. The new Uni Butter elevated the steaks to a whole new level.

Onto deserts, the sticky date pudding is a must try, and the same goes for their pana cotta and pistachio cake. Long story short, you won't regret ordering any of the three mentioned in this review.

Service was attentive and impeccable, just as expected of a place of such calibre. All in all, dining at Bistecca is an experience. Not cheap. But worth every penny spent. People often compare this joint to other steak houses but at Bistecca you get what you paid for, and then more.

If you haven't been here already, make a booking. You'll find it worthwhile to indulge in a good old fashioned steak dinner with the money squirreled away for the winter ski trips that never came to be."
Amazing service by a Mr Adam,"Had the pleasure of going to Bistecca with a group of havoc fellas. The food was amazing and the service was tip top.Will definitely recommend it to friends and family, but the thing that made the experience so much better was the service by Adam. There‚Äôs no doubt I will definitely be back"
Great service,I was very impressed with the service rendered from Adam. He took great care of us for a dinner I‚Äôd gone there for my birthday. I‚Äôd just like to thank you. Steaks were absolutely perfect as well.
Adam trombetta good worker,The service was excellent. Especially mr Adam trombetta. He was friendly and catered to our every needs. Perfect staff.
Amazing service by Adam and great food!,"Had the pleasure of coming down to Bistecca with a group of friends. We were taken care of by Adam exceptionally well, food was amazing and the ambience was perfect. Great place, but the icing on the cake was the service by Adam. Will definitely come back in the future!"
Excellent excellent excellent,"Excellent excellent excellent This place is the bomb, food excellent service needs a wake up but all good"
"Poor service, disappointing experience","I would like leave a comment regarding my family‚Äôs recent visit (25th October) to the restaurant in hope that some improvement will be made for future patrons.

My family had been to Bistecca once before to celebrate my mother‚Äôs birthday, during which, we had a lovely evening. The food, especially the steak, was excellent, as was the service. The waiters were attentive and the sommelier, Wes, was friendly, pleasant, and knowledgeable about the wines. We even shared some wine together as he seemed excited and enthusiastic when he saw that we had brought our bottle of red wine by the label ‚ÄòBlank‚Äô. He mentioned that he rarely saw this bottle of wine, much less so in Singapore.

Having had a wonderful time, we decided to go back to the restaurant to celebrate my sister‚Äôs birthday. We opted to take the first seating instead of our preferred second seating on the 25th of October as bookings were not available for the second seating and were hard to make in general. Unfortunately, we were running a bit late due to heavy traffic conditions and hence I called up the restaurant to inform them of such unforeseen circumstances and to hold the table for us. The lady on the line though firm, was not very pleasant nor sympathetic and informed us of all the current policies the restaurant now had in place due to the Covid-19 situation. I understand that restaurants now have stricter timings for their patrons and stringent policies due to the pandemic. However, we as a family will not intentionally choose to be late for a celebration either.

Upon reaching there, we were hurried to place our orders and rushed throughout the entire meal. We felt that we did not have enough time to enjoy our food nor wine, let alone have a good conversation. Some waiters were not sincere in asking about us. They would ask if everything was all right and proceed to turn away quickly even before we could finish replying to them. Service was rushed and we did not even have time to have dessert, barring the fact that we had already informed the restaurant that this was for a birthday celebration. The lady maitre d (same lady whom I spoke to over the phone earlier) proceeded to tell us that our table was to be cleared by 8pm whilst we were having our mains. By then, my family had already had enough of this poor service and we asked for the cheque. While waiting for the cheque, the restaurant staff presented my sister with a slice of tiramisu and a candle. All four of us were shocked and surprised. It was a nice and kind gesture. However, how were we meant to wolf down the cake when we barely just finished our mains and wine?

Our waiter was kind in that he said we could probably sit for another 15 more minutes to have some cake. But by then, we were just unhappy and disappointed with the service and overall experience. We would not have wanted to extend our seating on borrowed time whilst waiters hovered around waiting to clear and set the table for the next seating. We had a wonderful time previously, but this second time was a complete and thorough opposite. We felt that the restaurant was literally doing a use-and-chuck for patrons in that ensuring patrons have an exceptionally enjoyable experience was very low on the restaurant‚Äôs priority. I sincerely hope that the restaurant takes this feedback seriously as I would not want other patrons to have a similar experience to my family‚Äôs. The steak is still good. However, I would not choose to return if the experience is such."
Great service - Adrian,It was our first time at Bistecca and it was an absolutely awesome experience. Adrian had excellent service and we‚Äôll certainly return again for the service! The costata steak was delicious and we had such a good time! Certainly will recommend!
Very good service and food,An unforgettable experience with many types of steak to choose from. Wine collection is also very vast. The Panacotta is excellent.
Awesome waiter,Great restaurant for a family dinner. The roast was done perfectly and our experience was made better due to a Chinese young man who pulled out all the stops to ensure my kids were kept happy throughout the meal. Unbeatable customer service and food. Will revisit again!
Our favourite restaurant,"Every year for his birthday, my husband wants to go to Bistecca. This year was no different! It has genuinely been his favourite restaurant for years so I wouldn't dare book anywhere else. Thank you guys for the birthday cake and a wonderful evening!"
"Great food, great company, great service!","Having heard good things about the quality of steaks at Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse, I was excited to celebrate the end of my internship with my friends, and I was not disappointed.

We had the scallops and octopus for starters and shared the signature steak, the Bistecca Fiorentina for our main course. Along with the steak, we ordered a side of fries and broccolini.

The food is nothing short of amazing and lived up to the expectations we had of the restaurant which is highly raved about, with the steak being absolute worth every dollar spent.

And to top the evening off, the waiter that served us that night, Vaylor, was not only very attentive, he provided spectacular recommendations that were on point and even sent us a complimentary dessert after overhearing that we were celebrating our friend's birthday.

The experience, though pricey, was worth every penny paid that night. We will not hesitate to visit again, albeit on a less frequent basis due to the high price."
Pretty bad,"Had set lunch here to celebrate my anniversary with my partner. Had almost a half an hour wait between the serving of appetizer and main course.

As a result, the restaurant was closing by the time we were finish the main course. We felt that the waiter - a bespectacled Chinese young man - was very rushed in clearing our main course, serving the dessert and bringing us the bill. I was still three-quarters through my main course when he simply placed the Tiramisu with ""Happy Anniversary"" written on the table, without saying anything. No congratulations, no ""enjoy your anniversary/meal"", nothing. And I was still eating my main course.

So we asked him to serve our other dessert, and he looked obviously confused. He did not even know that we were waiting for another dessert. So if we had forgotten about it, perhaps we wouldn't even get to eat the dessert we ordered?

That young bespectacled Chinese waiter seemed to have placed more attention entertaining his friends at the table beside us. He even asked if they wanted dessert to be served long after he hurriedly placed that Tiramisu on the table and gave us our bill.

Did it need to be so rushed towards the end of our meal, if they hadn't made us wait for half an hour between the appetizer and main course? The rush completely ruined my appetite.

The dessert (two scoops of gelato) came in such a miserly portion, the circumference of one scoop was barely more than the size of a 50-cent coin.

Overall, ambience was good and food was quite good, but portions were quite small and service was bad (perhaps it was simply that young bespectacled Chinese man). Sad to say that his actions alone may have brought down the entire team, I may never step foot in this restaurant again."
We had a brilliant dinner,"We had a brilliant dinner, big shout out to Raja and Adam - Raja was our server and made sure we were so well looked after all night, Adams innovative cocktails were delicious and made with love.. can‚Äôt recommend this place enough. Can‚Äôt wait to go back"
"GOOD FOOD, GOOD COMPANY BUT THE BEST SERVICE FROM ADRIAN","Today is my third visit to Bistecca. Their steak is good but the service provided by Adrian is the best. The reason why my partner and I went back is mainly because of the warm and fantastic service that Adrian has been providing us with. It‚Äôs a pity that Adrian is moving on. Our future Experience at Bistecca would not be the same.

Thank you so much for the great service Adrian! Take care and ciao!

Love,
Nicole & Davien"
"Good food, with a strange waiter","This place does their savories well; the octopus was not overdone but yet retained its firmness. The wild mushrooms side was absolutely delightful after mixing with the egg yolk; so creamy and fragrant! The fiorentina was delicious and grilled to a perfect pink as well, though the sauces didn‚Äôt do much to elevate the tastes as it was rather flavorful already. Steak may look small, but it was good enough to share amongst four ladies. Every slice was cut nice and thick.

As to the desserts, it was nice of them to send a complimentary tiramisu over to our birthday girl, though honestly it was nothing to shout about in terms of taste. The kind gesture is nonetheless very appreciated. The dessert we enjoyed most would be the Black Forest, which was refreshing after a heavy meal. The sticky date pudding was on the sweeter side and unfortunately we couldn‚Äôt finish it. Lovely brown butter pecan gelato though.

Overall, would come back again, and hope we don‚Äôt encounter the strange waiter again who spoke a little too fast and was slightly aggressive in his service. Wouldn‚Äôt say he was unfriendly, but his demeanor did make us a little uncomfortable in a nice setting like this. Felt like it belonged more to a casual restaurant?"
Best I‚Äôve had in Singapore,"Firstly, I am particular and to date I‚Äôve waited 10 years plus to have a steak better than Cut. But tonight was the night. That was just superb. Generally I think I can do better at home however, not going to attempt to criticise the excellent delivery of the food or service. Excellent."
Sunday Tuscan Roast Lamb,"We have't been to Bistecca in a while, but a friend mentioned their Sunday specials during ""Circuit Breaker"". Some investigation was clearly required, and I decided upon the rack of lamb. At $98 for epically cooked lamb rack, asparagus with Hollandais, caponata, roast Ratte pots and creamed spinach is an absolute steal, and it arrived bang on time today, all perfectly cooked and ready to scoff.

Definitely recommended."
dinner,ordered dinner takeaway of pasta and tenderloin. decent food quality. will be back soon for other dishes.
lovely steaks,"we came here for dinner to celebrate our 5th year anniversary, booked the sitting just the afternoon, and could only get a long sharing high table.

nonetheless, we enjoyed our steaks, wife had the tenderloin while i had the 400g angus ribeye, and we had the cream spinach and side cauliflower to share, paired with a cab sav. for dessert, we tried the sticky date pudding and added another side of vanilla ice cream gelato, and ended the night with a brandy alexander cocktail."
Exceptional Food and Service,"I recently hosted a dinner/private event for 15 people at Bistecca's La Sofitta Room on the second floor. The setting and ambience was amazing. Fabio, the General Manager, and his team were real professionals from the planning process all the way to the room set up and execution on the day. The room had perfect lighting, music and table set up. The food was, as expected, of a very high standard. Fresh ingredients, generous portions. The dedicated service staff (Christian and his colleage) on the night were excellent. They were attentive and took care of the guests very well.

I have always been a fan of Bistecca - what is not to love about their delicious food and beautiful setting in a shophouse? This time I am also impressed with their events team. If you are looking to host an intimate dinner party, I would highly recommend Bistecca."
Birthday dinner with family,"Food is nice though bit expensive. Ambience not bad but the birthday dinner seating arrangement for my family was a disappointment. Give you a feeling that they just give you a table although I have called to book days ahead for birthday.

Their business is good, hence can afford to have such attitude. This is probably the reason I hesitate to revisit or recommend my friends."
Superb steak,One of the best steaks in singapore. Awesome wine selection. Even the sides were nice and so many things I want to eat. Can‚Äôt wait to head back again.
Bistecca is a mega Mecca for Bistecca a la Fiorentina,"The best (and perhaps only?) place in Singapore for devouring bistecca fiorentina. However, for other beef cuts (eg. tomahawk, rib eye), the pieces served at the American houses (Wolfgang, Cut, even Morton‚Äôs) tend to be more flavourful. Delicious slides include pur√©e, frites, and spinach. Too bad they don‚Äôt do bone marrow dishes anymore - those were sinful but yum. Impressive list of Italian wines. Smooth service even if not extremely proactive."
Best steakhouse in Singapore,"Great service, awesome steaks and pappardelle to die for. Nice wine selection . Ask for Adrian for service and you won't be disappointed."
Post New Year Lunch Date,"On a Sunday afternoon, my boyfriend took me here for a lunch date as our post new year celebration. The place is amazing and elegantly cosy. We are welcomed and serve by a very kind staff which they provide a fabulous service.
I loved the appetizers, buratta and octupus, they were absolutely delicious. The steak was perfectly cooked, side dishes are also decent match with good bottle of red wine.
I highly recommend if you want to splurge it's fairly worth it. Thank you for a fantastic experience."
Very good experience and delicious food,"Amazing food in a pleasant ambience (great location and beautiful inside decoration).
We try the steak Fiorentina, as I heard numerous positive feedbacks about it, and we were for sure not disappointed! It was the best steak I tried during my 6y in Singapore! I will also recommend to try their deserts especially the tiramisu.
On the top of it the staff was really friendly, attentive, and offering us good recommendations about dishes and wines."
Good but meat quality far behind 5 star steakhouse such as CUT,"Very good service, nice side dishes, delicious dessert, tasty wine (but far too expensive - this is Singapore concept - double the price compared to a similar restaurant in Europe hence we just took one glass) BUT
meat quality and cooking just good, not fantastic!
Is it worth the price of this extremely pricey meat: NO.
We found it poor value for money.
Huge gap compared to CUT at MBS in term of meat flavor and quality for almost the same price!"
Typical Italian style steak house,"This Italian restaurant I have been a couple of times. The taste to me is better comparing to other big names like Larry's like Cut like Motion. Especially their signature cut - Fiorentina 1.1 kg medium rare. The waiters are all very patient and attentive. I love this place. Even my Italian friends, they all think this is a very good place. Oh also fantastic desserts as well."
"Disappointing, and rude manager","My wife and I have been to Bistecca multiple times. Usually we have a great experience but on our last visit we were quite sorely disappointed.

Despite being one of the very first guests at the restaurant we ended up waiting close to an hour for a very simple order of a steak and a side. After waiting, we were served a steak that was not at the right temperature (we ordered medium rare but were served a medium+ steak). After reaching out to the staff the manager came over to talk to us. Instead of apologizing and asking how he could salvage our experience he proceeded to argue with us about the done-ness of the steak, which only further ruined the mood and ambiance and effectively killed the nice evening my wife and I were trying to have.

Overall, a disappointing evening; when you pay $300++ for a meal you expect 5 star service, and this restaurant fell well short. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere."
Disappointing,"This restaurant has been rated very highly as a top restaurant in Singapore. I‚Äôve been before and it was excellent. This time though it was disappointing. Extensively disappointing! I had the rib eye medium rare which was tough chewy and without much taste. My wife had the striploin which was much better.

The mushrooms and broccolini were nice. The fries helping was enough for 3 people.

There are few wines below S$100 but the list is long
Service was ok. Nothing special. No one came to ask about the meal. No one said goodbye and thank you when we left. I don‚Äôt think they cared. Maybe success has gone to their head

The atmosphere is nice. A long narrow restaurant with tasteful understated decor.

Altogether it was ‚Äúok‚Äù but not worth the money. I was disappointed having seen the reviews and having eaten there before."
Fantastic lunch set,"We had their 3 course lunch set on a Saturday for my birthday.
Service was a little slow to take orders. I shared my empathy with the wait staff with being understaffed and not easy to find wait staff, and was informed 2 staff were on MC. He promptly returned after taking our orders with 2 glasses of champagne with his apologies. Good recovery.

Started with yellow fin tuna tartare, which I thoroughly enjoyed, while the wife had the pumpkin soup, which she felt was a little too sweet.
We both had the 150g Tasmanian grass-fed beef strip loin, and was recommended to go with one side of fries and the salad, which was a good call. We also tried their char-grilled asparagus, and found it complimented the strip loin nicely.

We finished with a pistachio panna cotta and a tiramisu, both were simple and delightful."
Excellent meat in a nice place.,"Excellent meat in a nice place. The service was good even somewhat long, reason why I put only 4 stars."
Meh,We went for lunch and chose the set menu. It was just meh. It wasn‚Äôt cheap - friend‚Äôs business picked up but I would have happily paid. However the food was at most a 3*. The real problem was the speed. Very. Slow. Very. Very. Very. Slow. Also the wine was meh and very expensive.
The perfect steak,"We went there for lunch and still could not resist to order the Costata Steak, a grade 6 marbled wagyu bone in ribeye. I don't often use the word perfect, but here this fantastic peace of meat was perfect. At 1.1 kg, not much else we could try, but this alone is woth a trip."
I don‚Äôt get it....,"I strongly suggest before your visit that you properly consult the menu (specifically the portion sizes) and either fast for a day in advance or make sure you‚Äôre dining with people who want to share the same menu choice as yours.

I love Ribeye steak but if you want to enjoy one here, you‚Äôll have to order a 480g one; that‚Äôs the smallest - and only - cut they offer. Who, short of Dwayne Johnson, goes out for a meal and willingly eats half a kilo of cow?! My waiter agreed it was a ‚Äòhuge‚Äô piece of meat but his manager, on my asking if he could offer a smaller portion of food, declined on the basis that all their steak was pre-cut. Whatever that means.....

So in order to eat something sensibly sized enough that it wouldn‚Äôt choke a donkey - and allows you room to avoid pointlessly ordering a starter and a side you‚Äôd otherwise have no room for - you‚Äôre compelled to choose a steak you don‚Äôt want. Makes no sense; the customer has to compromise on choice or invite needless expense and waste of food (I don‚Äôt do doggie bags) to get what they want.

The steak I didn‚Äôt really want was well prepared enough when it turned up but unremarkable. The staff were full of good intent, so long as you stuck to the restaurant‚Äôs rules but the moment those rules were challenged, the service fell to mediocre - they knew we weren‚Äôt coming back and, I guess, responded accordingly.

All in all, disappointing - especially for our Anniversary celebration.

Go to MPW‚Äôs place next door instead."
Great steak and cocktails,"Went for dinner and ordered the Fiorentina. Fantastic t-bone cut, charred to perfection. Wagyu tartare is served with a raw egg in the centre and is delicious.

Drinks are amazing and props to the mixologist Adam. He makes amazing cocktails, love the Leather & Lace. Shame that he doesn‚Äôt want to work with pandan any more though!"
Superior dining experience,"Ok this restaurant is not for you if your looking for a cheap feed. The staff are very professional and welcoming. The menu is very well presented with a number of options to choose from. The sides are large and stalks are some of the best . The distinctive char and smoky seasoning is a specialty of this place. Wine list is also very good and priced well for Singapore.
I highly recommend it and is far more superior to some of the other well known steak places in Singapore.
I found the whole experience very good and enjoyed the complimentary Lemoncello at the end of my meal."
My Go-To Steakhouse !,"Selected this place based on reviews about the delicious Tuscan chargrilled steak.

We ordered the 1.1kg bone-in ribeye Costata, one of their two signature sharing steaks. Prepared in traditional Tuscan style over a high temperature wood-fired grill, it's charred crust yet tender and juicy centre outshines every other steakhouse I've been to across continents in my last 15 years of travel!

Undoubtedly, one of the best ever had, my go -to steakhouse!"
A little underwhelming,It was okay. I had expected something more mindblowing based on reviews. The steak was a little too dry.
Straightforward quality great tasting food,"Agreeing with some of the reviewers that their steak is one of the best in town, great cut, great meat and cook to perfection releasing awesome natural flavour. Had a great squid ink linguine too. All pair with great Italian wine by the glass. That's how it shd be, Italian restaurant with great Italian wine, white or red."
Very good,Still a super experience. The steak is sensational. But the price‚Äî and relative value for the money is ridiculous
Tuscan Birthday treat,"After extensive research, I picked this place for my birthday treat based purely on reviews about the delicious chunky chargrilled steak, done Tuscan style.

There were only two of us and we ordered the 1.1kg bone-in ribeye Costata, which was one of their two signature sharing steaks, the other being the 1.1kg T-bone Fiorentina (both cost SGD188/¬£111/‚Ç¨123/USD139/¬•15,025). The Costata was succulent and juicy, and we even tried to carve out every morsel to ensure we didn‚Äôt waste any bit of the meat. (Yes, we felt rather barbaric but we were happy.)

We also ordered the spinaci (creamed spinach) and insalata (leafy greens), which were tasty and excellent accompaniments.

We were too stuffed to order any dessert. But then the staff knew it was my birthday and surprised me with a nicely plated complimentary dessert (the bill later revealed that it actually cost SGD12, just so that we knew).

It was a lovely lunch because of the following:

1) Fabulous steak
2) Excellent side dishes
3) Gorgeous bread served at the start of the meal
4) Attentive service and wonderful recommendations
5) Lovely ambience and decor, including the beautiful paintings."
Good steak,"The steaks were good, florentine came in a sizeae portion for sharing. The tenderloin was well seasoned too. Service was prompt and good."
Delivers as usual.,"Having dined in here on multiple occasions for dinner, I decided to bring my colleagues here for lunch as they told me that they were craving for steak. From my past visits, I knew that reservations are a must in order to reserve a table. When we arrived, the crowd started to stream in and by the time we were done, the restaurant was full.

Having lunch here is different from dinner. But two things still remained unchanged, the quality of the food and the level of service rendered. The waitstaff were quick and efficient in ensuring that the waiting time between courses are kept to a minimal; had to rush back to work, l digress.

One thing that stood out was that the menu has undergone some changes. Almost all categories had new dishes, but the crowd favorites remains unchanged. Which is great.

Onto the food, I had the three course set lunch menu. I started with the octopus, which was tender and soft, some tweaks were done to this dish but it was still awesome. My colleague had the Kale soup, and she commented on how tasty the soup was. Onto the mains, the Rib-eye and Strip-loin me and my colleague ordered respectively was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. My other colleague that ordered the Pollo was astounded by how soft the chicken was, a quick chat with Adam revealed that the chicken was sous-vied. Lastly, for deserts, the Pana Cotta, Tiramisu and the Sticky Date Pudding was ordered and shared between us three. The Stick Date Pudding is phenomenal and a must try for diners with a sweet tooth.

Overall, the we really enjoyed ourselves and appreciate how Adam, Helmy and Eddie delivered exceptional service despite it being really crowded."
"Without a shadow of a doubt, best steak on the island","I love medium rare steak and grew up with frequent visits to Italy as my father lived there, and I have to say Bistecca did not disappoint with their Tuscany inspiration.

Ive been there more than once, tried both the Florentine and Tenderloin, and its absolutely melt-in-the-mouth perfect.

The sides such as veggies are also extremely tasty - every dish is packed with flavours and when added together on one plate, its just incredible.

If you have a sweet tooth, try the Sticky Date Pudding. trust me!"
Nice place off Orchard...,"Nice place. Hotel recommended. The strip steak was nice and properly cooked. I had the polenta side and the mozzarella starter. The starter is huge so be prepared to share. The portions are good and the dessert was the toffee bread pudding. Nice.
I would recommend. Reservations a must. The servers did a great job. They all cross over and help all the tables. So you‚Äôre never looking for your server. They all help each other."
Brilliant STEAKS and COCKTAILS!,"Went with my husband last Saturday for dinner, first time here .Absolutely recommended ! Food was amazing and cocktails were simply spectacular and well balanced .Great service as well.Will be back for sure ."
Steak at its best,"Great cold cuts as appetiser : probably the best prosciutto I ever tried.
This was followed by a bistecca equivalent to the best you might find in Florence.
Great atmosphere and service as well !
Can‚Äôt ask for more
Definitely a must visit if you like meat !"
Best steak in a LONG time,"We noticed this place just walking around the neighborhood and thought we'd try it. Wes, the maitre'd of the night, guided us to a table. My partner and I were not so hungry and decided to share. Wes suggested an off-menu eye of round with bone that was bigger than the single portions but smaller than the 'meal for two'. It was perfect. Just wish I had more time in SG to try them again."
Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse Singapore review by David Papkin,"Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse review by David Papkin.Excellent Italian steak house in Singapore. Staff superb, friendly western GM Dani, knowledgable bartender Adam, waiters Gaylor, also very knowledgable wine steward. Italian bread served with complimentary pate and itailan olives, crisp large asparagus spears, flavorful cold cut platter, and fantastic 1.1 KG t-bone steak. Italian wine selection, had Tenuta Guado Bolgheri 2015 red wine from their impressive cellar. For dessert, tiramisu. Steak very tasty, perfect medium rare. The dessert just right for 2 and limoncello apertif. Highly recommended, great that they have managed to keep the quality high, even after being in Singapore for some years. Highly recommended steak house! End of David Papkin Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse Singapore"
Delicious!!!,"Ate at Bistecca last night with my wife and 19 year old daughter. 1st time there but won't be our last. We ordered the Fiorintina steak and it was the best steak I have tasted in a long time. So soft as well. At 1.1kg I thought it would feed all 3 of us but to be honest its just good for 2 people. The bone must take up alot of the weight as we normally eat about 8 oz to 12 oz steaks and can barely finish them but we ate this up in no time so not sure how many oz's you actually get. The staff were very friendly, couldn't ask for better. It felt really nice and elegant with the decor. It was a bit loud but was just the sound of alot of people enjoying themselves and not quiet and boring. Great atmosphere. Easy 5 stars for me."
Best steak in Singapore,"Loved the ambiance and service at this restaurant. We ordered the large rib-eye to share and it was very good. I generally avoid ordering steak in Singapore as it usually isn't very good but Bistecca Tuscan does a great job with the steak. We enjoyed all of our sides except for the asparagus which was very under-cooked and hard. We had trouble cutting the spears even with a knife. The wine list is quite good and they give great recommendations. As the restaurant is quite pricey, this is a great place for a special night out."
Awesome,Awesome ambience and great meat! Thats all you basically need to know. The wine selection is good two. Bistecca offers a wide range of meat and delicious side dishes. I would recommend the Tenderloin and the Wagyu. You should have a reservation because it might be fully booked. An awesome steakhouse! We will come back!
"""Once you eat a steak here, you won't go elsewhere!""","Undoubtedly, one of the choice steaks, if not the best ever had. What makes them stand out even more is that you get the whole deal at Bistecca. From the first point of contact with the hostess to the final minutes, the entire team truly made us feel special and catered to every possible need. Professionalism, class and style are their hallmarks. Bistecca outshines every other steakhouse we've been to across continents in the last 10 years of travel!"
Favourite Steak Place,"Went once and was sold. I make it a point to come back at least once a year, just for the Florentine steak. Although the last time I was visited, the chicken pate that came with the bread wasn't as fantastic as I remembered."
Great steak. Good value for money,Got a bad table at the beginning but could easily change. Very good steak. Not too expensive. Definitely recommended. Some waiters miss the attitude to work in a top restaurant.
Good meat but slightly pricey,"I ordered both the recommended thick cuts - the Bone-in Ribeye and T-bone. I personally prefer the Ribeye more than the other. The meat was tender and flavorful. We can taste the woodish flavour on the meat itself. A wonderful experience for a good weekend gathering dinner, however the price is slightly on the pricey side, so please prepare for it :)"
Great steak in town,Interesting place in town. Lucky to get street side parking Friendly and patient staff Steak cooked just right
Valentine‚Äôs Day Dinner,"My husband and I celebrated our first Valentine‚Äôs day dinner here as a married couple. It was our third visit last month and I can say that among all the must-try steakhouses here in Singapore, Bistecca consistently delivers the best personlized service to their guests regardless if it‚Äôs a quiet meal period or if it‚Äôs crunch time. Special thanks to ‚ÄúJenna‚Äù for assisting us from booking a nice corner table up to arranging special desserts with wordings of our wedding hashtag to end our meal. We really enjoyed our dinner. They also have a sommelier if you are unsure which wine to order from their master list. My husband and I are steak aficionados and this place did not let us down. Their fiorentina steak, pan-seared scallops and black forest are my personal favourites! Will definitely be back soon to try other items on their menu."

Thanks to the staff for the superb meal & service,"My family celebrated my daughter`s entry into her university, and came to this restaurant for lunch.

The `Sharing portion` rib-eye steak and the lamb rack was beautifully done! The steak juicy and delightfully medium-rare pink, and the lamb was deliciously medium done as well. The wine list was also very extensive.

Service was attentive and friendly, and the decor was homely and comfortable.

All in all, a great dining experience and the food was delicious. Well worth the trip, and two thumbs up!"
üëçüëçüëç,Excellent food and great Gin and tonic recommendations and service by tattooed bar-man. Will be back for sure.
Disappointing Experience!,Was there to celebrate a birthday but the restaurant marred the occasion. Wait staff was constantly harassing us to leave by the stipulated time. Food was nothing to rave about & way too pricey. Regretted my decision & to think I booked the restaurant almost a month in advance. There are definitely better places to enjoy such food!
Just the way I like my steak,"Ever since I discovered the bistecca fiorentina in Florence, Italy, it became an obsession until I found the Costata at this place on Mohd Sultan some years back. Dining here is a splurge but well worth it considering how beef is invariably hit-and-miss in most regular restaurants. We had spinach and mushrooms for sides, the can't go wrong options to soothe our conscience for a balanced diet.
Food raving aside, I found the service a little confusing. Wouldn't hurt to take it up a notch or two."
"Good steaks, good service, annoying two seating's","The place to go if you like a good steak without paying over the top. Atmosphere is nice, with warm lighting. Service is excellent. We were however surprised about the ''two seatings'' policy - first seating at 6pm, second seating at 8.15pm. They do themselves a lot of disfavor as the restaurant was not full at all - and this on a Friday night. If you don't mind to be told when to eat - go and enjoy. This is a good restaurant. My compliment to the chef for the pasta dish with oxtail ragout which I had for first course. The best pasta dish I had in a long time."
When you miss a good steak...,The food was superb. Great ambience and solid service. If you are craving for the Florentine steak from Italy this will do the trick. Much recommended.
Delicious!!!,We went here with friends for dinner. Amazing food and service . Very nice ambiance. We had the Fiorentina and Maiale Berkshire Pork chop the food was delicious!
