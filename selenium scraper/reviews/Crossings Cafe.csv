A worthy eating trip to Crossings,Good service n staff are very efficient n alert to the needs of its customers. The handicapped too are awesome. Kudos to Crossings Cafe.
Heartwarming. Comfort food.,"We should have more cafe to enable the special needs. Reasonable good options with reasonable price but very generous portion. Taste pretty good, though hope it can be less salty. Would strongly suggest them to reduction the portion to reduce food waste as most of us cannot finish, can keep the same price!"
Wonderful place with lovely servers!,"Such a wonderful place with the servers who provide good service to us. Nice environment, bright and welcoming, pretty decent food. Its a cozy environment for friends and family members to gather. Food prices are pretty ok too."
Nice Experience,Food was good and it is advisable to make a reservation. Servers were friendly too. My family ordered 3 shepherd pies and I had the laksa. Food that is close to our hearts. Highly recommended if you have not been there before.
Excellent food and service,"Greatful for supporting crossing cafe social enterprise. Pls come and support them. Great food, great people."
Crossings Cafe,Very pleasant experience and Excellent ambiance with friendly staff. Will visit again. Highly recommended
Crossings Cafe,"Food is good. Price is reasonable. Always happy to see special people being treated as normal. Love the ""pay it forward"" initiative ... heart warming."
"Good food, nice location and helpful staff",Yummy food. Attentive staff. A quiet place in the town area. Artsy vibes all around. Reasonable priced.
Eat with a good cause,A great cafe that serves humble food to employ under privileged staff under their NGO banner. Truly a non profit social enterprise
Great food & atmosphere!,"Crossings Cafe offers a bright, cheerful and cosy atmosphere for a meal. It also has a nice selection of Trappist Ales sure to satisfy the most discerning of palates."
5 stars! Wonderful and warm dining experience,"It was the first time dining here for my wife and I. We really enjoyed our experience! The staff were all so friendly and helpful; it’s refreshing to see this warm atmosphere all-round. Fr Paul happened to be there as well, whom we had a great time connecting with (I liked his pina colada recommendation). 5 stars especially for the chicken satay which was meaty and tasty! We even ordered one more portion of that for takeaway. I loved the truffle mac and cheese as well as the mushroom soup too. The Good Shepherd’s Pie was delicious as well! All profits go to charity here which made our experience even more meaningful. Thank you Crossings Cafe! We will definitely be back again soon."
Great time with friends at Crossings,We went to Crossings because we wanted to support the cafe. The food is good value for money and the staff were very attentive. Drinks especially the beer were good!
Affordable and Pleasant,"Since reading about this cafe on the Catholic newsletter, I have yearned to check out what it has to offer. I managed to savour its dishes one evening and I was not disappointed.

Not too busy the evening I was there with my companion, being a weekday; we had our choice table. The ordering process was easy enough, check the boxes from a list and call for the server; who would then run through your list before sending it off to the kitchen. I started my dinner with the Onion Soup followed by the Chicken Parmigiana and Ondeh Ondeh Cake. A Root Beer Float, so satisfying, completed my meal.

The soup was flavourful with hips of onion slivers. I am used to having cheese with it, but the menu did say it was a twist of a familiar recipe, so I left it as that. The chicken cutlet was well cooked and was a large piece, most certainly value for money. It was accompanied with a generous side of fries. The drizzle of tomato sauce made it a little tangy, nicely done. I liked that the cake had plenty of coconut shavings but the texture was a little hard, probably because it had been in the cake counter for awhile.

The service provided was pleasant and non-intrusive. It is nice knowing I would have a cafe to go to whenever I am in the vicinity."
Father Paul Staes cocktail is good,A very Catholic experience with the priest present during the meal itself. Really enjoyed myself....
Good Food for a Good Cause,"I dined at this cafe many times with friends. It's a cozy cafe right in the middle of town. It is a social enterprise serving delicious food at affordable prices. All profits will be channelled to charitable causes. My favourite dishes are the laksa, the nasi lemak, burger. A great place to enjoy good food while having great conversations with friends or family members."
Excellent cafe with great food and staff,The food was excellent. Very comfortable cafe setting. Staff has displayed excellent service! Loving the açaí bowl and coffee there. Will be back to try other food items.
Pleasant Dining Experience with Social Good,This is a gem of a cafe. Good food and pleasant ambience. At the same time supporting social enterprise. Note that patience is highly recommended as some staff may forget or be slow with requests. Reservations also recommended as it can get quite busy
"Great food, great cause",Food is excellent. Belgian beer selection even more so! Staff are friendly and attentive. Go for a Friday dinner and you may meet Fr Paul Staes who doubles up as Barman! Will be ordering a cocktail the next time i am there..
Good place to catch up with friends,Food is nice. I ordered the burger which is yummy but the coleslaw is too salty for my liking. It would be better if they have a wider selection of cakes .
Friends n Buddies,"We had dinner here but forgot to book ! We just had it wait until a table cleared (about 20 mins) We had baked salmon , beef Japanese rice and Bacon panacotta ! Cheap and good and not many tables so quite cosy place and they hire staff who are autistic too !"
TreAt,"What a treat?! Finally get to try this cafe after passing it for sometime. Great warm and friendly service from the moment I enter. Apparently, the menu changes every few months. Usual cafe food and some home cooked dishes too. Something for everyone in the family, good portion and mostly great taste."
huge portions,"Quiet cozy cafe which is also a social enterprise, the portion of food served was generous. My friends and I love the shepherd pie and ondea ondea cake. Very near MRT."
"Good value for money, our support makes a difference",Crossings is a social enterprise. The set meal was value for money. Service was good. Desserts were nice.
Good food for a good cause,"I had dinner here recently with a group of friends after a long period of not having seen each other. The restaurant had decidedly simple interior furnishings, nothing fancy, but a comfortable vibe. And its menu comprised both Western and Asian dishes, with a number of items being a hybid of both cuisines. I chose the clams in white wine sauce for starters and the pan-seared barramundi for my mains, and both were extremely tasty. It's also interesting to note that the restaurant is a 'social enterprise', with all profits being channelled into free meals for various charities. Now if that's not a good enough reason to go there again, I don't know what is."
Friendly service & generous servings,The staff are very polite & helpful. Food is so-so however the serving is generous. I order a set meal with 1 side & 1 dessert. I would have though that the serving would be small as it comes with the set. The truffle fries & burnt cheesecake is full serving & I can't finish both!! Very generous!! An ideal place for family or friend's gathering!! I will visit again!!
Excellent meal,"Had lunch here and the Alaska was excellent, my son had the fish and chips which was also very good. Both were very reasonable priced and were a good portion. Also I have to add the chocolate cake is the best I have ever had. The service was very good and it is for a very worthwhile project"
Good service,"The staff were pretty attentive and the food were decent. We had the shepard pie and pan seared barramundi, with an ondeh ondeh cake. We took advantage of the burpple deal where mains were at one for one."
Cosy Cafe with Free Wifi,"Crossings is located behind the Singapore Art Museum at the ground floor of the Catholic Centre. On the menu is a small selection of burgers, pasta, entrees such as fish and chips, popular local one dish meals such as laksa curry noodles, and snacks like chicken wings, truffle fries and brownies. It is a nice place to spend time catching up with friends for a quiet conversation, and it is heartwarming to know that the cafe provides employment to disadvantaged communities.

I have visited Crossings Cafe several times, mostly to order meals for takeaway and most recently to meet up and dine with two of my best friends. I recommend the chilli crab pasta and the shepherds pie, both of which are hearty, flavourful and scrumptious dishes that I would happily order again. During my visit in August 2020, I opted for the miso pork burger, a fusion creation with sauteed pulled pork stuffed between two fluffy bun halves. Instead of the conventional sides of fries and salad/slaw, the pork burger is given a local touch and served with shrimp crackers and pickled sticks of carrot, cucumber and pineapple (see photo). A satisfying, fuss free meal, though I could barely detect the taste of miso in the pork, so my worry that it would be a tad too salty was totally unfounded.

My friend was pleased with the signature Franciscan burger, with a juicy beef patty and a sunny side up egg. The other friend had the seafood laksa which was a generous portion of rice noodles, bottleneck clams, shelled shrimp and sliced fishcake in a mildly spicy curry gravy, with extra sambal chilli served on the side to cater to those who prefer more punch in their curry.

Service is polite, earnest and efficient. Anyone visiting the Art Museum and the National Museum in the vicinity, and is craving some comfort food in a pleasant, quiet environment can just stroll over to Crossings Cafe.

"Good Value, Great Portions","Crossings cafe has a great menu, a good mix of Western and Asian choices to cater to both palettes. They serve a mean Shepard's pie that really fills the tummy for any meal of the day. Most of all, as my title says, it's the portions that are really generous. (Maybe for the dishes I've ordered, not sure about the rest), but if you need a great weekend place to grab brunch with friends and family, definitely give Crossings Cafe a try. Thereafter, you have access to many nice shopping or sight-seeing spots which are just a few bus stops away or even walk-able to.

Do note, it's a eatery that has staff with special needs, so do be kind and patient if your order might be a little long or something was forgotten. So far though, for the times I've been there, every staff there has been great, super nice and the service is top-notch."
Back for another visit,I came back here in Feb for another lunch with a colleague. I like this place as usually it's not too busy and there's no issue getting a table. Good food and friendly service - also good to be helping to support some of their social objectives. Hope to be back once the virus situation has improved.
Crossings worth a revisit,"Had the mushroom soup and found it to be thick and creamy. Looks like they were generous with the truffle oil. Had the signature black pepper and chilli crab linguine and it was nice and spicy! Be wary of the ginger beer, it was more beer than ginger. Worth a revisit!"
"Awesome food, Awesome Ambience","Everything in the restaurant is nice. Try the set meal. And, Trappist beer!! It’s good to support the social mission."
Good meeting place !,"This little gem is hidden near SMU easy access by bus and mrt . It is a quiet and comfortable air-conditioned place with delicious food, reasonably priced.
Asian and Western cuisine for breakfast and lunch .
Selection of coffees and teas hot or cold and others drinks
Good place to work or read alone or meet with friends to discuss projects ."
"Great experience, great food!",Lovely friendly service and very good food at affordable prices! We had burgers and the meat patties/buns were tasty! Will be back!
value for money,a really nice place to be and enjoy the foods. Portion is good and value for money. Highly recommend for people to meet up to dine and chill out.
Being forgotten in an empty place,The cafe was empty I was seating alone for a quick coffee. I waited 15 mins before asking for it second time. They had forgotten my order ... Bad client service in a place that looks like a staff cantine ...
Must try; and try again,"You are spoilt for food choices when you are in the vicinity of Waterloo and Bencoolen Streets. But you must give Crossings Café located at the Catholic Centre on Waterloo Street, a try.

For a small café – let alone a social enterprise – it has a very wide menu of different food choices: from hearty soups to healthy but substantial salads, burgers curated by a local Franciscan priest, pasta with a local pepper crab twist to laksa and yong tau foo. There are even a few variants of Japanese curry rice!

Besides the good cause of profits going to charity, Crossings’ staff are from disadvantaged backgrounds. That they try a lot harder, is not only evident in their service but in their generous food portions. My clam chowder has clams in every spoonful. My fish and chips was also well garnished with a proper helping of greens; and not a few pretentious leaves.

Once in a while, I’d spoil myself with a mac and cheese; and Crossings Café didn’t disappoint with the classic two forms of cheese sans the curdle: oven-baked gooey crust on the top and beneath it, the smooth creamy melt integrated with the macaroni. Although mac and cheese is relatively easy to make yet hard to master, I would count Crossings’ as one of the most satisfying I’ve eaten.

Crossings’ main dishes are neither expensive nor cheap. But I like the fact that their soups are very nicely priced only at $5; for you to contemplate a starter but not desire a set lunch.

The extensive menu of Crossings is obviously curated by a foodie – what I would want in my own restaurant – and deserving of repeat visits to eat through their spread: give it a try and go back again."
service & value for money,Experience was excellent and was served by Fr Paul. Learn about humility and will go back again and this place is so welcoming.
Food quality average,"Do not expect a high quality food here. It is oily and quite fatty. But cost is as per expected. The barramundi fish was quite nice (aspargus with mashed potatoes). The service were ok. Happy to see such social entreprise in Singapore, thumb up for that."
For a Good Course (Cause),"The food are not as great, but the fact that all profits goes to charity deserves 5-stars. Staff are friendly too."
service & value for money,the service is excellent and they serve with cheerfulness and joy. Great place to dine and catch up with friends. Foods were nice and the portion of foods were great and valued for money.
Great place for meet-up!,"Came here for a meal with my friends. We had a 1-for-1 discount coupon and had a chance to order and try 4 different mains. Was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food served. Food portions are good and food tastes on point. Would recommend the mac and cheese, seabass and chilli crab pasta. Thanks to the coupon we had, the price per person for 4 mains was about $13. Usual price of food here range about 15-20 dollars per main."
Good food. Meaningful visit,The laksa was very tasty. Good value too with 3 big prawns. The wait staff tries hard despite their challenges Very meaningful to have opportunity to support this non-profit.
Lunch at Crossings Cafe,My first time here earlier this month with a colleague for lunch. Quite ok food and reasonably efficient service. Not too busy and easy enough to get a table. Good value for money when using the Burpple app.
Cozy family dinner,"Came here once for coffee with friends from a nearby church last year. Decided to bring the family to have a meal om sunday evening. We thought it would be crowded but pleasantly surprised it was quieter than expected, with a few other families and couples. There was some take aways orders too.

We tried the grilled sea bass, chilli crab pasta (there was a deep fried soft shell crab on top), bangers & mash, pork ribs and a vongole soup. Every item was done well and we enjoyed what we ordered. We were quite full do only tried one dessett - hot lava cake with ice cream. The service staff were friendly, helpful, responsive and courteous. Spoke with the staff manning the cashier and he said its usually quiter on sunday evenings, their busy hours are lunch every day and saturdays thru out. The restaurant is located near SMU, Nafa, churches and wighin the city civic and historical district. Its also near bras basah and bencoolen mrt stations. We should come back again with friends. Fyi, the restaurant is a Catholic social enterprise and all profits are channeled to charities - which is so meaningful."
Eat with meaning,"The menu has expanded.. everything on the menu is tasty and prices are reasonable.
This is a social enterprise, and all the staff are in some way or another, marginalised or impaired, but they are very humble and polite, work hard and always trying their best to excel in customer service.
All we need is a bit of patience with them, and everyone has an enjoyable time eating and being well served.
Definitely recommend anybody visiting Singapore to have a meal there and be part of this meaningful social enterprise."
Lunch get-together with cousins,We had a nice lunch gathering in this pleasant restaurant where part of the proceeds are for charity. It’s very convenient to get to because it is near the Bras Basah MRT station. They serve delicious Western food and the staff were very pleasant
Decent Restaurant in the city,"Been a while since last time I visited the restaurant. So glad they have added some new menus to the restaurant, and yet the price still affordable for a decent meal.

We ordered Mac&Cheese it was super creamy and yummy, and you can taste the truffle oil there. Very recommended for those who are cheese lover.

Their new menu, Chicken Rolade also not disappointing, the mashed potato so smooth and chicken perfectly cooked and marinated.

All their profits will 100% go to charity"
Crossings Cafe,Excellent service and the food is spectacular and fresh. I was pleasantly surprised with the ambience.
Good food and people,"Had several meals and snacks here. Run but the Catholic church where all profits go to Charity. Food is good, cheaper than lots of places and staff lovely."
For a good cause,"I have been wanting to visit since I heard so much about this social enterprise restaurant.

The food is good and serving is generous. Drinks menu is limited.

You tend not to have too much expectations for service but this is all for a good cause since all profits go to charity."
Just lunch,Had lunch after our visit to the National Gallery to view done lighting arts as well as a water colour exhibition. A comprehensive menu comprising both local and western types of food. We had laksa and curry chicken with rice. Both were excellent. Service was excellent as well. Conveniently located within the cultural district I believe this cafe should be a draw for people working in the vicinity.
Quality food with Charitable Cause,"It’s a cosy social enterprise cafe tucked at the corner of Waterloo. The quality of the food is excellent and the quantity is more than sufficient. As I tucked in, I feel comforted that whilst I was enjoying the food, someone else would also benefit."
Social enterprise cafe,"Crossings is located in a quiet street, near to Bras Basah MRT station. They have a selection of Asian and Western food. Service is warm and attentive even though they have special needs staff. Enjoyed the tender lamb shank."
Basic breakfast,"Great little place if your looking for a quick breaky before heading out. Nice atmosphere. Food is basic and very very reasonable prices, I got a ham and cheese omelette for $5. The best thing is all profits go to charity !!"
Hidden gem,Quaint cafe for a nice meal or tea with friends. Waiters are friendly and efficient. The prawn aglio oglio & the crossings hot fish burger were delicious. Worth a 2nd visit 😊
"OK if you are Hot, Hungry and Thirsty!","Located at a busy crossroad in Orchard Road, this cafe is a good place to watch people passing by. It offers Happy Hour and a selection of beers and wines, as well as a selection of food. We shared a BLT Ciabatta which was good, and each had a Tiger Beer which was better. Not a memorable place but OK if you are hot, hungry and thirsty."
Nice place for casual lunch,Great location to meet friends for a casual lunch. Set lunch from $10 and most mains below $20. Food was good and service was surprisingly prompt. Will definitely visit again.
Nice place for coffee and a chat,This is a nice place for coffee and chat. There is a wide variety of food options but the food quality is average.
lot of food options,one can get variety of food and juice to choose . i however choose to have juice as veg options were limited
A modest cafe but the food ain't shabby!,"Was there two evenings ago with a friend. We were both sufficiently hungry and yet disciplined enough to not over-order. So I chose the LAKSA. It came in white porcelain bowl filled to the rim with noodles and ingredients.
It did not have all the usual laksa trimmings but the gravy carried the dish and it was delicious. This was washed down by a small bottle of Perrier.

Clearly a social enterprise that provides opportunities for those with less noticeable disabilities and youths-at-risks....it was a very pleasant venue for a nice tete-a-tete.

And because of its noble cause of giving back to the community in manifest ways, yes, I will be back and will bring my friends!"
Food at good value,"It's a nice place to chill out on a hot afternoon. We walked past this and decided to give it a go. Food and drinks are sat reasonable prices , as well as for a good cause. The coffee was commendable , nicely complemented with coffee art."
"Cozy, comfortable and cool","A lovely place to take a break for lunch or tea, away from the afternoon heat. The chef recommended chili soft shell crab pasta was appealing and appetizing. Away from the busy part of town and peaceful place to chill."
What a wonderful cafe and social concept,The food is good and service excellent but what is most amazing is that this is a training facility for individuals with disabilities- a safe venue to interact. Will certainly come back again. The food is inexpensive too.
Repeat visit - just to try the new miso pork belly,Came again to see the slightly updated menu and of course to support our favourite social enterprise. Chilli Crab Pasta was still a hit and chips for the kids!
Going Strong,Brought a friend here for lunch and drinks. We were served by a young lady with learning challenges but she did her job well. My friend was impressed by the service and the work opportunities given to people with learning challenges. Well done.
Church run - good food,"The food is good. We have been there twice for breakfast and lunch. Choice for breakfast is limited - but pancakes are good. The choice for brunch/ lunch is enormous from local/ western and italian dishes. Must go
It is simple place run by a church"
"Casual, Comfy & Charity","A great central locale for everything

Ordered the berry ribs (moist and succulent), chili crab pasta (what a kick), cottage pie (comforting) and potato dippers (sinful)

Great service from Irfan!

And it's a social enterprise cafe and what is better to pay for good food for a great cause !"
"Good food, good value, great service","My wife told me that this restaurant is run as a 'social venture' but as a dining experience that was an irrelevant issue. The service from the time we entered to the time we paid the bill and left was professional, warm and effective. The menu is varied with both Asian and non Asian varieties. I found it difficult to choose and resolved to visit again. My Asian beef dish was excellent served as it was with miso soup accompaniment. My wife had coffee with her meal but I settled for warm water and my glass was refilled a number of times. The venue is open, clean and pleasant. Strongly recommended."
Great service!,"We only went by for an afternoon coffee but the service was so good! The staff were kind, patient and very attentive to refill our water whenever it was low. Will definitely visit again!"
"Have a meal, have a heart!","Went to this social enterprise for a relative's birthday lunch with 11 others, Crossings Cafe being the first visit for most of us. We were seated in 2 rows of 6, facing each other, so conversation was impossible between people sitting at either end. This was the only downside though...but nothing to stop us from walking around to talk to those not within our ear shot!
Among us, our orders included Crisp green & honey tangerine salad, Signature chilli crab pasta, Fish & chips, Beef cottage pie, Honey berry ribs, Baked Norwegian salmon and Lamb shank. Verdict based on feedback:
-Lamb shank and the Signature chilli crab pasta came out tops!!
-Honey berry ribs = good but the portion could have been larger
-Baked Norwegian salmon was given a thumb down coz of ""both the fish itself and the sauce""

I had the chilli crab pasta and in my view, the chilli crab claw meat sauce could have been more spicy but overall, it was very delicious and I like the fried soft shell crab topping!

For drinks, noteworthy would be Trappist Beer (there is a chart describing each type - this was passed to us by the server when we asked her what's the difference between Orval and Westmalle). Kudos for her efficiency and very good attitude which is priceless:))

As usual, my review will always include mention of deserving staff and in this instance, I would like to single out the female bespectacled server who took our orders, served the dishes, cleared the table and took time to listen to special requests we made of certain dishes and helping us out of the Trappist Beer jargon trap!!"
Great spot for family in Singapore!,"Great service, very clean and comfortable. Food range was good as it covered both wof western, Asian and a fusion of both. Laksa was excellent and the chili crab pasta was nice. Truffled mayonnaise dip for the fries was great as well."
Delicious and cheap food,The menu was great with local & western selection . Price was cheap and delicious food . The service was awesome . Only disadvantage is the chairs & tables. The tables are too low for the chairs. Very uncomfortable while eating.
A quick dinner that was tasty and value for money,"We were in the city and it was almost dinner time. Famished, we looked for a quiet and average place to have dinner. It was humid and so an air-conditioned place was the plan. We found this cafe just beside the Catholic Church of Sts. Peter and Paul ( back part of the church). It was cosy and the food was good. My friends went for simpler meals like the wrap, mac and cheese, etc but I went for their signature dish which is the pork ribs with berry sauce and it was very nice. The meat just fell off the bones and I felt it was a nice twist to having sweet potato fries in place of the potato ones. I was happy to discover the cafe had the TripAdvisor seal posted on their door and it was an opportunity for me check the cafe out myself.

The ambience was alright and the staff were ok with the exception of one gentleman who was very attentive. Kudos to him. Sorry, I forget his name. He is a little large and wears black or dark rimmed glasses.

Service for the food can be quicker but I guess maybe because we were all so hungry it seemed that the food was taking forever to arrive.

On the while, yes, I am going back again."
Great food and cozy corner,I love the local delights and all day brunch items. All profits go to charity! Best of all worlds - you get to do your part for charity and enjoy good food at the same time!
Good food and pleasant experience.,Food was very good and on a quite street away from the main street. Menu is limited and were able to find something that we liked.
Good Food and Pleasant Staff,"It was my first time to Crossing Cafe with my Best Friend to support our Friend who is singing for the event organised by Memories Cafe.

We ordered Soft Shell Pasta and Prawn Quesadilla. The food was great. We were served by a friendly waitress, Ruiting.. She is polite and attentive."
Average afternoon tea,"Went for afternoon tea with my mum. I ordered an Oolong tea and sausage puff pastry, she got a latte and a cheesecake.

The sausage puff pastry had been reheated in the microwave and the sausage had no flavour at all – horrible. The tea was nice but nothing special, it's just a tea-bag.

The latte and cheesecake were quite nice though, it seems I just chose the wrong products!

My advice: steer clear of the savoury pastries (maybe they're okay when fresh but not in the afternoon), but go ahead if you're after some cheap and nice cake/coffee."
Good value lunch set,Food is true to local taste and decent portions. The set lunches are good value for money. Service is prompt. Parking is an issue around the area especially during lunch times but there are several hotels 50m to 100m walk away.
A great place to start your day...,"We had breakfast at Crossings on two occasions and thoroughly enjoyed the food and the coffee. Service was excellent and the staff were efficient and friendly.
The menu is quite limited, but the food was fresh and well cooked.
Our cappuccinos were excellent and this all got our day started properly.
Heartily recommend Crossings"
For a good cause and delighted with the food,"Had business lunch with a client who bought me to this restaurant.

She likes the idea of this restaurant which is a social enterprise.

While we enjoyed our lunch, the service doesn't lapse and the food was delightful.

I will urge you to support this restaurant for business to continue for a good cause.

Well done and all staff to keep up with their fantastic service!"
"Good food, friendly service, simple and quiet","A pleasant, quiet place that serves good food and drinks with good service for decent prices. Wine starts at $33 for a bottle of Chilean. Tried the berry pork ribs and they were very good. Came with excellent sweet potato fries. Bonus: Crossings is a social enterprise so it feels good eating here. They don't trade on that though, preferring to let their food and service do the talking."
Great concept and great food,"This is a great concept and does enhance the value of the meal. The food was exceptional with great service. a good restaurant, highly enjoyable and we will be back for more. keep up the good work."
Good food good values,"This is one of those ""must do"" places in Singapore. I like when my food dollars go further than just the meal I got.... Crossings is a social enterprise set up to assist and train people with employment barriers who might never get a fair go anywhere else.
They also make good tasty food and serve nice wine and drinks too,

I have tried their coffee and rank it VERY HIGH in the coffees I've had in Singapore.

Lunch is popular, but I have only had dinner.

A simple and concise menu was offered. Being the period of Lent, Fish and seafood were offered instead of the usual selection of meats and poultry.

Atlantic salmon with asparagus, Stirfried seafood and sea bass were tasted at our table and every one enjoyed.

By having dinner here you support an amasing training program, encourage others to strive and find their own independence. This is priceless."
Eating for a cause,They hire special needs adults to wait and serve at the cafe. The food is above average and they are currently serving a Lenten menu for the Lenten season. They also serves Trappist beer made at Trappist monastery.
"Tasty Food, Affordable Price albeit slow in serving",Went there twice cause of the surprisingly tasty food. Just that they took about 20 minutes to prepare despite no crowd was there at the time when I went. But I personally think it is worth the wait. Their salad and vegeterian sandwich tastes really good. I also like that all sales profits will go to charity :)
Evolving menu risks losing uniqueness,"Crossings Cafe is a social enterprise employing youths at risk with proceeds going to charity. When I first visited them twice last year, their menu was more local/ local fusion. Today, their menu has evolved towards western less local. Thus, more items like fish and chips, less items like Laksa and chili crab pasta. I liked it the way it was. Those local and local- western dishes made them comfortably appealing yet unique. I'm unsure the new direction is taking them to a good place. Still, I'd support it because it is a worthy cause and food is ok."
Great Food for a Great Cause,"Heard about this cafe and went down to try with my husband ! It was such a great experience that I brought my foodie kids down to try! The service is sincere and food is great! Prices are very reasonable! Try the Aglio Olio, chilli crab pasta; burgers and bread are great! Cappuccino and ice cream are fabulous!"
Cosy cafe,"I went there twice, once alone and the other time with a group. The first time alone the cafe did not have a table and I was told to wait. It was just a short wait and very pleasant too because the cafe interior is so cosy. I ordered the lunch specials both times and they were good. Portions might be smaller than expected but I was full each time.

Loved seeing how the supervisor was so patient with the service crew who are either youths at-risk or those with special needs.

Try the panna cotta!"
Good lunch for a good cause,Happened upon Crossings cafe for lunch whilst shopping in the area. It is a not for profit place which helps disadvantaged members of society. Food was good and there was plenty of choice. We had tandoori chicken sandwich and crab pasta. Recommended.
"Clean, friendly and yummy.","We happened upon this place by accident, it is very close to our hotel so very convenient. We arrived a little early for dinner but they accommodated us. Food was very good. We especially enjoyed having ice cream at the end of the meal. Best value ever. $2 a scoop."
Breakfast,"Ate here twice in a week. Food was worth the price. For breakfast, I had pancakes and dinner, I had pasta. Both were good.

Staff were attentive and service was great

All profits from this establishment are donated to charity and the staff are from the socially disadvantaged segment of society

Here you can have a good meal and do a good deed. What more can you ask for?"
Cafe provides jobs for disadvantaged youths and its profits go to charities,"The café is located on 55 Waterloo Street, on the ground floor of the Catholic Centre. Do note that Waterloo Street is one-way going towards Bras Basah Road, so if you’re driving, you’ll have to enter via Middle Road. Parallel parking lots are available along the stretch of road just after the turning. Alternatively, you can try parking at Hotel Royal Queens, which is on the parallel Queen Street. The hotel carpark is really narrow and hard to manoeuvre though. To reach the café, just head out the lobby and walk through the small lane just opposite the hotel; Crossings is at the end of the lane. But honestly I would just take the MRT instead. It’s a lot more convenient! The nearest MRT station would be Bras Basah (Yellow or Circle Line). Take Exit E and walk up along Waterloo Street; the café is diagonally opposite the Singapore Calligraphy Centre.

Crossings may seem like just any other café serving up Western (and some Asian) mains, but it is actually a social enterprise venture aimed at helping disadvantaged youths by providing them with internships and jobs at the café. Some reviewers noted that the prices are slightly steeper than elsewhere, but I feel the prices here are still quite competitive; mains here cost around S$14-18, while the desserts are all less than S$10. All profits from Crossings get channelled into other charities anyway, so I guess it wouldn’t really hurt to pay a little bit more?!

My family went down as a big group, so we took the opportunity to sample their different items. Food choices are a little limited, but while they lack in variety, they make up for it in terms of taste. I photographed a number of dishes we ordered just to let you readers have a feel of what is offered here at Crossings. I didn’t get to try all of them, so I’m only going to focus on the ones I sampled. Fish and Chips (S$14) was really good; the fish fillet was well-breaded and fried to crisp perfection on the outside while still soft and pillowy on the inside. Served with salad and a bed of fries, this dish is definitely more than enough for one. The Chicken and Aubergine Parmigiana (S$16) is another impressive dish; the serving is generous and they managed to lock in the moisture of the meat in the crisp batter remarkably well. I had the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich (S$15) which was delicious as well; the pulled pork was just so tender! The Prawn Aglio Olio (S$15) was another amazing dish that was flavourful. For the sides, I liked the Onion Rings (S$6) best, which taste a little like the ones served at Burger King, only larger. Their Fries (S$6) are quite good too. Taste-wise, they remind me a lot of the curly fries served at MacDonald’s during Chinese New Year. Most mains are usually accompanied by fries (be it potato or sweet potato), so you don’t really have to order any extra! The Chicken Wings (S$8) though, were too salty for my liking.

Desserts are also quite limited here. Cake of the Day (S$5) was a sea salt and caramel cake, which I liked for its light caramel flavour, but I couldn’t really pick out any saltiness to be honest. Panna Cotta of the Day (S$5) was a milk tea flavoured one, which was nice. It’s served in a cute dessert jar topped with Gula Melaka (this brown-coloured palm sugar syrup) and strawberries. The Panna Cotta tastes like the pudding-version of the milk tea you get from KOI or Gong Cha. I felt that the dessert could have reduced the amount, or even done away with the palm sugar syrup altogether because it made the Panna Cotta too sweet. My family liked the Profiteroles (S$7), but I thought they were just ok. I felt the ice cream lacked flavour which made the dessert taste flat overall. My favourite was the Molten Cake with Ice Cream (S$9). What’s interesting is that they offer the molten cake in flavours like white chocolate and hazelnut, apart from the usual chocolate. I wanted to try the white chocolate flavoured one but they ran out of it unfortunately, so I settled for hazelnut instead. It looks just like the original chocolate-flavoured one, but there’s a hint of hazelnut when you actually get round to sinking your teeth into this chocolate goodness. They’re really generous with the ice cream too! The dessert is quite rich so order to share.

Most of the staff here are quite friendly, and the service attentive. Even though we were a big group, the staff who served us took the effort to remember who ordered what and served the dishes accordingly. There were some individuals who were a lot more reserved, but their service was just as attentive. All in all, I think Crossings Café met a lot of my expectations, and I would recommend you readers to try it out! I for one would definitely return for their white chocolate molten cake!"
Come n try,All proceed from this cafe will be used for charity...the foods are also good. The beer so tasty. My fav is an ice cream with coffee on the bottom. Delicious.... come try n charity in one package..
Good cafe,We always see this cafe on our way to church and decided to try it one time. The ambience is relaxing and the staff service is good. We have tried their chicken wings and it was delicious. Plus factor for this cafe is that they help the disadvantaged youths. Will definitely go here again.
Cafe with a Cause!,"Found this Cafe tucked away from the bustle of Bugis area. Great Ambience and good selection if dishes. The soup we tried was okay but the sea bass was very tasty. We found it Just a tad bit overpriced. The cafe employs disadvantaged members of society, which is a brilliant initiative!"
More than a Meal,"The best thing about Crossings Cafe is that it isn't just good food. It's a restaurant that deliberately employs disadvantaged young people in order to give them a start. And all of its profits go into charity work. That is a real winning combination.

The food is good. The service is good. But the idea is WONDERFUL! If you are in downtown Singapore, avail yourself of something more than a meal. Make what you eat become a statement of compassion. You'll love the taste."
Cosy and affordable place for tea,"Was walking aimlessly around the vicinity of Bras Basah one afternoon with a friend when i was attracted by a colorfully painted wall in this restaurant. After checking out their menu, i realised that they actually offer rather affordable tea time sets- A croissant/muffin with coffee/tea for S$5 or a slice of cake with coffee/tea for S$7. On a weekday afternoon, the place is quiet and cosy, perfect for those who like being in quiet and undisturbed places to do some reading or a gentle conversation with some friends.

However, it can get pretty crowded at night, so be sure to make reservations before hand if you are planning to come in a big group.

At this cafe i tried:
-Ice coffee
-Chocolate muffin (which is very rich the way that i like)
-Oreo cheesecake
-tomato soup (Absolutely lovely)"
Cafe with a social purpose,"I was very impressed with the level of service and the quality of the food. The staff were attentive and I must have had my glass topped up at least 5 times with ice water. (It was a hot day!)The waiter who was intellectually challenged even asked if I wanted an extra plate when I told him I would be sharing my dessert .
Our main dishes of chilli crab pasta sambal cream fish were delicious! The chilli crab was served with 2 soft shell crabs that were crisp and not over oily. Definitely value for money as the servings were quite large.
My only disappointment was that the display board had iced mango soufflé as one of the desserts offered when it had already been taken off the menu. I would suggest that the management use a chalk board for their specials instead of writing with permanent ink.
I applaud the whole idea of gainful employment for those who are disabled."
Good ambience very cosy and good food,Highly recommend this place - i walked pass so many times and it always looks busy- finally give it a go today and tomorrow its worth it staff are nice and food is good what else do we ask for from a restaurant?
