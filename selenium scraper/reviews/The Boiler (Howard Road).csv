Excellent service,Food was fantastic! The service was excellent as well. We didn't have to wait long for food to be served. Overall fantastic experience!
Great Food and Service,"Lobster give away is great for birthdays, one must buy the BAG which costs SGD180+. Fair enough although you are somehwhat paying for the 'free' lobster. Wine had to be ordered by the bottle and not sold as glasses, having said that, the wine selection arent fantastic and the bottle we had to buy, wasnt good just drinkable for the not cheap bottle of red."
Forgettable,"For the price paid, we could have gotten much tastier seafood from our regular black pepper crab and chilli crab restaurants. The seafood here just tastes like boiled seafood with bottled sauce. The bombdiggity bag is supposedly meant for 4 persons, but if not for the free lobster (birthday promo) and extra 2 orders of mantou buns, it wouldn't have been enough for my family of 4. The ice lemon tea is almost tasteless - very diluted. They charge $3.90 for the refillable tea, but they don't refill unless you keep waving your arm to get their attention or walk over to them to ask."
Thank You for an Awesome Evening,We had a great birthday celebration at Howard Road Boiler on 4th Dec. Our first time at this branch and we love the ambience and superb service by the branch manager and her team. The sambal sauce for the seafood's bag was awesome!
Great atmosphere,It’s a good hidden neighbourhood place. Good to hangout with friends and family. Love the ambience and highball drink
Birthday at Boilers without birthday cake,"I went to Boiler at Howard Road for the very first time with my family. Many attempts we try to book a reservation on same day when we decided to dine out. Perhaps, I have the birthday luck that day to get a reservation. We are very excited and ordered a Boiler's Bombdiggity bag with a free lobster as a birthday compliment. The seafoods are very juicy fresh and the foods was served pretty fast. We also ordered several starters and salad to test it out. The crispy soft shell crab salad was very delicious. There is also the happy hour drinks deals that come great.
There are few tables celebrates birthday on that day and only disappointment was my table no birthday cake. Birthday cake with candle light was served only at selected table. I only get my one small slice of cake as take away when asked. I hope dinners can allowed to bring own birthday cake since not all birthday table can get the birthday cake."
Good experience,Came here for my mother's birthday. Had a splendid time. The staff was super friendly and the food was amazing.
Super fresh seafood and Free Lobster in your birthday month,Both the lobster and seafood bag were fresh and soo tasty. I really enjoyed the messiness of it all. Come with a group of friends and dig in!
Birthday celebration at The Boiler,I had a wonderful family birthday celebration at The Boiler. Staff attentive and friendly. Food is awesome.
Need to sort their ac then worth it,"More like broiler room - good venue, great music and wide selection but need to sort their ac as far too hot, so I bailed early ☹️"
Yummy,Portion was huge. Seafood was tasty. Be prepared to get your hands dirty! Not too busy on weekday nights
Garlic butter yum,"We enjoyed the food. 5 ladies, ordered 2 bags, with 2 free lobsters. Our favorite is the garlic butter sauce."
Customer service,We (with elderly) came 15mins earlier than our reservation time. There was another group of 30-40 years old came after us. The staff attended to them first. Very disappointed.
Good food,We ordered the seafood combo with crab and the in-house sauce is simply great! And the quantity is just right for 2!
Birthday Dinner at The Boiler@Howard,"Excellent service! Surprise birthday FREE Lobster for our friend plus a apron with BIRTHDAY markings and this made our day! In addition, the service staff even prepared another birthday cake for him! What more to ask for? Highly recomended !"
"Good service, Great food",3rd visit here n the food never disappoints. seafood bag is great! loved the fried oysters and the chicken wings is excellent (we ordered a second serving!)
Awesome food,Food is awesome and service is great even if the crew are few. The atmosphere and ambiance is good for us friends.
Service issue at Howard Road outlet,"Food was quite good. Great lunch offer on lobster. The new item, oyster was good but east it while it's still crispy ,it makes a lot of difference. Service not good. My wife and I came about 10 minutes before opening last Friday, so we stood outside the door. When they finally turned the 'closed' signage we were 'greeted' by a wait staff as if we were queuing for free food. No proper greeting, no good afternoon, no thank you for waiting, just a very very curt ""reservation?"" ....""Name?"" And pointed to us to a table. After which there was absolute nothing from her. She treated us as if I owed her a living. As if she's giving us a free meal and she was forced to pay for it. WTH!!!! Initially had the intention of bringing my kids for Sunday dinner there, but after that experience......never. To be fair, again, food was good. But that Chinese wait staff, she's utter rubbish!"
Great for the seafood lovers,Our 2nd visit for birthday celebration. Seafood bag was good but did feel the contents seem a little lesser and the price increased compared to last year. The blissful experience was completed with small bites chocolate cake and a slice of delightful mango cheese cake on the house.
Service was exceptional,"Food was not bad, the bombigiddity bag portion was enough for 4 person and certain drinks were refillable. The thing that stood out was the service by Moises :)"
Birthday failure,Celebrated my gf bday in the restaurant. Didn’t get any complementary bday cake even though stated in the booking. Saw other table had it. Soured my plans. What’s a birthday celebration without a cake.
First time experience,"Decided to try some new seafood place instead of the regular Chinese style seafood. Was not disappointed. Delicious fresh seafood, great service and nice casual atmosphere."
Excellent service,"We have been served by Linda. She is excellent at her work. Effective and Efficient, clearly a manager whom encourages her team to see through details of the customers needs. My office is diagonally across the restaurant and like to bring my friends, staff and customers to visit the restaurant once in awhile. Great to have the customer experience where you look forward to visiting the restaurant again. Keep up the good work."
Open restaurant serving Western cuisine.,"On the ground floor surrounded by industry. Open space with high ceilings. Orders made through an iPad devise. Plenty of seafood offerings, we chose a vegetarian salad, chicken karagge, and a small portion of baby’s back ribs. All tasted good and acceptable. Price is at the higher end for bistro style restaurant. Quite popular during lunch time, plenty of industrial buildings surrounding restaurant. Service was fair and friendly."
Not worth the effort and money.,"I had a reservation at 7.30pm and I arrived at 7.10pm. However the reservation was ""checked-in"" at 6.14pm by another guest because of the same name (don't the restaurant check for name AND phone number?).

My family and I were left standing at a corner waiting for their arrangement. Eventually gotten a seat but the whole celebration was already ruined. It was for Father's Day celebration.

Orders placed through the iPad (as usual), drinks were not served till two dishes were already on the table. No utensils (I guess I was expected to rip the pork ribs apart using hands). I had to again, request for gloves and handphone sleeve.

Experience aside, the taste and flavor of the food gotten worse. My last visit was just a month ago and this time, the garlic flavor was just too much for their signature sauce. I wouldn't have re-visited this restaurant if they had messed up the previous round. The butter garlic flavor was okay.

All in all, almost $500 spent here for this kind of service and food standards? Not forgetting we made our way from Jurong to Howard road, for this experience. Not worth it. Absolutely not.

Due to the inconsistency in the food served and their service level, I won't consider this restaurant at all. People make reservations to get a guaranteed seat at the specific time stated, not to go there and wait at the corner."
Happy birthdaying at The Boiler,"Excellent seafood and happy birthday lobster. Garlic sauce to die for. Good ribs too. Should serve French bread basket, rather than the “mantou”, better to mop up the sauce. And please offer free water. It’s wrong for restaurants to charge for water."
you won’t regret!,"it’s my second time back and again the seafood bag didn’t disappoint me. the prawns are nicely cooked with the mud crab, and the clams soaked into the mildly spicy sauce got me finger licking.
a good surprise is the fried oysters which is yummy good n a must try"
"Not bad, can give a chance to try",Only Bombdiggity Bag package able to enjoy the birthday benefit - free lobster. The waiters service are not bad and friendly.
Seafood at the Boiler,"Tried the place at Esplanade but we thought we will give the place at Howard Rd a try. The place is pretty ulu, mainly industrial buildings but once we are settled, the Mother's Day set was just about right for the 5 of us. We tried the garlic sauce but I could observe quite a few tables trying the chili crab sauce. The seafood is pretty fresh but the lobster is probably not my cup of tea. Worth another visit but I still think the Esplanade site has more ambience. Thanks!"
Look no further if you're craving some Louisiana boil,"Really tasty seafood and decent value. The only thing that stopped me from grading them an A+ was that they ran out of Dungeness crab when we visited, and tried to replace it with mud crab for the same price. No way was I gonna pay Dungeness crab money for plain old mud crab."
Worth it very worth it,"Nice simple ambience. Super service and staff. Very helpful. No qualms for addition plates or gloves! Food, one of the better places. My nephew and his wife (from UK) loved it. Our second time there. Will be going back for. Beer slightly costly! :)"
An expensive sea food place with unique taste and flavour,"Saw lot of online review so visited this place and tried their signature dish (bomdig ****)

Decor is average as compared to the price of the dish, my friends liked it, I found it over priced place

Not a good place for vegetarian (of course one will not go to sea food place to try. Vegetarian )

Birthday month promotion was good … a free lobster"
Taste and Environment,"The place is pretty Nice, Modern and Neat. Taste is pretty good, just thta I hope maybe you can lessen down the seafood boil works sauce garlic? So it wouldn’t taste too much of garlic and maybe the table mat can be put on only after the customers arrive due to hygiene purposes ? Might’ve gotten a little bit of stomache from it but it’s okay!"
A bit overpriced,"Easy to get a reservation and service was great. The bombdiggity bag was a bit too little for 4 to be honest. If you are not coming on your birthday month(when you get a free lobster), it is not worth getting that bag $179. Also, it was a bit too bland(garlic butter) the last time we went in Apr 22 compared to the past. I guess there is not enough seasoning/salt. The breaded oysters, fries, desserts were nice."
Service was Great!,Service was friendly and Lynn was especially helpful in arranging for a birthday cake for my friend. Would definitely return for special occasions.
Enjoyed sumptuous Lunch!,My family and I enjoyed the lunch treat for my birthday. The food was good. We selected the Duo Plus - it was awesome. Service was good and superb ambience.
Dinner Saturday,"Staff was welcoming and attentive, Menu was easy to navigate. food was served quickly. Overall a great dinner date!"
Great Tasting Seafood & Ribs,"Seafood was very fresh, and the sausages provided an interesting twist. We selected the mild version of the sauce, called “The Works”. Sauce tasted very good with the deep fried bun, though the sauce was a little on the salty side. Overall, still great tasting. We also ordered a slab of BBQ ribs which was tender and moist with meat falling off the bone."
A place to celebrate birthday!,Thank you Boiler for the fantastic Duo Plus and their complimentary birthday cake! Not to forget the outstanding service by ZY! He has a good sense of humour and make effort to connect with the customers. Thumbs up for this young man!
Nice....,"Not a large selection on the menu, but the seafood was fresh and yummy. The birthday promo lobster was good, Ambience was simple but staff were fast and attentive."
Birthday lunch,"Food is good, portion should be better though, the combo advertised for 4 should come with more sides. The deal of free lobster for birthday is nice."
Fresh seafood with location outside of town,Seafood tasted good for the dish I ordered. Location was also good for a work or friends' gathering outside of central Singapore.
Excellent food in good dining environment,Dined many times at The Boiler Howard Road. And this time on the day of my birthday Thank you Cita for the extra effort. Big thank you to everyone at The Boiler.
Birthday dinner,"I visited there on my birthday, the staff were really friendly ~ the food was amazing ♡ the garlic butter sauce !"
worst restaurant ever,"Never ever buy their vouchers! i merely forgotten to use the vouchers that i bought and its expired by just a few says but they refused to extend it by even just one day. Its covid still and i overlooked it but the people managing the restaurant just have zero empathy! Why would anyone want to dine in such a restaurant. When u push the sale of vouchers u guys were so enthusiastic but when asked to extend expiry cos due to special circumstances cos of covid, u guys suddenly turned nasty and jusy flatly rejected me!"
"Fresh Seafood, Okay Service","Seafood was fresh and tasty. I would go back just for the food.
Service could have been better. One person stood out from the rest - he may have been the manager. He patiently explained how to navigate the ordering system and our questions about the food, and made a few recommendations. Other than that, we had to call out to the staff for service on multiple occasions during our meal."
Great food,Food is great! Price is gonna be pricey but normal especially for things like lobster. They still have the birthday lobster deal and that's brilliant.
Excellent and Friendly Service,"Friendly and Helpful Service Staff, assisting us in making the required order and providing drinks refill several time. Food is as good as review"
Delightful Evening,"Came to celebrate my dad and husband’s b’days with (only) one seafood bag. The service staff (the Eurasian / Caucasian lady who can speak Mandarin and young girl) were exceptionally attentive and thoughtful towards us, especially towards my parents. Then, overhearing my mum commenting that we only had one cake (so embarrassing), they initiated blessing us with another one — a very lovely surprise. All in all, we are very delighted with the food quality and owing to the sincere, and friendly service staff, our dinner was an extremely enjoyable one. Am very grateful and appreciative ❣️"
Nice birthday lunch,"Went to The Boiler to celebrate my eldest daughter's birthday. She loves seafood and the seafood here is really fresh and yummy. As it was in the month of her birthday, we managed to get the free Boston lobster in order to make the meal very worth the cost."
First visit to boiler,Recommended by a friend. Visited on a Fri for lunch. Place was empty and was a bit skeptical. But after trying the food will return. The Seafood bucket was good! Haddock fish and chips very well done as well.
"Good food, rustic location, happening vibes!",Introduced a friend to this place - he loved the food and the prices. Will not be the last time you will see him as he said his wife will enjoy the food too!
Great service,The service was very friendly and very attentive. Food was good. A little on the expensive side but will come back again.
"Great food, great service","Service was prompt and friendly from the very start and when my partner knocked his drink over, the staff literally ran over in 2 seconds to make sure any spillage was minimal! Service was very attentive but never overbearing - my partner's cup was always refilled. Cant say more about the food - fresh, generous, and delicious."
Nice food nice service nice environment,staff is very nice in their service. she recommend the food 1st time eat garlic butter seafoods with crabs is very nice taste and the restaurant environment is nice . will come back again
Good food and ambience,"This is a great place for those who love seafood and the novelty of eating off a bag is still there. Over the years, many have come and go but this place remains. Tells a lot about the quality of food and service."
Poor service staff,"Service was absolutely poor. We booked via chope for 6pm slot and made two bookings due to the limitation on no. of pax per booking (5pax) as we had 6+1pax. When we got there, the staff rolled her eyes at us multiple times claiming there’s only one booking of 2+1pax. Despite asking her politely if she needs the email confirmations we received from chope for our 2 bookings, she insisted there’s only one (rolling her eyes again). Not sure what warrants that multiple eye roll when we are speaking politely but please look up to bridge the gap between chope & the restaurant since they couldn’t locate the other booking."
Limited choices that's a little costly for the quality,"The combinations of the combos are generally similar. The seafoods are all quite fresh with most combos consist of a crab, some prawns, sliced sausages, clams, mussels and corns in the mix. My family's experience was mixed but all agreed that the Dungeness Crab and Prawns were good and well cooked however the supporting sides in the bag like the sliced sausages was we felt were average, some of the clams are not thoroughly clean and still have sands in them, corns were nice but there are too little pieces. I gave the score to the sauces, the house special 'Work' sauce and the garlic sauce were were quite good, we spent about $550 in all and we think its a little pricy for the quality. Hope Boiler improves on their menu and we will definitely be back for more crabs!"
Lunch with seafood set,"For that price point, seafood should at least be fresh. That wasn’t the case. Difficult to get servers attention, everyone was occupied with themselves behind the bar counter. Dessert was forgotten until I asked about it when I was paying at the counter so I could only takeaway. I had even indicated that it’s a birthday celebration and for them to put a candle on the dessert! Atmosphere was solemn since everyone was clearly solemn and dull."
Always favourite,"Tried for lunch, and it was always brilliant. Every time a favourite. Didn't do normal bag of seafood but did some salad and crab cakes. Another new favourite."
Average experience,The wild sauce is ordinary but the ingredient is fresh. Would not come back again because it was average.
Too rush,"Was told that for weekends, there is a 90 time limit to dine. Felt very stressful and couldnt get to enjoy what we wanted there as worried ordered and insufficient time to eat. Deep fried oysters taste better than the Esplanade branch but the bags were drier than the Esplanade branch- unable to soak the mantou. The ondeh ondeh cake was delicious. Overall, service was pleasant but was surprised to see the manager using her bare hands to remove our dirty utensils and equipment. Didn’t see the staff spray to sanitizer the ordering pad. Overall hygiene standard not there."
Nice!,"Food is fresh and tasty. Selections of drinks are not a lot, but is still sufficient. The service is alright. The staff just need to be a little friendlier."
Fresh seafood,"we like the dungeness crab in a bag but will order medium spicy and omit garlic the next time. The seafood is fresh, big and value for money. Service is very good with unlimited flow of homemade iced lemon tea."
Deliciousness,This is my second time at The Boiler. Brought me mom there for the first time and she loved the it! There were selections for those who didn't want to eat the bags too!
Nice ambience,Nice place for couples. A different seafood dinner experience. It's expensive though. Ample parking lots in the industrial buildings.
Super Expensive for So So Food,"We went for our son's birthday and ordered the BomDiggity bag and he got a lobster free. His lobster tasted like mud. We might be spoiled by lobster in the US, but this did not taste like a fresh Boston lobster. The flavour of all the seafood was similar: tasted frozen, not fresh. For the price, it was quite disappointing. Also the sauce was too overpowering; perhaps to try to cover the taste of the seafood. We did really enjoy the crab cakes and the onion rings. Service was good and the atmosphere was relaxing. But for the price and the seafood, we will not return here."
Always favourite,"We have been frequently and Boiler is our favourite. Love it! It is a definite restaurant to book, any day of the week it's always busy. Make sure to book and enjoy one of our favourites!"
Fantastic place for seafood and drinks,The crab here was at par if not better in some aspects to the a lot of bigger places. Amazing food and very nicely dressed deserts. A very open floor plan leads to a very well serviced. This was everything I would have asked for from a Monday family lunch.
Family Dinner,Staff was very friendly and patient to guide us through the ordering process including recommendation on the sauce to use
Very good service and food,Very happy with the food and service there. Celebrated 3 x birthday there. Will continue going there. Thank you so much.
Food is very nice,The seafood was very fresh and the chef cook the food just nice. Well done! Keep it up. Thank you very much.
"Great food, service and facilities - Would come again","Fantastic service from Sharon and “The Boiler” team. The food came quickly and was fresh and delicious. Unique “food in a bag” dining experience. The place has a nice ambience and is family friendly.

Would highly recommend and come back.
Keep up the great work team!"
Great Seafood option,"Was pleasantly surprised by the menu, the portion size (we had the Duo) and the relaxed ambiance. Would like to see a stronger wine list (and a cider option) but beer on tap was fresh and well priced."
Great seafood,"Nice concept - food being served on the table in bags, without plates, works just fine for this kind of food. Delicious seafood, good service. Atmosphere could be a bit warmer - Luisiana style."
Not impressed with taste and flavor,"nice and quiet ambience; huge portions; friendly and excellent service; however, not impressed with flavor of seafood; prawns, crabs and lobster tasted blend with little 'sweetness'"
"Expanded venue, food standard drop, service super slow","I am disappointed in my latest visit to the outlet. Just been there in September (a month ago). I guess they just got the separate venue 2 doors down and the logistic is not working out properly. The seafood bag was diluted, not much sauce can be seen/tasted. Quantity of the items seems to be reduced. Clearly, there is also short of manpower. We wanted to order more as the food was not satisfying and couldn't get the waitress attention. had to wait quite long for the bill as well. I hope they will improve as this has been one of our top-choice."
Happy Tummy!,Food is superb! Fresh seafood! There are are so many choices from their menu. We will definitely be back. Almost the same back in US!
Good service and good food,Food was amazing and i would totally revisit. service was also fast and inefficient. Table was already set up for us before we got there. Food came in less than 10mins
Must Try,"Visited The Boiler in Nov with Birthday Lobster, Ordered Bombdiggity Beg (The Works flavour) and garlic butter for Lobster, it taste really good for “The Work” and so strong that we wouldn’t really taste the garlic butter, overall the taste is good and make you feel like going back.

TheBombdiggity was a little bit expensive to me, I won’t order without any free lobster,

The service was good, the staffs were helpful and non stop refilling our ice lemon tea, it was a surprise to me when they give a free slice of cake with candle. Appreciate the small but meaningful act.

I visited the Howard branch, atmosphere were good(Tables are far to each other due to COVID), air con was cold enough to have medium hot “The work” flavour.

Overall - Must try once if you have not yet done so."
Nice ambience and wonderful food,Was there to celebrate mum’s birthday. 1st visit to the place. Well hidden from the busy street. Interesting setup.
OK food but bad service,"Reservation for 8pm, but could only be seated at 8.15pm. Many alcoholic drinks were sold out. We ordered the Premium Set, which included items like coleslaw and crab cakes, but no plates and cutlery were given. Neither were we given the tools for cracking crab. We had to ask 3 different waiters before finally getting them. The 2nd waiter even told us that the style of the restaurant meant that we were supposed to eat food from the tabletop and with hands. Are we supposed to eat coleslaw with our hands? Furthermore, this was not the 1st time we were there. The previous visit, we were given plates and cutlery without asking.
Food wise, tasty but felt that it was overly salty, especially the fried chicken wings. I was really thirsty after the meal. They forgot the mandatory lobster in our premium set. Our waiter noticed this, but we had to remind him and wait ages before it was served. Also, no free water was served. Most of the times, some of the waiters were just standing around not doing anything.

The premium set + free birthday lobster was too much for 4 pax. . Had to dabao most of the sides. Saving grace was the desserts, which included a free mango cheesecake because of birthday.

Expect your clothes and hair to be really smelly coming out of the restaurant.

A very messy experience. Would not be going back."
Always favourite,"We have spent so times in Boiler and always take there for friends. It's a favourite. We always our place for birthdays. Only issue is that it's full everyday, and we have to make a reservation, which is great for them. The boiled bag is brilliant, and the kids like the fish and chips, but always get stuck into the bag as well. Such a beautiful meal."
Good food,"The food was very delicious, value for money. We enjoyed the meal very much! Would definitely go back again"
Brilliant Food and Ambience,Food was really good! Ambience was nice as well. My friend and I really liked the food. Will be back again!
Joyful family lunch,We booked for a lunch for our family for our Birthdays and Wedding Anniversary which their promo offer $75 off with promo code and a free lobster. Our family enjoyed the lunch and all the staffs there are very friendly and helpful.
Fresh and perfectly cooked seafood,"The seafood here is perfectly cooked, it taste fresh and succulent. We have order 2 sauces, the garlic butter was good with nice garlic flavour. The other we have the mild spicy sauce, not like the normal chilli crab type of sauce but it taste ok, was expecting a richer sauce. Good services from friendly and polite staff."
Great place and service,"Everything in the bag was excellent. freshness of the crabs and prawn were great too. However as we claim the free lobster due to the birthday month, we find the lobster meat to be too chewy and harder to peel off."
Nice food,"Nice food, but the service must be improved. I love the chilli crab, it is very special. Next time i will back again, but i hope the service must be good, thanks"
Really Fresh seafood,"A fun idea with good friends, probably not the safest thing to add during Covid. Fresh seafood, clams, mussels, shrimp, crabs comes in a bag and shared by all 4 of us. Great sauce which I ended up asking to take come! Finished with a couple of orders of fish and chips and a round of beers. Fun evening."
Birthday treat,Delicious and fresh seafood. Received a big lobster free as birthday treat. Safe distancing was practised
Everything was great BUT,we unfortunately were served by an unpleasant waiter with a very unfriendly attitude who answered our questions quite rudely. A total buzzkill on a night for celebration. Food 5/5 Service 4/5 Atmosphere 3/5
Super worth it,The service was top notch. Responsive and polite services was provided. Food arrived shortly after ordering.
Boilers review,"In-attentive waiter. Food sauce spill on the floor, still keep walking till we highlighted to him. No thank you or a word."
Will be back soon,"It was our 2nd time here and our last visit was 4yrs ago. Booked our table using Chope like the last time. Could hardly remember how/what the food was like and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity of food. We ordered the $89 seafood bag. The seafood was fresh and nicely flavoured! Would have rated 5 stars for the food if not for the soft shell crab salad that we ordered. The veggies were practically swimming in the dressing and there was too much peanut topping Salad quantity is good for sharing among 4 people, do not recommend for 2 pax to order it. All in all we had a wonderful meal!"
Excellent sea food.,"Excellent food. It was first time for us visiting this place. The sea food is fresh and served promptly. Must try.

Service initially was a bit slow. Difficult to get attention. Though they have a tablet to order the food, on each table, since it was our first time here, we needed some clarifications. But again they could possibly be short staffed due to current situation. Having said that a lady by name Linda made sure we were served well and ensured that the service standard improved significantly."
Poor Service,Have informed on booking to pre-order cake for birthday surprise but it was not prepared even though it was double confirmed on the day itself before reaching the restaurant. Have selected birthday redemption of lobster on the booking but was not informed only certain items have the redemption until i asked the staff. Apparently they DO NOT see your booking details. Disappointed experience.
Best birthday!,"Food is soo delicious! Had the duo bag (The Works sauce is amazing and wonderfully spicy) with cajun fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, cajun chicken. The fried oysters were also a big hit. Ordered delivery for a birthday and they went above and beyond with the cutest birthday aprons, a delicious chocolate fudge cake and a handwritten card. Delivery was right on time, effortless and incredibly friendly. Will absolutely order here again. Special thanks to the manager Linda who has been nothing but great."
Great place and great food! Excellent customer service especially Amos,Good for big group so can get to enjoy different varieties. Well recommended and die die must try!! We will be back
Great food and service!,Best offer under TGIW. Need reservation in advance. Went for the basic package of seafood and too good to get one more prawn bag. Service was awesome from Amos and seriously worth the visit!
