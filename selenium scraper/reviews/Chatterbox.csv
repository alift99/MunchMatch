Lunch with friends,The service and ambient was as expected. The chicken rice overall did not taste as good as it was years ago. The chicken itself lacked the aromatic fragrance and the rice lacked the fullness of the chicken stock flavour.
Great dinner,"Brilliant place, perfect settings and excellent service. We could not have asked for better food with a superb quality/price. Strongly recommended and we will be back for more"
Good local cuisine,"Wonderful experience, good representation of local cuisine in a classy setting. It is on the pricey side but worth it if you are catching up with friends and good place to hang around for drinks after the meal. Ordered chicken rice, satay, hot pan tofu and chendol dessert. Food was great!"
Not as good as 10 year ago,"I visited chatterbox 10 years ago when they were in Mandarin hotel. The chicken rice was excellent. When they open offshore shop in HK, I tried once and not as satisfactory as expected. The chicken was cold and tough. This time I purposefully visited the Singapore shop to see if there was different from that of HK. The taste is like that of HK and I feel disappointed."
dinner,"ate the sambal kang kong, assam barramundi and tau suan. food quality is ok. service can be automatic. need to ask twice for water refill. dont know why the 'rush' to clear the plates when the ice water refill is more important."
Delicious!!!,Best Hainan chicken rice ever! Also loved the satays and tofu dish... highly recommend this as THE go to place for Hainan chicken rice and other local delights!
Delicious Food,"We love the food at Chatterbox! From chicken rice, laksa, kueh pie and other dishes we have tried....all with perfect flavours!We had an amazing experience with the staff as well and the service was really good."
Family dinner,It was a pleasant experience with you. We want to visit again for chicken rice here. Distinguished themselves from the ordinary chicken rice around Singapore.
Christmas Lunch at Chatterbox,"We had booked for this lunch on Christmas Day on 7th October 2022. Having done so, we did not expect the poor frontline treatment we received when we arrived. We were told to go out and return later although the person at the desk that was receiving the guests was seating others that came after us. We were really annoyed with her bad attitude and long face. She was very very unwelcoming. She finally seated us with reluctance. We do not think she has given a good impression of Chatterbox restaurant that has been our family's favourite 'to go restaurant' since 1970s when it was on the ground floor of Mandarin Hotel. We hope this will change in the front line of hospitality service.
However I must comment that the service staff that served us once seated showed par excellence. My children and grandchildren (3 generations dining there) from London and Australia were so happy with the memorable cuisine. We will always come back again, but the first face we see MUST BE CHANGED to a more gracious person at the front. It can make a great difference. Hence I have given five stars to the restaurant although the one person in the front line spoilt it all for the restaurant and gave a very very bad impression."
Excellent Service,"The interior and food are excellent. We left our belongings in the restaurant and the next day we came back, the staff kept it and able to return it back to us. Thumbs up for the staff and great service."
Exemplary Service,"My dinner companion was fortunate to get a table this time round after having tried and failing to get one a few weeks before.

The look and configuration of the restaurant has been totally transformed after the rebranding, and it was a nice surprise. We were shown to a table in a cosy corner. The service rendered by the team member up to this point was exceptional.

I had in my mind to order one dish, the famous Chicken Rice. There was a set menu with it as one of the choice dishes, so both of us chose that. The wait staff managed to cross sell a bottle of house non-alcoholic beverage to go along with our orders. The meal was as expected, the chicken was soft and tender and the rice fragrant. The set meal came complete with ice-cream served in a coconut. The service remained consistently good throughout our dinner, very attentive without being intrusive.

Some might say the restaurant is overpriced but it definitely was an experience."
Rice not cook,Rice not cook properly. Curry chicken meat was still raw. Not thaw properly. Rather disappointing. Had high expectations
Super good experience,"I really enjoyed my dinner at Chatterbox. The ambience was very good, food was excellent & service super good & prompt."
Lobster Laksa is fabulous,You must make a reservation to eat here. At lunch time is very full. It is impossible to come without reservation. Fried kwetiaw or lobster laksa is my favorite choice.
Food is decent,Good location to host overseas business client. They were exposed to local delight in a good setting and environment.
An overdue visit.,"Must have been a decade since I last dine at the Chatterbox, visited with old friends from HK, atmosphere and service was good but other than that, was very poor value for money, the most famous dish - the chicken rice - was rather average, being local, I can find chicken rice a whole lot better than at Chatterbox at a fraction their price, disappointing."
Nice experience,"My family had chicken rice, rojak, fish head curry, laksa, cendol and coconut ice cream. All the dishes were nice, the chicken rice is not too oily. I would prefer to have a chicken egg instead of quail egg in the laksa."
Wonderful Classic Singaporean Dishes,"While you can certainly get chicken rice or char kway teow at the local hawker centre, there is a sense of rediscovery when eating these classic dishes at the Chatterbox. We ordered the chicken rice (which was nice but not extraordinary really). Much more impressive was the char kway teow and sambal stingray. There is also a good selection of craft beers and other beverages. More importantly, the service was very friendly and personable."
Good Old Friends playing Tai Tai Day,"Our first time back at the Chatterbox after its renovation. Quality of food is still good but menu choice seemed limited. Love my seafood Bee Hoon with abalone & scallop,"
Great Food!,We enjoyed the food and the place was great! It was a bit difficult to find the restaurant but was worth the little delay. Will go back when there is an opportunity.
Chatterbox,"Difficult to reach out to them via phone and no reply when we drop them a msg, thus causing so much inconvenience to diners."
Extremely bad service,"Although the decor was changed and the restaurant had tried to modernize their look the service standard was appalling and that cast a pall over the whole dining experience. From waiting to be seated to taking orders the staff was extremely inefficient and unprofessional. We had a party of 8 and ordered the famous chicken rice and when asked what cut we had said drumstick. To our surprise we were told the restaurant had to ration the drumstick and could only give us 3 plates of drum. Being a frequent patron in the past I was shocked. This had never happened. And for a restaurant which boasted its chicken rice, it was really shocking to be told this. We asked when this policy occurred. The waiter could not answer. The manager June came. She was frightfully unprofessional and just said no we have to keep for others. We asked what if the rest of the diners wanted breast meat. She did not reply and worst she walked off. We did not know whether we were getting our 6 drumstick cut. No one enlightened us. Then we were totally ignored and no service was rendered. We did not get refill of water. We had no inkling what happened to the chicken rice order. We waited. Then half hour later we received 5 drumstick and 1 breast meat. But it was appalling that the waiter and the manager June did not come back to us and ignored us rest of the night. We also had a birthday cake. Asked for a knife and lighter. Waited. Finally my little girl of 8 went to one of the wait staff. It was shocking the staff gave her the knife! That was really dangerous. The waiter did not even say please sit and I will bring the knife to the adults. Shocking experience. Very unprofessional. Bad service."
"Complacency is not a good look, Chatterbox","Poor service and experience. Good food doesn't make up for the distress you cause, Chatterbox.

THE INACCURATE MENU
Chatterbox, it doesn't take much to make a huge impact on customer experience where your menus are concerned. Let your customers know what's not available. This is a very basic aspect for restaurants.

Put a note in your menu that the Set Menus are not available on weekends. And also that your ""half chicken"" and ""full chicken"" selections are not available until 2023.

There is nothing more disappointing than spending time poring over the menu to select what you want, to be told it is not available, and until 2023!

THE LACKLUSTRE SERVICE
We were shocked by the service. Before the renovation, Chatterbox service was never this bad.

First, service was very patchy. while there were many servers around, it took a while to get their attention. We sat at our table for a while without a menu or a QR code to scan for the menu. This was at 2:20pm, mind you.

Second, servers didn't seem to know what to do with the food they are serving. They came with chicken rice trays and didn't know how to place it on the table without our help to shift the cutlery around.

Third, and the MOST ANNOYING, a server refused to add an adjoining table to ours despite our table being too small for the amount of food we ordered. She claimed there were other customers later who needed the bigger table, which was not true as the group that came was a group of two. Sigh. How do you expect us to eat like that with plates half hovering over the floor? So rude. It was almost as though the restaurant/ server was punishing us for ordering too much. What is the message you want to send, Chatterbox? Don't you want to increase spend per head?

COMPLACENCY
For that, Chatterbox, an industry veteran, one-star is in excess for you. You're resting on your laurels and have become complacent.

Shame on you for the disservice you're doing to Singapore's F&B and hospitality industry."
Chatterbox chicken rice,"The chicken rice is still as good as before and price has reduced, from the peak of more than $30 previously."
Excellent to visit next time,"Your foods are all delicious and valuable time to invite my friends and my family to visit and eat next time. Thank you for doing this restaurant. but a little concern about the reception told us have table reservation on 11.30 a.m. but we didn't come, so your reception sold table to other customers but My boss and team are all done clear even though my booking shown 13.30 pm. It's ok. Overall is perfect. :)"
Chatterbox Restaurant,It was our 2nd visit after the Revamp. Food and service were great. Air con was a little chilly but ok
Birthday lunch with spouse,"It has always been like a tradition to have birthday lunch with my spouse, as we are a big fan of this chicken rice. We even got a surprise birthday cake, complimentary from the restaurant. It was such a great moment for us!"
"Quality ok, quantity inadequate, value poor, ambience nice, service good.","We came here simply because we hadn’t been here in a while (since Hilton took over). The cafe looks clean and cozy. We ordered their signature chicken rice, seafood horfun and signature coconut ice cream.

Let’s talk about their signature chicken rice first. Firstly, the portions of everything are too small. For $25, surely they can be more generous…after the meal I ate a large dumpling at home to “fill up”. Secondly, the quality - i didn’t like the rice used; they were the small broken rice type that we usually use to make porridge. The chicken was good and tasty - didn’t think it was anything too extraordinary; and so was the soup. But the ginger and chilli were, again, in miserly portions. The chilli wasn’t hot at all, by the way. All in all, will I eat this “signature chicken rice” again? Never.

My mum had the seafood horfun and she enjoyed it. It was not their signature item, though.

Now the signature coconut ice cream. We think putting walnuts in was a mistake - walnuts typically carry a tinge of bitterness and it didn’t go well with coconut, at all, unfortunately. Instead, we would have suggested jackfruit, though I know that some Westerners may not like it (i mean, too bad right?!). The ice cream was alright, homemade it seems, but frankly nothing too outstanding. I would have put peanut crumbles inside - yummy, just the thought of it.

Service was quite good.

The above came up to almost $100 for two of us. I accept that since this is central Orchard, prices should be high to reflect the location. But given this kind of standard, and quantity of their “signature chicken rice”, it reeks of poor value and hence we are not likely to return. But I also get it - for the visitor who only stays one night in Singapore in this hotel, oh well, just pay and enjoy. (Maybe order some room service for supper later)"
Good food!,The chicken rice was pretty good as the chicken was really tender and overall the presentation looks really nice .
Great ambience!,My third time back but first after a hiatus of many years including the pandemic period. Standard has dropped slightly as the rice lacks fragrance.
Fancy Chicken Rice,"Dined here with colleagues specifically so we could experience the classic SG dish. The steamer chicken was super tender, and the accompanying broth, rice, and sauces made it interesting. I didn’t love it, but it was yum."
Best chicken rice in Singapore,Have enjoyed coming to Chatterbox for over 20 years. Easily the tastiest chicken rice in Singapore!!
Better than before…,"Food tasted better than before especially the chicken rice. Seems like there were more variety as well. The only downside was the air-conditioning was too cold and my food turned cold very quickly… other than that, will definitely return 😊"
Very good,We had chicken rice and satays. Food was very good and service was also very good. We will definitely return again.
Inattentive waiter,The waiter was inattentive to our call for service despite being one table away. I told my companion that the waiter ignores it because it is not under his purview except to set the table for the next guest.
Generally good,"Generally good food and service, although a small minority of the staff seemed rude. Presentation of the food is excellent."
Good chicken poor rice,"Chatterbox brings back fond memories as my mum used to bring me there for very special occasions. Hence, for her 68th birthday, I brought her to Chatterbox to reminisce the good times. It was post lunch hours and service was considered acceptable. We had opted for normal water. Kishore was serving us that day. It was raining quite heavily and weather was cold. Sadly, he didn't offer us any choice of warm or cold water. Hence, we were served icy cold water which we didn't make a fuss of. But, we had to catch his attention for more water even when the restaurant was only abt 70% full.
The star of the day arrived, the legendary chicken rice. The chicken was unmistakably good but the rice was lacklustre. While it was so fragrant, the rice grains used was a mix of thai fragrant rice and broken rice. Coming from a respectable restaurant, we would have expected nothing but full grain rice. $25 for broken rice does sound quite absurd to me.
We had chosen the set lunch that day that cost us $45 per pax.
Would we return again? Well, for the chicken, yes. But the rice, no."
No 1 Chicken Rice in Singapore...,"The Most Elegant Chicken Rice i ever had in Singapore. The Chicken is very fresh indeed, besides the fragant rice that enhance the appetite, as per se. The soy sauce and thick soy sauce along with the Garlic Chili Sauce paired in just nice. Soup was very good as the Cabbage enhanced the umami of the soup to the next level.

Im so proud that June being the Manager could handle the crowd so well be it am or pm, as per se."
A great family dinner celebrating my Birthday!,"We really love the renovated Chatterbox. The Color is so soothing n pretty. Service was excellent. Chicken rice portion seems to be smaller now. Overall, we really have a great time enjoying the local flavours n chatting the night away. Thank you the Serving staff for taking good care of us. A great shout out to Karen, June, Leslie n a lady service staff that attend to us. Good job!! Thank you again for making my birthday a memorable one."
Nice Ambiance,"The restaurant was nicely renovated and we were given a cosy corner. I was satisfied with the service, atmosphere and the taste but they could improve on the portion serving of the chicken rice. The rice was served in a small bowl, meant for kids.

When I asked the service staff why the portions are much smaller than in my previous visits, she said some customers complained that the sizing was too much and thus, they reduce the portion!

Customers flock to chatterbox for their signature chicken rice dish and who would ever complain on a larger portion?"
Disappointed,"Overrated, overpriced food and service. We ordered 2 appetisers : rojak and salted egg chicken wings, 2 mains : lobster laksa and chicken rice. Mains came way before appetisers. By the time we finish our appetisers, the mains were cold. Basic sequence of serving meal was totally non-existent.
Lobster laksa was nice but was soggy and cold by the time we ate it, nothing more special than what I can get for $6 in famous local spots.
Chicken rice, it was good but also nothing special. Boon tong kee is much nicer and way cheaper.
Rojak, I can get the same one outside at most hawker stalls for $3.
Salted egg chicken wings, there’s barely anything to bite on as the wings are just skin and bones with barely any meat.
All in all, will never come back again."
The chicken rice is nice but the tomatoes & cucumbers they gave very little.,They should also put chinese parsley and spring onion.which original is given like we ear last times. Same as the oysters egg omelette.
Just get the chicken and rice,The chicken and rice dish is what this place is known for. The rice was full of flavor with the chicken as soft and juicy as they come. The other dishes were meh…
Feedback,Prices are on the high side. A normal (small) portion fried Hokkien mee seafood costs $25. The rojak at at $15 was overly sweet and rather runny. The sweets platter of 6 mini kueh was unimpressive.
Best Chicken Rice in Singapore,"My husband and I had dinner at Chatterbox. We were seated at a spacious table in the glassed-in verandah. I ordered the Individual Set of chicken rice and it was delicious. The soup was tasty, the rice moist and the steamed chicken succulent. My husband had the Curry Chicken with rice which he said was very good. We ordered a side of chicken satay that melted in our mouths. We had dinner here many years ago and it has improved so much. The location at Hilton Hotel is great and the corridors, woodwork and decor added to the warm ambience. The staff were pleasant, prompt and alert. We will be back again!"
Chicken Rice is my favourite,"Chatterbox has been famous for its chicken rice for a long time. Thanks to unlocking the city. After more than 2 years, I have the chance to come back to Chatterbox again to enjoy the chicken rice meal. The restaurant has been fully renovated with a nice comfortable environment. The standard of the chicken rice is excellent as before. I would love to revisit again and again to enjoy this great recipe. The only disappointment is that the restaurant does not seem to sell its dark sauce and chili sauce now."
Food are good but not excellent.. service can be better,I went there the first time one month ago about 3pm . The lady at reception not really friendly . When I wanna book the Another for dinner again she wasn’t really helpful . She ask u to check and book online yourself . Chicken rice are good but u can have even better one in food hall . The one I love was the coconut ice cream ! It was really good !
"Not worth, exxpensive and bad dishes","Terrrible Not worth, exxpensive and bad dishes. Never come back again. The food is cold and staff are"
Lovely dinner,Great food and amazing place to share with overseas friend who had never try any local cuisine. Lovely service from the crew. Love the cozy ambient. Definitely will go back again and recommend to friends
Very good Lunch,"Ordered the Mandarin Chicken rice, Signature coconut ice cream and coconut shake. The foods and drink tasted very good. The order of the Chicken Rice came with chilli sauce, soya sauce, ginger puree and soup on a tray. The chicken was juicy, rice is good. The decor and ambience of the place is nice."
Excellent chicken rice,The chicken rice rice here lives up to its reputation. We also ordered the lobster laksa and char kwei tiau which were quite good. The laksa could have a bit more lobster in it for the price.
Service,"The food is great but service manager who assign us to table is not so great and is a bit rude. My father inlaws was old and he has difficulty standing, as we came early about 10 minutes before restaurant was open and the waiting seats are all occupied, my father inlaws decided to sit alone in the restaurant (near restaurant entrance) and there was another young lady who was sitting as well on another table as well. One lady manager suddenly appeared and seemed unhappy and scolded him for sitting there, and we explained that he is old and could not stand too long. it ruined everyone's experience as no tolerance towards elderly and one person was sitting while the rest waiting and standing outside"
Happy with hotel offerings,"Tasty food and excellent service. If you are looking at celebrating any special occasion, I will strongly recommend Chatterbox. For those who is looking for a budget affair, this will not be the place for you."
Best Chicken Rice in Singapore,We saw reviews claiming that Chatterbox was the place to get the best chicken rice in Singapore. And it is indeed. Great taste and chicken melting in your mouth. The service is brilliant and the restaurant very chic.
Good food and service,"Chicken Rice was good, Singapore style hokkien mee was good too. Staff was great, professional and friendly. All around great experience and will return for sure."
Disappointing,"Stayed at the (new) Hilton on Orchard Road this weekend. My better half and I tried Chatterbox for the first time …mainly because of its reputation, particularly for its Chicken Rice.

We were underwhelmed. My wife’s Chicken was almost tasteless and despite asking for leg/thigh (and that being confirmed by the server) she was given breast - when we asked the server about the dish she claimed it was thigh. She took us for idiots. The soup was a half portion.

My Char Kueh Teow was good without being spectacular. The Coconut Ice Cream was very nice and frankly the only highlight.

I suspect Chatterbox is suffering because of the ongoing “chicken crisis”. But in any event when we stay at the Hilton again, we’ll be giving this one a pass."
New Chatterbox,The food at chatterbox is still good. Mum ordered the seafood horfun. Their horfun had a generous serving of seafood. But they were quite stingy about the serving of green chilli on the side. Their famous chicken rice is slightly different now. The rice has gotten a lot healthier than in the past. My father did not like it. But i like the new and healthier version.
Very disappointed with the chicken,"The chicken rice used to be delicious and the chicken tender and succulent - but from my most recent visit on weekend, I found the chicken a far cry from what it used to be, presumably due to chicken supply issues. Especially for the price they charge it comprises their name and reputation to be serving the chicken of the quality they did"
Excellent food and service,Food was superb. Ambiance and service are excellent. Will certainly return to try other dishes. Fully recommended.
Early Father's Day lunch,"Ordered chicken rice, ba kut teh, rojak, satays and chendols.

I would say that the food overall was great. Just wished that the chicken rice has more of the hawker chicken rice flavour, was kind of plain. The ba kut teh didn't have the peppery taste, is more herbal for sure.

They did an interesting twist to the coconut milk in chendol, which was a panna cotta. I enjoyed it, but I guess if you are more of an old school foodie, you probably prefer the traditional kind.

On top of that, the waitress that serve us was really kind and patient. Helpful. Would like to thank her again, though I did not catch her name."
Best chicken rice in Singapore,"Chatterbox serves the best chicken rice in Singapore even though there is a lack of fresh chickens after the export ban of fresh chickens. At the same time, hope Chatterbox will offer more variety of vegetarian dishes (without onions and garlic). Excellent ambience for family dining"
Best chicken rice I ever had!,"Really really tasty and tender chicken meat. The meat amount is generous and the chili goes well with both rice and meat. Just that price is a little steep for some food items, esp dessert - the portions are quite small."
Most tasty & delicious chicken rice,Still one of the best chicken rice in Singapore. Nice ambience since their recent renovation. And excellent service staff.
Wonderful experience at Chatterbox,"I was curious to check out Chatterbox as they are famous for their atas chicken rice. I have to say that it is worth the price. The chicken rice is fantastic, from the soft fluffy rice to the texture of the chicken. The other recommended dishes are good too. The most impressive part of the experience was the service. The staff was very attentive, able to recommend. My elderly parents enjoy it a lot. Happy to bring them back again."
Mother's Day Dinner,"Service was great, food was great too.
Only a slight disappointment was on their rice that day. It was slightly on the moist side and it did not have the fragrance it usually has. But we will, for sure, be back again"
Total Disappointment,"We have been regulars at this restaurant for years but unfortunately this could be our last time visitingthe restaurant. Food standard has dropped big time as well as the portions have gotten smaller too. Laksa didnt taste the same, soup was thicker and saltier. Chicken rice didn’t taste the same, even my 15yo niece said it tasted so bland . Fried kway teow were alright but cockles were super tiny. Fortunately service stay the same, all the waiter & waitresses were as nice as they always are."
"Good food but poor service, dining and booking experience","The new chatterbox has rigid booking system where reservations seem to be full but we see empty tables for whole hour. Also we were unable to contact restaurant to make changes to booking even though hotline said they will pass the message. The new waiting area blocks the view with a large wall and no one bothers to check and inform when takeaway is ready. You have to constantly walk in and out to check. A small bowl of rice was given to eat with curry chicken rather than a plate. More thoughts should be given in the plating and eating experience. Although the food is good, the experience as a whole is extremely disappointing with the new Chatterbox."
"Excellent food, service and environment","Though food here is expensive, the service and the taste deserve the price. And also the environment is well arranged and makes one feel comfortable to dine in. Definitely making a return soon"
A fantastic restaurant to taste local food,"We ordered almost all signature dishes - chicken rice, rojak, laksa, hokkien mee, beef hor fun and coconut ice cream. Except for the beef hor fun which is slightly salty in our opinion, all other dishes are really really delicious. The hokkien mee was especially tasty as it have the wok hei taste!

Service staff were attentive and professional. Overall, an awesome dining experience."
Nostalgic visit,My last visit to Chatterbox was 4 decades ago. It's now beautifully renovated. My friends and I loved the ambience. Our set meal came with other delicious local dishes.
Strong air conditioning,Food is totally good but wind of air-con too strong for us. Hopefully it should be adjusted more mildly.
Not worth it,"Came for lunch after its recent renovation. Ordered the lobster laksa, one rojak, one single portion of chicken rice as well as half chicken with 2 bowls of rice for a party of four. The rojak ($15) was pretty tasty with a good balance of sweetness and saltiness. The lobster laksa was disappointing. The noodles were soggy and mushy while the 2 quail eggs felt undercooked. The gravy has little oomph you would expect from a good laksa. The biggest gripe was the chicken rice though. You would expect a half chicken to have at least 30-40% chicken thigh or wings but the half chicken we had came with almost 90-95% chicken breast. While the taste of the chicken was decent, its just not worth the $25 (single portion) and definitely not $36 (half chicken). Would I come back again? Not at all."
Lovely atmosphere and food!,We tried the chicken rice and it did not disappoint. The restaurant itself was beautiful and service was excellent and courteous.
Delicious Lunch,The food standard remain excellent after so many years; I and my wife enjoyed the signature chicken rice with prompt service. We ordered 2 sets of meal at the price of $50. Price are reasonable and the taste is fantastic. We requested to help us take photos and add extra soup are all fulfil with smile.
"Disappointed. Over-rated salty Wanton Mee, Congee, Chicken Rice","Stayed 2 nights at Mandarin Orchard. Had breakfast at their restaurant. As well as ordering their chicken rice set for my lunch. My review , for western breakfast, their omelette does not have any fillings, such as capsicum, ham, tomato , cheese etc. Their omelette is unlike some 5* hotel where the omelette is big. Scambled egg is unlike some 4* 5* hotels where it is slightly wet. The scambled egg was dry, and not up to our likings. Sausage wise is not those very bouncy type. Tomato was smashed up when we tried to poke forks in to eat. Only the potato wedges is crispy. For the sauce, only chili sauce was served with the western food. No mayo or tartar sauce to go with the western food.

Now, to the Wanton noodle we have on 23 Aug (Mon). The noodle and soup was way too salty. Is like the noodle was full of MSG, super super super salty. I am not a very picky person with salty food, but this noodle is the worst one I had for a restaurant. The noodle just had one pathetic vegetable. There is only 2 dumplings. The original price of the wanton mee is actually $19++, really tasted worst than the hill street BCM I had at $6.

Next, is the congee pork. Not much surprise also. Is just a normal congee with not much meat. I did also ordered their chicken rice set as it was very famous. To my horror, it does not taste superb, just good, not terrific. The chicken was not juicy, tasted quite similar to those I could get at some selected hawker center chicken rice stall. Those Chinatown chicken rice tasted much better at just 25% the price of this restaurant.

I was filled with high expectations as chatterbox was well known in Singapore and other countries. But, the food standard was really nothing to rave on, it was really super over-rated. Even when we are dining in the breakfast meal, I heard few people next to our table, saying that the food was not really up to standard for a 5* hotel. It was not very pleasant to tell the restaurant manager this, but it is indeed the truth. Having stayed at several 5* hotel, was really very very disappointed with the food standard, thought service standard was great though."
Deco and food can be improved,"1) The deco doesn’t seems as cosy as the old chatterbox on group floor, it looks more like a food court.

2) the chicken rice was ok, but the wanton soup taste weird and ngoh Hiang is also not up to standard.

Good think it’s 50% discount so it’s worth it. But unlikely to return soon."
Chicken Rice & Hockian Mee,Enjoyed our lunch at Chatterbox . The food was awesome. I like e Hockien mee than e chicken rice although i saw lots of good review for e chicken rice. Surprisingly the sago gula Melaka dessert was dam good . Overall we had a good experience at chatterbox.
My favourite chicken rice!,"My favourite chicken rice! Love the consistency of the dish. E-menu sucks, doesn’t work. So much faster to just order w the waiter. Service was good!"
More choices now,"We’re back and we’re very much delighted to find more items added to the menu. Ordering can be made now via QR code menu.

Still ordered our usual favorite signature dishes: lobster laksa and chicken rice.

Desserts were amazing: homemade coconut ice cream and sago gula melaka.

I love the presentation of the hot barley - flask of the hot drink, serving cup and sugar syrup on the side.

With Meritus Life & Style $100 dining voucher, the balance payment was $11, very well worth it."
Found hair in the rice,"We order chicken rice and found hair in the rice
The waitress then replace the bowl of rice for us
Not customer service recovery at all"
Disappointing Service,"Let me preface by saying that Chatterbox used to be one of my favourite restaurants. However, on my recent visit I found the service pretty bad.

1) No please and thank you of any kind throughout the whole experience. Even when someone was asking to take my temperature.

2) A waitress (who was acquainted with one of my dining companions) confirmed the order with her, in a private conversation volume and in Cantonese, which I do not speak. Also with no sort of eye contact to the other diners at the table. I happened to be paying for the meal.

3) When a small side dish of veggies was served, I noticed that there was a leaf hanging over the edge of the bowl and sticking to the side. Not a big deal, but not what I’d expect from a 5 star hotel restaurant.

4) When settling the bill, I walked up to the counter. The staff at the counter gave me no eye contact or acknowledgement of my presence and continued to print the bills for other tables without even saying anything to me. Shouldn’t the customer in front of you be acknowledged at least?

Food was... fine. To be honest my mood was dampened after 1, 2 and 3 happened, so I cannot say that I did enjoy the food.

Hopefully the staff can be retrained with better manners, but I doubt I will be visiting much in the future. Shame."
give it a shot/try.. チャターボックス,"Award-winning Chatterbox prides itself on the hugely popular Mandarin Chicken Rice which has evolved into one of Singapore's most celebrated local dishes. Other signature favourites in the menu in the menu include the Chatterbox Lobster Laksa and King Prawn Fried Hokkien Noodles. We had a staycation at Mandarin Orchard so naturally tried out Chatterbox, which has earned the Hall of Fame distinction as a Heritage Brand by SG Prestige Brand Award.
We were here for an early dinner, time 5:20pm and also seats a few tables.. Average décor that is not distinguishing enough for its reputation. In fact it is too cafeteria-like, and functional. For the chicken I chose chicken breast instead of drumstick, when asked upon. We also ordered a Curry Rib set, and both meal came shortly. The chicken meat taste just soft and well, while the skin was superb! The accompanying soup taste herbal-like, just a little, while the rice is fragrant and not oily. Each set comes with 3 standard dips (like most chicken rice meal served); dark sauce, tart chili sauce, ginger paste) They really complement the chicken rice! The curry for the Rib set is not too spicy and the 6 stacks of ribs taste just meaty. They come with cracker and rice too.
Nevertheless we were looking for more wow-factor, that appeared lacking for us. I was expecting a substantial serving but it was just average. Similar verdict as a few reviewers; It is rather hard justifying paying S$27 ++ a several multiples the price of other chicken rice in Singapore.
Just worth a try for us. ."
Soso only restaurant looks very normal,"The temp Restaurant looks like some cafe lobby, but food was good even tho slightly overprice standard drop for chicken rice, rice is less fragrance very average"
Great Service,"As always , nice and friendly service by a Pauline and her team . The standard of food has room to improve , wonder if it was a different chef."
The chicken rice is pretty average,Ordered via room service but was met with a very average chicken rice which lack the fragrance of chicken stock and pandan leaves. The chill was good though but wont recommend it due to its high prices and average taste.
5-Star Staycation,"Breakfast was at Chatterbox. Due to the social distancing, there was a queue in waiting but did not wait for too. Might need to wait for a while due to ala carte order. Overall service was fine."
tasty chiken rice,"There are variety of menus include drink and desert, The Chicken rice is photogenic and the nice taste too."
Awesome Mandarin Chicken sings with Lobster Laksa,"Had weekend dinner around 6pm, still able to walk in without reservation despite COVID. But it was crowded when we left around 7pm. So best to make reservation ahead.

Ordered the famous Mandarin Chicken, Lobster Laksa and Salted Egg Chicken Wings. I would say the Lobster Laksa bomb the house!! It's really tasty!! The broth is rich but still won't feel too ""Gelat"" if you know what I mean... The salted egg chicken wings are a good snack too! The Mandarin Chicken rice is good... at least I could tell others I've finally tasted the atas chicken rice haha... taste wise I think it's still alright.. the reason it is expensive I've heard because they use selected chicken that's exactly 1-month old ... not sure how true?"
Best Lobster Laksa and Chicken Rice,"During Circuit Breaker, I ordered from Chatterbox & Shisen Hanten twice, and was especially delighted to try the famous Hainanese Chicken Rice at 50% discount.

After the safe re-opening m, I signed up for L&S membership and came here for dinner. My husband really loved the Lobster Laksa, especially the gravy. As I don’t take seafood, I ordered the Shanghai noodle. The satay was a disappointment without the grilled/charcoal BBQ taste. We ended with Chendol, which was really nice.

Will be back for the Laksa & Chicken Rice again. Highly recommended to sign up for L&S with 50% discount for 2 diners."
Early dinner,I was here for an early dinner at 5.30pm . It is very quiet. I ordered char kway teow and it is very delicious. Vegetarian option is available too. The green apple juice is very refreshing after the meal. Staffs are very nice. Not av very fancy atmosphere but it is a clean place for dining. Great for huge family if u want something very normal.
Good food,Heard about the ever so famous 30 dollars chicken rice from family frens. Stayed in Mandarin orchard so we had breakfast here as well. Food was very good. Local foods are better than the American breakfast set. We ordered chicken rice for our in room dining. The set looked fantastic and tasted delicious. Restaurant is a fine dining ambience with local food. During checkout they gave us 50% discount.
Depressing breakfast place,What happened to this popular supper place from the 90ties. Extremely depressing atmosphere during breakfast.
Expensive but an easy option from the Mandarin,"Poor décor and atmosphere don’t help this place but the food was good
It’s décor is poor, it’s a café atmosphere but the food was excellent. Had the signature chicken rice dish and nasi goring which although OK, was expensive but we were staying in the Mandarin and it was easy to walk through the foyer to the café. Easy option without going out."
"Living on past reputation, too expensive and not worth it",Everyone knows the famously expensive Chatterbox chicken rice at Mandarin Orchard Hotel. I've eaten here three times. The first time was great because it was a new experience. The next two times were not so great as the quality kept slipping. I don't eat there anymore. I just can't justify paying several multiples the price of other chicken rice in Singapore when the quality doesn't measure up to its price.
Taste of the most expensive chicken rice in Singapore,"I've long wanted to try out the most expensive chicken rice in Singapore. To my disappointment, the chicken was neither tender nor flavourful. The taste of the soy sauce was a tint too salty, with the absence of the most important ingredient- sesame seed oil. The rice and soup was ok only. The chilli wasnt spicy enough. Any chicken rice that we can find in Ipoh is better than this. The service was bad as well. The staff was not familiar with the promotion and we had to ask to refill our glasses several times, even when the restaurant had few customers."
Good dining experience,"Wonderful local dishes and good service. The wait staff, Shin Ying & Suet Ying, were very dedicated and friendly."
Overrated,"Chatterbox is the restaurant known to have the best Hainanese Chicken Rice in Singapore. The hotel restaurant is very spacious. Staff is courteous, but not particularly efficient or enthusiastic. Food is mediocre, as most dishes are not hot enough. It is hard to believe that Chatterbox has won multiple awards with its Hainanese Chicken Rice (SGD 27 or USD 19.32), which tastes average at best and lacks the award-winning wow factor. I have definitely had better, and at a lower price."
Visit to chatterbox after many years later,"As a Singaporean,chicken rice has been one of food we eat every now and then. I had been eating chicken rice for the past 40 years, I can tell you what chatterbox serve is very normal, even hawkers can serve better chicken rice than them. And their service is also pathetic.... Thumbs down, don't waste your time there"
After 40 over years it is still the best!,"The have local fare like Hokkien Mee, laksa, Mee rebus, Nasi Lemark and local desserts like chendol & ice Kachang... highly recommended, provide price is not an issue."
Good but price is overrated,"Tried their chicken rice and Laksa and Rojak. As a Singaporean, there are many other places that serve similar dishes and taste as good but so much cheaper."
