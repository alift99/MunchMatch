"Great Food, Service to suit all","The food was absolutely fantastic we ordered a selection off the menu including the whole duck which was served to us 3 different ways, first with the pancakes, then the legs and finally chopped up and served with lettuce leaves! We had a wonderful evening thank you"
Bad service and Rude staff,"Bad Service!!! I wouldn't even give them a single star! I made an appointment 1 week before but received a cancellation only 2 days before the appointment date! And they didn't even bother to call me and I only found out when I read my email!

Called and asked if there is any way that they can reserve a table for me as the restaurant cancelled my reservation too last minute. But the staff raised his voice and said to me that ""this is your problem, I can't help you.""

This is absolutely ridiculous!!! How is that my fault when the restaurant who cancelled my reservation??? They should have blocked out the date in advance if it's already fully booked, so at least my booking wouldn't have gone through

I will never recommend this restaurant as the staff is really rude and inconsiderate. RUNNN!!!"
"Warm Ambience, Great Service, Great Food","Tops service and hospitality from Gan Yi Peng and his team.
The team gave us that warm welcome feeling, accommodating all our needs and requests.
Not forgetting the executive chef and his crew, the food was amazing, tasted great and well presented, can see they take pride in what they serve.
Most impressive, will be back again for sure.
A must try !!!"
Nice and Comfort Place,"Good services from the staff and the food is nice, price also reasonable. Highly recommended for those plan to have family gathering or wedding lunch/dinner."
Peking Duck,"Reservation for our 2 tables of five persons each promptly accepted with advice on use of Trace Together coupon for guests without smartphones. The piece de resistance is the Peking Duck deal at 30 per cent off, lovely slices to be wrapped in mantou or egg squares, thigh meat chopped up and the rest fried with e-fu noodles as requested. The yam ring was a winner too, chicken, prawns and peppers in the ring. Very large portions for the vegetable dish of cashews and asparagus as well and the tasty claypot tofu.
Service not too attentive as we had to call them over a few times for queries, hard to catch their eye though they were good at refilling the chrysanthemum tea. Not forthcoming too to inform us of complimentary parking (we paid with cash card $3.20 which didn't read well so had to solicit help) so I'd say service not up to fine dining standard."
Foodie place,There are many choices of food (love their dim sum) and great service here. And I love this ambient environment. This restaurant will be sure liked by foodie!
Nice place,"Comfortable environment, good services from their staffs, reasonable price with delicious food served. Highly recommended!"
Wonderful,"Nice place, good food , good service..love it..thank you for the service...Both managers also very good service üëçüèºüëçüèº"
Change in management,"Things are different now, including the taste. Used to be so much better in term of service and food - kes left‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
Bad service,"The food (Carrot Cake and 3 Egg Spinach) came undercooked, the carrot cake was sticky and mushy, the egg white in the spinach was still translucent. We informed the waiters of the uncooked foods, and they insisted that this is how they cook their food and that the egg white is already cooked (it was translucent and exactly like how it would be when you crack a raw egg). The dishes (cups and bowls) were also dirty, given that this happens at almost all restaurants, we gave them the benefit of the doubt and asked them to change, however, the waitress kept asking us to wait for almost 10mins even after most of our food was already served before we asked for the 4th time and then she brought it. We also realised that one of our dishes was not being served and asked them to check 2 times, which they returned to say that it was coming out, before we realised that they never keyed in our orders. They never apologised for the mistakes but rather accusingly spoke to us with a tone. They didn‚Äôt offer to change the foods that were undercooked but instead told us that they will just cancel it for us, there was no such rectification for their service."
Expired complimentary Car park coupon !!!,"When did the reservation, restaurant mentioned will give complimentary car park coupon to us. But when we left the restaurant, the complimentary Car park coupon cannot used at all at car park exit gate !!!"

1 For 1 Chefs Lobster Meal,"Tried the promotional 1 For 1 Chef Lobster Set during lunch and this 6 course meal tasted delicious. Started with a beautifully presented appetitive first dish, following a slightly thick yet delightful soup with dumplings and vegetables.

Third dish is the star which half a lobster seats on some salad completed with pumpkin sauce. Lobster meat will nicely cooked and head was fried to crispy. Abalone with mushroom was slightly smaller than expected but sauce taste good. Fried mee sua was not too heavy and dessert was mango pomelo sago that finish off the meal nicely.

Overall it was a lovely meal in a quiet setting and service was attentive.

This restaurant serves dim sums and Chinese dishes for lunch."

Superb Service for ROM event,"Recently helped a friend to organise his ROM solemnization event. It was quite last minute, and we have to find a restaurant who can accomodate us in very short notice. I msged the manager Kes, and she was very responsive in replying to my messages. She also took pictures of the set up a few days before to assure me that she has everything organised.

On the day of the event, everything was smoothly run. The food was good, and even the guests commended about the quality of the food is good. The price is also more than reasonable. Would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone."
"Delicious food, lovely ambience with great service!","Went with my family and we had Peking Duck together with a Lobster 6 course set. The Peking Duck was the highlight of the meal, do order the lettuce wrap option for the 2nd serving of the duck meat! Each course was thoughtfully served separately in individual portions which were just the right size. The Mango Sago Pomelo dessert was delightful. Meals like this would typically be a bit of a splurge but because of the current in house promotions, you would be able to indulge without hurting your wallet! Service was good and we enjoyed our dinner very very much!"

The dishes were plated beautifully and the our guests were gushing about the quality and taste of the food!

I would definitely come back here for a meal again!

ROM at Fu Lin Men,We choose to do our Fu Lin Men for our ROM because the food was great with a great host and the room was perfectly sized for our guests of 25.
Gastronomic delight,I brought my family for a dinner celebration at Fu Lin Men (CSC) and was recommended the 1-for-1 promotion set by Kes. We were not disappointed as the dishes served were delicious & nicely done. We liked especially the shark‚Äôs cartilage soup with wonton (has a nice tangy taste) and the baked lobster with creamy pumpkin sauce. It rounded off with a refreshing cold dessert to end our evening meal. Service was very good as they served the chrysanthemum tea for us at regular intervals.
Lunch,Highly recommend on their Tim Sum and Peking Duck. Value for money and food is super good! Thumbs up!
Food value for money and service was good,"Whenever we think of having Chinese food, Fulinmen at Chinese swimming club is our priority restaurant. The reason was the food was good and the service was friendly.
Two days ago we will there for dinner.

The manager, Cas patiently recommended the menu to us.

There's no need for us to head to Beijing for Peking Duck anymore,"I particularly like their Peking Duck. I have traveled to Beijing and tried Peking Duck from the creators ÂÖ®ËÅöÂæ∑, and a prominent Peking Duck restaurant Â§ßËë£. Frankly, I can't discern much difference between those offered by Fulinmen CSC and the two giants. Thumbs up. I patronized Fulinmen at the Chinese Swimming Club (CSC) on a CSC club membership but the restaurant is actually open to non-members as well."
Best for an authentic Chinese,"Best for an authentic Chinese cuisine experience, absolutely world class. Don‚Äôt need to travel all the way to Beijing for a first rated Peking Duck experience. Ensure to try the lime ice-cream and lemongrass jelly!!! It‚Äôs amazing!!"

Good Food,"Food was good, good ambience for family gathering without rushing for second session and everyone enjoyed the dinner."
"FuLinMen CSC, an excellent restaurant",We celebrated our CNY family dinner here at FuLinMen Chinese Swimming Club. Food was excellent for 6 out of 8 dishes. Service staff were friendly although a little overwhelmed as it was full house. No corkage charge and free car park coupons were a pleasant surprise. Overall a great value for money deal. FuLinMen CSC deserves our continued patronage.
Delicious and satisfying,"Just had a delicious and satisfying CNY reunion dinner with family. Even my fussy Cantonese mother has zero complaint on food quality, taste and service. Steamed marble goby fish was fresh and soft, double boiled chicken soup was flavorful, soya sauce chicken was tender and juicy ÂÖ•Âë≥, braised abalone with dried oysters was good, Ee-fu noodle has lovely truffle fragrance and red bean soup dessert has a light sweet taste. We have eaten at this restaurant over the past 2 years and enjoyed our meals, especially with both set of parents."
Excellent food and service,"I have eaten here twice before and thoroughly enjoyed the food and service. So when my sister and family from the US were here and looking for a place to have dinner, I brought them to Fu Li Men at the Chinese Swimming Club. The dishes we ordered were all excellent, smoked peeled prawns, soft shelled crab with salted egg yolk, pan fried sea cucumbers with minced meat, tou fu with dried scallops and sizzling pork cartilage. The pork cartilage was so tender and tasty that we repeated the order! The service was excellent and attentive. We brought a red and white wine and they used the appropriate wine glasses for the red and white wine! Impressive! And our plates were changed constantly. Kes ,the manager and her staff really provided excellent service. We had early Yu sheng and it was good too. And parking at CSC basement were easy and you get complimentary parking. Service charge is also waived if you are a member of CSC. Highly recommended."

The staff are ever pleasant and attentive . Kudos to Ms Kes and her staff for making my every trip here a pleasant one. Would recommend this place ."
"Great Food, Great Service, Great Venue for birthday celebrations",Kes the restaurant manager and her team has provided very good service for the birthday celebration. Service staff were friendly and attentive to the needs of our guests. They also make sure to time the cooking of the food close to the start of banquet to ensure the freshness and taste of the food. Many of our guest also complimented that the food taste good. Best of all is no MSG which will not leave the very thirsty after taste. Restaurant had a partitioned area good for birthday celebrations and huge area for deco.
"Excellent cuisine, wonderful service, beautiful restaurant!","We dined there in the middle of December of 2019, and it was also a weekday. The restaurant was not crowded, so my first memory is how AMAZING the service was! We felt like we had rented out the entire restaurant for just us (2 persons), and were treated as if we were VIPs. The staff was so fast, efficient, professional and friendly. I prefer quiet restaurants, so this was simply perfect for us. We loved everything we ate! I posted 2 pictures of what we ate; exact names of the plates, I don't recall. However, one was scallops and one was chicken; both exceptional. We also were given rice and a complimentary mango pudding, which was soooo delicous! (The mango pudding is on the menu to order.) We also ordered our own hot tea, also very good. When the bill came, we were given a 10% discount from the manager, as a kind gesture for the Holidays, as we were there close to Christmas--so kind of her. THANK YOU! She also called for/ordered a taxi for us, as well as waited for the taxi to arrive downstairs in the lobby to take us back to our Hotel. She really went out of her way for us, above and beyond service. We definitely recommend Fu Lin Men as everything was PERFECT! If we ever return to Singapore, we will also return to this restaurant in a heartbeat!"
Birthday Celebration at CSC FU LIN MEN,"First time celebrating birthday for my mother at CSC Fu Lin Men. Excellent service by Ms Kas. She help arranged the Birthday lunch for 16 people in a private room. Even when the restaurant was fully packed with people, she still arranged a staff to serve my family members in the private room. Food was good and fresh. The presentation of the meal was very impressive. Will definitely arrange to go there for further family gathering.
Both thumbs up for Ms Kas for making today an enjoyable event. You must look for Kas."
Good ambience,Been here several times and the food is superb. Service is excellent as well. Good place because its away from town and good for family gatherings.

Will definitely come back here again"
Tim Sum Lunch with family.,Had Tim Sum for lunch with 7 members of my family. Great service and food. Quite a wide selection from the Tim Sum menu and had request for repeated order for some dishes. And the price is very reasonable. Definitely will come back again.
Hidden Treasure of the East,"I was organizing my mother‚Äôs 82 birthday celebration. I contacted Kes Ng and she assisted me every step of the way literally day and night. I am living in the USA and was trying to organize a dinner party for 21 persons in Singapore. Due to the 12-hour time zone difference, I texted her during my night time and did not expect any immediate reply. To my surprise, she answered each message by return. It seems she works all hours! In addition, she was very patient and answered every little questions I had. I am a very demanding customer and expect a perfect dinner party. Kes lived up to my every expectation. The first impression of this restaurant was ‚Äúwow, what outstanding customer service!‚Äù
On the actual day, the food quality exceeded every guest‚Äôs expectations. The portions are generous and the waitress and waiters are so professional. All our guests were getting Kes Ng‚Äôs name cards at the end of the dinner as they plan to visit again.
Our family reside in the East side of the country and it can be quite challenging to find a great restaurant close by. The service, food quality and overall ambiance of Fu Lin Men are top notch. I highly recommend this restaurant."
Weekend luncheon,"A cosy chinese cuisine restaurant at the Chinese swimming club with ample underground parking .
The deep fried pumpkin lobster was tender fragrant n delicious.
The braised Ee Fu noodles with mushrooms was ecstatic and one of the best we have tasted.
Restaurant manager Ms. Kes was most welcoming and waiters were very attentive, our tea cups were never empty.
Highly recommended for family dining and private rooms available for my occasional business lunches.
Keep it up F.L.M."
Exquisite Cantonese Cuisine,"Delicious and unconventional Cantonese cuisines cooked without MSG. Efficient and friendly service. Private rooms for 12pp, 15pp or 5 tables (special event), and no corkage for own wine brought in. Parking is free too. We had sweet sour pork with lychees, braised tofu with assorted wild mushrooms, jumbo prawns with mayonnaise and corn flakes and stir fried chicken, prawns and vegetables in yam ring. The highlight of our dinner was the dessert - steamed yam paste with gingko nuts."
Our first visit to this restaurant,"Our first visit to this restaurant at Amber Road. Good food, attentive service under the care of Manager Kes. Reasonable price and cosy dining experience."

Excellent Restaurant for A Dinner Party,"6 December 2019

Just celebrated my nephew‚Äôs 1st birthday at Fu Lin Men at CSC. It was a very pleasant experience.

From the time I made an enquiry to book the tables, Kes Ng was very helpful and assisted us in every way necessary from providing timely assistance with menu selection, drinks selection to helping us secure a private room for the celebration.

She was very kind to answer any queries patiently and promptly, and ensured we had all possible needs taken care of.

During the day of the celebration, she was there to also ensure every detail was looked into and taken care of.

The staff were also great, and extremely accommodating. There was nothing we asked that was not attended to, and they made the evening smooth running and a success.

The experience was very positive, and all our guests (we had 5 tables) have enjoyed both the experience and the good food.

This is definitely a place to consider for any event gathering - the ambience is pleasant and the staff go the extra mile to make it memorable and enjoyable.

Would consider Fu Lin Meng again for future dinner gatherings.

Thank you Kes and team of staff!

Kelvin Yong"
Great food and excellent service,"We went to the restaurant for a gathering amongst friends and to celebrate a friend's birthday, and were throughly surprised at how good the food turned out. Most of the dishes we had were tasty without being salty, starchy or oily. Amongst our orders, the Peking Duck, Yam Basket and Kurobuta Pork with special sauce were very good.

The manager Kes and chef also surprised us with complementary longevity buns for my friend's birthday which were presented on a plate with handpainted flowers and Chinese calligraphy of ÂØø (meaning longevity).

Special mention has to be made of Kes' service which is top notch. She made sure that everyone at the table was well taken care of and had a enjoyable dinner.

Definitely a restaurant to come back again."
Fu lin men restaurant review,"Sumptuous, generous portions of delicacy at reasonable prices Great for family gathering, highly recommended"
Cantonese restaurant in the east serving value for money food,"Food is nice and service is great. My family enjoyed the dinner and the services rendered. We have ordered Peking duck, crispy roasted chicken, prawns, vegetables and other special recommendations by the staff. Food served are fresh and most importantly no MSG."
Delicious Cantonese cuisine and excellent service - open to public!,"Perfect venue with great ambience, service, taste and quality of food for our family celebration! We ordered the lobster set which showcased the localised Cantonese flavour. Dishes customised for less salt and oil - thank you!"
Value for money Cantonese restaurant at Chinese Swimming Club,"Having stay at GZ for the past 10 years,I was introduced to A must try,one of the best family and child friendly restaurants in the east of Singapore. No msg were used, dishes not only presentable but the original Cantonese taste remains."
Birthday celebration,"Very good service, excellent food and yet no MSG Special mention to Kes for the awesome hospitality. Will visit again!"
Good food made better with great service,We celebrated our dad's birthday at FLM in CSC branch. A complimentary set of birthday buns was offered for the occasion. Food was of great quality and their service was really commendable. Would come again for their Cantonese cuisine.
"First time, yet one of my favorite restaurants to patronize!","This was my first time ever visiting Fu Lin Men and I gotta say I was impressed by the food, service and the variety of dishes available on the menu (from set meals to ala carte). Firstly, what impressed me the most is how friendly the manager was; she was really passionate about her job and serves with pride, it really feels like you‚Äôre at your relatives‚Äô house where you‚Äôre well taken care of. The staff too, were very vigilant and also not slacking. When it comes to the food, it was all filled with pleasant flavors despite the restaurant claiming that 0% MSG was added which is a good thing. Overall, the food was really good and I can find myself coming here often, not every restaurant that I‚Äôve patronized so far leaves a good first impression but this however, is one of the rare ones that is just perfect. I highly recommend everyone to come to this restaurant with their family and friends and you won‚Äôt regret it."
Fu Lin Men @ Chinese Swimming Club,"Food was not bad and service was good. However, there was a birthday function held at the general dinning area (not in a private room as there were many tables) and it was very noisy. Would have given a 4 star if not of this. Please ask if there's any private function before you book."
