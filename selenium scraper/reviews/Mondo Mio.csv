Good hearty Italian food,It has been awhile since our last visit. The pizza and pasta are still as good as before! Had a great hearty meal and service was good too.
Meeting with Friends,The staff were polite and courteous. The food was delicious. I was able to catch-up with my friends and enjoyed my visit there.
"Lovely dog friendly restaurant, with extremely nice staff who kept checking in with us",Contrary to the negative reviews I had a fairly decent experience at this restaurant . Food was slightly above average and I thought the staff was really nice to check in with us on the food and wine. Agree that the pricing is on the higher side. However a generally pleasant experience and will come back here as they are tolerant to having dogs outside
Very below average,"I came back to Singapore to visit my family and we went to Mondo Mio for my farewell dinner. I remember that it in early 2021 the food and atmosphere was pretty chill and certain dishes were exceptional (such as the rissoto). I went there again recently and it had completely changed. The service was quite bad with very inexperienced servers who were quite awkward (the server didn't know the menu, they had to read out the food item as practice). The food? Expensive. Very average. The salad was extremely oily, the calzone was horrible, the signature pasta was bland and it didn't even come with parmassan cheese, we had to request for it. For deser I didn't want to be dissapointed so I ordered ""gelato"" which was obviously a very cheap ice cream that was very average as well. Overall I remember this restaurant being much better than it is today. If you plan to come here for a special occasion I do not recommend it."
Good food and affordable cocktail,Cocktails @ sgd 12++ i would consideraffordable given the location. We had a tequila and a pina colada both nicely done. I really liked my calzone ( more than Rosso vino's) and my wife equally liked the casarecce mondo mio suggested by Ganesh. We were full else i would have tried some other meat dish ( saving for the next time) - one improvement point it took more than 20 mins to wait for the bill. We will definitely come back
Soggy Bottom Pizza-Twice! and false advertisement.,"Beware of restaurants that have pictures of the food, not only throughout the menu but on the walls as well. I ordered the Capricciosa Pizza: the outside crust was burnt and the middle was so soggy that when I picked it up, all the toppings sopped off into a pool of undercooked mess. It was sent back only to get the same thing again. At least the cooks have consistency.
The wife ordered the ""fresh"" pasta bolognese as advertised. Definitely NOT fresh-made pasta. Didn't look fresh, didn't taste fresh. When asked, the waiter assured us that it was fresh... but then came back to say that it wasn't. We know Barilla pasta when we see it. Thanks.
Besides the food being falsely advertised and the crap pizza, the service was good until it was time to pay. I had to harang a few people for the check. No apologies, no discount. Not returning! Ciao"
Poor Start to a Singapore break,"We arrived on a late ish flight and fancied a beer and light snack for two couples. We ordered to pizzas at the same time with fries.
Both fries and our pizza arrived at the same time the second pizza some 25 minutes after, the pizzas were average at best.
To add insult to injury the average food plus two beers and a small carafe of wine came to ¬£83. Exceptionally poor value and service"
First try at Mondo Mio,"Food is mediocre or below par for the price point, definitely not worth the visit if patron do not have entertainer app to back them up. The vibe and interaction between the service staff and client are applaudable, However, as we are seated near the open kitchen, with the kitchen staff shouting and hooraying on some football match on a phone during cooking session is really a bad start. In the end, our food served is over seasoned (too salty) and over cooked. We didn't bother to request for a change of meal as we thought it will end up the same since the cook (cant use chef here as they aren't professional) are all engage with the phone except for the Indian sous chef.
Not gonna be back even if its 1-1."
Awesome dining experience!,Awesome dining experience! The food is v delicious and their tiramisu is a must try!! Definitely will be back again!
Bravo lady üëè service staff deserve applause.,"Came 4 dec Saturday around 2pm. Its was quiet and sunny day. But this lady staff whom she end her shift like 3pm , gave a memorable service even its my 1st time there. She willing strike conversations with almost any customer. She make this warmth afternoon so comfortable to dine here.. She create simple humour that keep conversations lively. She can be public relations to mondo mio..

Even the Italian owners or the chefs pass by us in and out of the restaurant just to smoke, they not even bother to look at us or even smile or acknowledge us..

Food wise was pizza affairs. Its was fragrant from the wood oven probably? Its has thick crust but was deliciously to munch suit my taste.. My friend did not fancy it. Its was generous portion.

Zul guess its the manager gave a obliging service to us..
No complaints though... chinese looking server and indian server was also ok.

Overall was pleasant experiences..

Stoat."
"Wonderful wine, complementary cheese, pleasant service","Why people prefer Wine Connection is a mystery to me while this place offers great service, good wines, a pleasant atmosphere and complementary (!) cheese."
Exceptions Food & Service,"We had just walked away from another restaurant after a distasteful experience.

But little did we expect with great food, superb service by all staff including the chef and cosy settings.

The staff were accommodating and the chef was able to customise this menu to make it more palatable for the children.

The waiter came and checked in on us and the kids and interacted well with the family.

Highly recommended."
Consistently Excellent!,"Discovered Mondo in November last year and have been going back regularly ever since.

Food is consistently excellent! Love their appetisers, my favourites: Carpaccio, Burratina and Melanzane alla Parmigiana are to die for. Their pasta is is perfectly al dente and their pizza crust is thin and crispy, so yummy. Go with their signature dishes, can‚Äôt go wrong. Special mention for their superb lamb shank! Fall off the bone tender and melts in your mouth.

Highly recommended for quality and well priced home style Italian cuisine!"
Nice Restaurant,Food is delicious with reasonable price and size. Table wines tastes good with excellent dollar value. Highly recommended Italian restaurant.
Exellent experience,"We been soon after the phase 2 was opened. Me and my husband needed to relax and to have a good Italian food. It was the first time for us in this lovely restaurant. We had a warm welcoming from the owner, the waiting staff was really good and very attentive. The pizza it was amazing,one of the best pizzas in Singapore (we are Italians so we can certainly racommend ). The chef came to introduce hiself and to check if everything was ok. Very lovely ambience and great hospitality. Very well racommended. We are going very soon again"
Keep up the good work! Will definitely be back,"We have been to Mondo many times in the past 10 years. After all these years, the service and quality remains commendable. The staff were patient with us as we ordered many items that evening. We couldn't help it as the food was delicious. It was one of the criteria we had in mind so as not to be disappointed on our Christmas Eve celebration.

We had 2 cold and 1 hot antipaste - tomato bruschetta, beef carpaccio, prawns and scallop capesante.
3 mains - Ravioli ai funghi porcini, a festive special of squid ink pasta and octopus with a lobster bisque typed sauce and a chef's recommendation with minced beef and truffle.
We ended the evening by sharing a dessert - Chocolate Lava cake and a bottle of prosecco. Everything was freshly prepared. Overall, we were satisfied and value for money."
Excellent Service and Great good - Italian food lover must try!,"Ambience of the restaurant was very cozy and romantic. All staff were really friendly and attentive. Of course all food we order were really delicious, the portion was quite generous too :) We will definitely come back to try different dishes!"
Disappointed with Service and Food,"We ordered both the pasta and pizza and were deeply disappointed by both.

After trying some of the pizza, we decided to feedback to the staff on the quality of the food and mentioned that it did not meet our expectations.

We were offered an exchange for a different pizza and the food was taken away from our table. However, just a few minutes later the staff returned with the same plate of food and berated us about having eaten some of the pizza before giving them the feedback.

I do not understand how we were expected to feedback without actually trying the food and we had no choice but to accept the same plate of food back. This certainly put a dampener on our evening, especially given that we were there to celebrate a birthday.

Will not be returning."
Don‚Äôt bother,It was one of the only restaurants in the area with seating left. Now we know why. The tomatoes on the bruschetta had obviously been prepare well ahead of time and were ‚Äòmushy‚Äô and tasteless. Service was slow. The fettuccine was rushed and incorrect consistency. We waited 20 minutes for the dessert before we called the waiters attention and another 15 for it to arrive. The creamy cheese cake had an odd taste. So we will not be returning.
Awesome food and wine!,My friend and I had such an awesome time at this place. The food was delicious and the wine recommended went so well with our meal! The lava cake was just the best way to end our Italian meal. What a great way to have a ladies night out. Will definitely be back again. Thank you once again!
Not my favorite Italian,"It's not bad but its far from great. Conveniently located in Robertson Quay. We had pasta (gnocchi 4 formaggi) lacked of taste unfortunately and the lamb, was ok but poor for a main. the appetizer, we had the shrimp and scallops, that literally we had 2 shrimps and 2 scallops...that I get it if I'm at the top of the top restaurant but for an Italian friendly? Not cheap... nice staff... Overall, one more of the pile..."
My new goto pasta place,"My new goto pasta place.

Got to know that they do have a new italian chef from napoli.

And this is the way the pasta is done. Can only recommend it. Tried the carbonara, the squid ink pasta and the minced beef ones - all great.

Uncomplicated, nice service, fair prices."
favorite pizza for my family,one of the best place to visit on special occasion with family and friends. services staff are very friendly and caring. seafood pasta was very nice.one of the best pizza in town .my kids are like very much ............must try it. finally tiramisu really good...........
Great food and lovely staff.,Great food and lovely staff. I had a tasty pizza and my wife enjoyed the seafood pasta. The ambiance is relaxed and very traditionally Italian.
Favorite restaurant after work,We went here twice and they never let us down. The service is consitently wonderful. Food is delicious. We make it become our regular spot for dinner after work
Good food at good prices,"We were staying at a hotel close by and ate dinner here on a couple of occasions and found the food to be very good, service was speedy and the wait staff were very pleasant and friendly. However, it was only pasta, pizza and salads that we ate but it was all delicious and certainly hit the spot at the end of a day's sightseeing."
Singapore Holiday,"A great restaurant. We ate at Mono Mio on at least 4 occasions - lunches and dinners during our 10 day stay. The service by the young ladies at this restaurant was excellent, helpful and friendly. The food was very good and reasonably priced. During this time in February 2020 they had one for one offers on certain meals from Monday to Thursday. Definitely worth a visit. Very important was that the beer was cold."
Great Price - Quality Meal,"Came here one evening before a show. The specials/HH prices had about 5 minutes left and the waitress (Michelle) made sure we were in on time and knew that this was the case which is great.

The pasta and pizza dishes we had were spot on and a great price. Service was excellent with Michelle going above and beyond to offer some extra chilli padi as she noticed we liked our food hot.

Thanks! We just wish we had more time to try some of the desserts."
Words cant describe...,"I visited this restaurant a few months ago with my partner, to this day we still laugh at our experience here.. truly the worst Italian food I'v ever had. This restaurant is the perfect example of how western food is not only bad in Singapore, but you pay an exorbitant amount for it. We opted for the lunch time special and the entree consider of a wilted tomato sliced into quarters... the main was under cooked pasta that had almost no flavor whatsoever. To top it off we payed around $30 each for this. We did however have a very nice waiter! Too bad about the food."
Lovely meal,Looking for somewhere to eat we stumbled upon Mondo Mio. A great find. They do a 2 for 1 pizza and pasta deal. The pasta was excellent and the gnocchi outstanding. Drinks are very reasonably priced (for Singapore). Desert did not disappoint the tiramisu was beautiful and my husband enjoyed his sorbet. A great meal at a great price.8
nice place for a business lunch,"lovely meal here, very quiet at lunch time, great for business lunch lovely home mad pastas good service"
Anniversary Surprise.,"We ate at Mondo Mio when we holidayed in Singapore in 2018. We loved it. Returned on our trip home from Europe this year. The staff remembered us from last year, when we returned for our anniversary dinner, the manager surprised us with champagne. We had a very tasty meal, they surprised us with a dessert on a platter with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate topping. He topped off the evening with lemon cello with the coffee. We had one of our most memorable anniversaries, and as it was our 33rd, we have a few to compare it to. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
I‚Äôm so full and it was great,"Working out pretty hard so we went to Robinson Quay for Pizza as a treat.
We knew there were Italian restaurants we had visited before but we ventured out to Mondo moo that we never tried before and the food was perfect
Very quiet on a lazy Late Sunday afternoon but the more attention we got.
I ordered mozzarella to start great and then Osso Buco which I love to cook but can never find in Singapore.
Actually I loved the side dish of mushrooms and the risotto was perfectly cooked.
I loved the fact that I could order a carafe of wine from a relative good selection"
Rather disappointing but needn‚Äôt have been.,"My partner ordered a pizza, which he enjoyed and I ordered the signature dish, which is the reason for my disappointment. This dish is supposed to be home made short ribbon pasta with a mince, porcini and cream sauce. When the dish arrived is was commercially made penne pasta with the sauce. The reason I ordered the dish was because I love home made pasta so it was obviously a surprise when the dish had penne. If they had told me when I ordered, I would have chosen something else but no one bothered to tell me. The sauce, in the end was nice, although a little lacking in mince, but the actual pasta was average. When we complained, they took $2.50 off the price of the pasta, which wasn‚Äôt the point."
Standard Italian Dishes,"Although it was a Saturday, the restaurant, and actually; the entire complex was quite empty. Perhaps the complex and her outlets tailor more to the evening crowd. In fact, when I left, only a few the the tables outside were occupied. The restaurant is spread over two lots, with one side being the restaurant, and the other a bar.

One could choose from the ALa Carte menu, or if you are dining in the evenings; the Set Dinner menu. For reasons that make business sense, set lunches are not offered.

The menu comprises of Italian faves, with pizzas and pastas taking pride of place in the menu. The wait staff was able to tell me what the soup of the day was. In addition to the Tomato Soup, lunch for me was the Penne Pomodoro. Both dishes were well cooked, tasty and portioned nicely.

I would have loved to stay on for dessert, but I had to rush off to my next appointment; giving me a reason to return."
Hearty Italian fare,"Casual eatery along the waterway with pretty decent Italian fare. Loved the signature Mondo Mio pizza with Parma ham and a perfectly crisp crust.
Tomato bruschetta was very good and the garlic bread tasty. We enjoyed the aglio olio, ravioli aragosta and spaghetti carbonara.
Service was both prompt for some things and inattentive for others - Had to ask for iced water 3 times before it came after 4 dishes had already come and then it was one short. Kitchen was efficient with most dishes coming out very quickly except the pizza which though it was ordered as a shared appetiser came out after we had finished our mains."
"Great experience. Authentic Italian food, helpful staff",The food is very tasty (High quality ingredients)! The chef is Italian. We love the carpaccio and lasagna. Plus VERY reasonable price.
Favourite Italian food!,"Guess I‚Äôve came to Mondo Mio for more than 10 times. Easily from my phone I could search more than 20 over dishes. They served very delicious food. Although, sometimes is slightly difficult to get their attention because they were running around. But other than that the food was excellent. Bought a family of 10 during Mother‚Äôs Day. Lamb was very juice and tasted very delicious. ($40) pizza & pasta never disappoint us ($ ranging from $20 to $30+) lava cake is still the best same goes to their classic tiramisu! At the end of the day every one was very happy with their mains. Portion was good for sharing too! Very value for money for the such a standard."
Indifferent Service,"I fancied Italian and came across this place.I looked at the menu outside and liked what ai saw and was shown inside and to my table by a very pleasant waitress. My order was taken by another waitress.I asked for a bottle of sparkling water and what white wine did they offer by the glass. I was told Pino Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc.I chose the latter and asked for the drinks right away.The restaurant was not too busy three other tables with about seven customers.In the next room was a bar and there seemed to be a party of mainly drinking males.The whole staff seemed to be concentrating on them.After about 10 minutes I managed to attract the waitress‚Äôs attention.I asked for my drinks and was told they were coming.After 15 minutes they arrived.The wine was very pour.The first course arrived at 25 minutes it was mussels and clams in a white wine sauce.It was a good serving and tasted very nice. Immediately on finishing my main course of Fettucine Gamberi arrived.Pastawith tiger prawns and scallops in a delicate tomato sauce.The pasta was good and sauce very good but only 3 prawns and not big ones and two small scallops.
I asked for the bill and was hovered over until I produced payment. $66.50 No thanks or goodbye when leaving"
"Fantastic Restaurant, brilliant chefs","We visited this restaurant three nights whilst staying in Singapore.
We had 3 lovely nights staff are great, they are very attentative, and pleasing.
The food is of excellent standard, and cooked to perfection./
We love the fact that where the chefs cook whilst sitting in the restaurant you can watch them grill and prepare your foods.
Can recommend the steaks and pasta dishes.
Good selection of wines,
This restaurant has to be a favourite.
Dont miss the experience."
Decent place,"We had pizza and pasta, of course. It was good. Taste and the size of portion very decent. Good quality prosecco and montepulciano."
Great food with nice ambience!,"Went down on a Saturday night to check out their pasta and pizza 1-for-1 promotion.
Highly recommend the Garganelli Mondo Mio pasta, really flavourful with just the right amount of creaminess. Also recommend the Virgin Mary cocktail that really packs a punch! Would love to check out their bar area in the near future!"
Quality italian style meal.,"After a lapse of 3 years without a singapore visit i have had the opportunity to revisit some of my old favourites.
Mondo mio is situated in a less touristy part of the river area just along from clark quay at robertson quay,a far more laid back area full of bar and restaurants with a residential atmosphere.As far as mondo mio is concerned they have maintained there high quality and highly efficient staff and in singapore this is no mean feat.as far as food is concerned all the usual itialian suspects are present with high quality ingredients and ample serves the prices are competitive with no surprises at bill time.
Well done zai and the girls looking forward to my next trip.CJ"
Lovely restaurant,Great place for a meal- had to rush off but wished we could stay longer. The 1 for 1 deal was a nice offer- will have to come back again to spend more time there:)
A Fine Italian Restaurant in an Enchanting Locale: Mondo Mio,"Restaurants of almost every genera clutter the narrow strip, the trendy river walk on the edge of the Singapore River in Robertson Quay, Singapore. Though the tropical heat is the norm in the city, gentle breeze often waft through this strip, turning it somewhat pleasant.

Our in-house Italian-food connoisseur, my 12 year-old grandson, after much search and thought, chose the restaurant and made the reservations. Incidentally, after the dinner he approved the food. The place was crowded, but as we had reserved seats, we were immediately seated in the air-conditioned lounge. Pleasant outdoor seating is also available.

Mondo Mio claims that they serve authentic Italian cuisine, and only Italian food. The menu was Italian and diverse. All typical Italian dishes are available. The dishes we ordered came without much delay and the quality was good. The wine selection is very good.

The restaurant staff is helpful and efficient. The service is good.

This is a fine Italian restaurant in an enjoyable location. No one would regret selecting it for dining in Singapore."
Pizza with an egg,Pizzas were very good particularly their specialty pizza with an egg two pasta dishes not as good with dishes served only warm and not fully cooked
Nice place for an Italian dinner,Felt like Italian for a change so visited Mondo Mio not far from our Hotel (Park Hotel) at Robertson Quay and had a very enjoyable meal of pasta. Wine was nice and unusually for us we even had dessert which was absolutely divine - would visit again.
Great Food and Great Service,"Fantastic food and great drinks. Lovely area and atmosphere, not to mention the lovely staff - which just makes for a perfect meal."
Amazing food and lovely service,"We came late at night and have the most amazing service, staff were attentive and drinks were beautiful!! Authentic.. best meal I had had so far in Singapore"
Great Food and Friendly Service,"We arrived quite late at night after flying into Singapore and asked if they were still serving food. I think they were just about to close the kitchen but were happy for us to order some dinner. The handmade pasta that we ordered was delicious and served hot and well prepared. Drink options were great and were served nice and cold.
Service was very friendly and welcoming.
Really enjoyed our quick late night stop in to this Italian Restaurant."
A nice saturday night italian restaurant,"Proper italian restaurant with vaste choice of appetisers, pastas and pizzas. We opted for the fresh burrata with ham and pizza as main dish. Everything really good: quality and taste-wise. Price slightly above the median but in line with the restaurants in the neighbourhood."
Italian? Verryyyy bad,Shells in the seafood pasta...and sand as well Oasta overcooked Food bland an oily Blah... Really bad service No manager around Fast food quality Not authentic italian Will go elsewhere
Very poor service,Understaffed. No cocktails available. Overall very poor service - clearly it's not what it used to be
Walked past... menu you looked good and was amazed by the food!!,"Liked their menu board when I walked past! Menu has some great items on it, different to other Italian places, more of a Singapore twist.. but how good was my main.. but a tiramisu on a menu is always going to catch my eye... this kitchen nailed it.. boom...
what a surprising little kitchen"
Third visit,"Have been here 3 times in 3 different trips to singapore and have enjoyed it each time. Service is always good, food is good and house wine is very nice and for Singapore reasonably priced."
Nice place and decent Italian food,"Went to Mondo Mio with three friends for dinner and we enjoyed outside table on the terrace. Overall, good ambience, service, and pasta dishes. The quality of the Italian entrees were above average and they had 5 type of beers on tap including Guinness!"
Expensive and average,The outdoor seating is good and Robertson Quay is nice area but a glass of house Pinot Grigio and a main of Scialatielli was $40. You need to remember in Singapore that the price on the menu does not include the 17% taxes they are going to put on when you pay. The service was fine but the pasta could have cooked slightly longer.
Nice place and Ok food 5/15,"First of all I would like to point out the eating in Singapore is VERY EXPENSIVE and so is WINE

We order Garlic bread which was nice and fresh with with lots of garlic

Next came the pasta dish main meal to share which was really small, if you ate it as a main meal you would feel hungry afterwards.
THE PASTA WAS FROMA PACKED AND A BIT RUBBER

WE THEN ordered a pizza which we were not impressed

The staff were very pleasant and attentive

The setting is really great

There are so many restaurants situated many restaurants with
Italian around you would think there would be competing against each other, BUT NO"
Group visit.,Tour group. Set menu with a few choices. Food great as was the service and staff. Drinks reasonable. Recommended
"Great Atmosphere, Great Italian Food, Friendly Staff","I have been here 3 times in my last 2 visits to Singapore. Friendly staff, always trying to accommodate you, serving good quality food until late. Icy cold beers on tap and good selection of wines. Check it out!"
"Nice Italian food, especially loved the pastas",We happened to walk by and decided to give this at for dinner. Ordered a pizza which had an egg in the middle and the lobster ravioli. Pizza was ok as we would like to have more thinly crusted. The lobster ravioli was delicious. Will come back for the ravioli.
Bellissimo,"Who would have thought an Italian restaurant in Singapore could hold its own compared to one in Roma, well this one can.

We ate here tonight, staff were incredibly friendly, diligent and through, meal was piping hot, fresh and of the highest quality, we observed the chefs and kitchen staff interacting whilst the meals were being prepared, you could tell they take pride in their meals and all have a great working relationship, would highly recommend this restaurant"
Best place for Vongole Pasta,"I am a fan of Vongole pasta and theirs is my favourite in Singapore! by far the best to me! The homemade pasta is done just nice, with slightly starchy vongole sauce (in a good way) sticking onto the pasta. They are generous with the clams as well! Its especially ""sweet"" now as they have a 1 for 1 pasta and pizza promotion on weekdays between 530-730pm. Please try it!"
Fairly good,"Interesting place with nice outdoor tables.
The service was very good and smiling, we enjoyed it.
Good decent menu of Italian specialties and a pleasant wines list too with an accent on Italian wines of course, but not only.
We tasted the pizza and some pasta and both were good.
Not cheap, but a nice address to discover."
Disappointing Guinness and Pinot Grigio,"We dropped into Mondo Mio on our stroll late afternoon on a weekday as we fancied a drink. I ordered a Guinness which was on draught but tasted bitter and a little watered down. My wife had a glass of Pinot Grigio which also disappointed.

Service was pleasant enough and our table options included indoor or outside as we were the only customers at that time.

Location just off the main river walk in a pedestrian precinct is good for people watching and just relaxing la fresco. That said, there's plenty of competition to try next as Mondo Mio didn't impress us."
Wonderful service,"Made a reservation online for 2 but had a last minute addition of a third; restaurant was happy to accommodate the change. Service was top notch, wait staff friendly and polite. Food waiting time reasonable.

Quality of the meal was acceptable. We ordered the caprese salad and eggplant parmigiana to share. Our main course included a seafood thin crust pizza (delicious) a black cod with mash, and the seafood ravioli. Only remark is the portions might be considered small for hungry diners.

They run a 1 for 1 pizza/pasta special which makes it quite good value. Mid range prices."
a nice surprise,"i went back with my family after a few years and i was surprised to find a completely new place. not only the restaurant is bigger and with a new fresh style, but also management and chef are new and they definitely know how to make a difference."
Good Italian menu,"We ordered two simple pasta dishes ‚Äì both plentiful, tasty and well presented.
Service was a bit hit or miss ‚Äì had to search for the waitress to get a second glass of wine and for the bill at the end. This was a Sunday evening and service might have been better if they had been busier.....

As happens so often in Singapore, the house white wine is a poor choice, so it‚Äôs necessary to pay a higher price to get a half-decent wine. Reds are usually OK.

Our bill for 2 pasta dishes and 3 glasses of wine came to $84 including 10% service charge and 7% GST."
Pizza and wine,"After an evening of brisk walking along the river, we came upon this cafe at Robertson Quay. One for one pizza promotion was what attracted us and both pizzas(thin crusted) were satisfying. Perfectly paired with a bottle of Pinot Grigio. Great value!"
"Lovely location, beautiful food","We came here a few times during our Singapore stay and the food was lovely. Really fresh, homestyle Italian dishes, delivered with fantastic service. Our waiter was very cheerful and very attentive. I highly recommend the lasagne and the bruschetta, the lasagne has a real home taste to it and the bruschetta is so punchy and fresh."
Cosy. Pet Friendly.,"I brought my dog for a walk at Robertson Quay yesterday and chanced upon this Italian hidden gem. I always appreciate restuarants that are pet-friendly! Service staff Leah was an awesome waitress, she never lets our glasses go empty. Food was served timely and tastes great, the lava cake was yummy too. I can say that most reviews here are accurate and I will come back again! Thumbs up for Mondo Mio for the superb service and food."
Quality Italian fare at very reasonable prices,"The recent reviews are all correct - the homely feel, great service, good food, very reasonable prices. From the outside, you might have the impression of a much more expensive establishment.
I have been to Mondo Mio several with my family, and I find the fare very consistent in quality and service. The quality of the food is good as befits an Italian restaurant. I tried the carbonara (it's on the kid's menu, but they will do for adult-sized portions), lasagne, pizza, and they are all delicious. The price ($18-22) is not only reasonable, but cheap, considering that many cafes serving the same fare but of standard quality charges the same. The beef steak ($42) is surprisingly large, delicious, and really value-for-money.
The desserts are (just) a little expensive, but worthwhile if you want to round off dinner with something sweet. For instance, Chocolate lava cake with ice-cream is $13 but very nice. If you do not want to spend too much, I suggest just ordering a main course."
Fantastic!!,Really good restaurant staff very friendly and helpful! Delicious and abundant thanks to the chef Antonio!
YUM! YUM!,"Great place for a great feed at very reasonable prices!
We had the mushroom risotto, Pizza, steak and a spaghetti bog. All yummy!
Couldn't fault the service or the very well priced food. Only criticism would be the cost
of the wine.....but then again, all wine is expensive in Singapore!"
Homey Italian restaurant üëçüèª,"Such a nice place to visit for quiet dinner! ‚ú® food was yum, pistachio tiramisu was to die for, good hospitality, felt homey, warm and relax. Will visit again in future"
Too much mondo,"Was sitting down outside with a pizza and a red wine.
The pizza wasn't exceptional, you can get the same pretty much everywhere around Robertson Quay. The location is good and the furniture isn't falling apart so you can't complain.

Mid way in my pizza one guy had enough of the mondo and decided to empty his stomach just behind me and just about around my feet. I can't blame the pizza but I quickly lost my appetite for pizza and wine at that point.
Skipped across the few dry places where this guy hadn't left his breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks to get in to pay and get the heck out of dodge.
What surprised me and the neighbour table was that the front desk staff completely ignored the fact that we paid to get out of the smell of sushi marinated in stomach acid and there's no offer of compensation what so ever.
I've been around Singapore and I'm pretty sure we'd be given a compensation in most places.

Summary:
1. Food isn't fabulous
2. If something hits the fan you still pay full price.
3. I'm not coming back in a hurry."
BAD SERVICE,"BAD AND RUDE SERVICE!!!!!
Terrible service, food is ok only yet expensive.
But most terrible is the level of service attitude.
After trying to convey feedback about our dining experience, the boss appeared offended and kept making excuses in a super condescending manner.
Do not visit!"
Best pizza,Mondo mio pizza is amazing and the t bone steak is outstanding. Well done guys looking forward to coming back
An Italian island along Robertson Quay,"Looking for a place to dine I chanced upon Mondo Mio, a quaint Italian restaurant divided in two sections: the Al Fresco part, along the main passage, and the air con inside. My guest & I chose the latter, where a beautiful fresco of the Canal Grande of Venezia crossed by a life size gondola stands out like an imaginary window. The Maitre D'. Massimo Aquaro, was very competent in recommending us an amazing air flown burrata, and swift in assuring that it was promptly delivered. Unobtrusive, professional and kind, Massimo suggested us choices to choose from and did inquiry on hat we could or could not eat. This kind of service, present yet not suffocating, caring but not overselling, is what made our experience enjoy the tasty cuisine of Mondo Mio. Either if you are visiting Singapore & missing Italy, or if you liv ein Singapore and enjoy Italian food, go to Mondo Mio and ask for Massimo, the soul of this gem."
Wonderful evening,It was a very good ambiance and a romantic dinner with my beloved loved one...thanks for a wonderful food and the service was impeccably divine...
Mid night Pizza,Where do go in Singapore if you still dream to have late dinner ? Mondo mio is the right spot. I was there two days go with a good friend of mine and we had our fantastis authentic italian pizza at 23:30.
Late dinner at Robertos Quay,"I got to Robertson Quay rather late for dinner. Mondo Mio kitchen was still open, ordered a pizza which was very good, just to make the night totally enjoyable I was able to watch a champions league match.
Restaurant Manager Massimo (well known in the industry) was a great host, as always!"
Great pizza,I went yesterday to Mondo Mio and tried their famous pizza following TripAdvisor reviews. Outstanding
late dinner,Mondo Mio Italian restaurant on Robertson Quay has got the best idea ever keep open their wonderful kitchen way after midnight
Hungry late at night? Kitchen open until 1.30 AM now!,"Last night i landed late at changi, and after one week with local and street food around taiwan and korea (which i actually enjoyed) my stomach really needed some good pasta or pizza
I go to mondo mio quite often, the taste is very italian and the food is good, price is also good compared to the quality served,

I expected to get a salad, considering the hour close to midnight, however i found out that now the kitchen is open until 1.30 AM!!

This is a plus that you don‚Äôt commonly find in singapore restaurants anymore

Hungry at night? You know where to go now!"

Best value for money in Robertson,I tried Mondo after reading so many reviews and I found that the t-bone is the best in town. I believe some reviewer are not sincere when they criticise such a wonderful place
Not so good and poor value,We were hoping for a romantic dinner. We qere soooo disappointed. Some food seemed rushed and not fresh...even came not so hot. Service lacking from unfriendly girl.
Busy but romantic,Me and my hubby been to Mondo for bites and pre drinks. The place was so attractive that we decided to stay the whole night. Lovely
Bad quality,"On the way to a meeting we stopped for lunch. The water was lazy and took forever to bring the menu and the place was almost empty. His expressions were of utter indifference ...no smiles.
The food was of poor quality and taste...
Overcooked the food. Looking at some of the reviews we noticed that immediately after a customer posts a review...the management rudely answers with a response that is very bad and not caring about the customer...then you get blasted by a series of ""reviews"" from ""italian"" experts praising the restaurant. We feel this is fake and supports what seems to be the managements cynical treatment of paying customers. What a miss...if you do not like bad service and poor quality food then stay away..so expensive for the terrible food they provide and all is supported by an arrogant management attitude."
