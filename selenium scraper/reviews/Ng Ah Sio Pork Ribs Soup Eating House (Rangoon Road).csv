Tasty and authentic,"Opened very early. Family and I had a good bak kut Teh (pork ribs soup) brunch.

The restaurant has pictures on the walls of celebrities who had visited the walls in the past. This is a first visit for us and we spend some time admiring the pictures while waiting for the food.

The food taste authentic. Just the right mix of pepper and garlic."
lunch,"came here for lunch with my friend. i think this is one of the better ones, loved the peppery soup and side dishes. service is fast and friendly."
Good food,"They have really food food at their place and good drink also, they food were being served really fast"
Late lunch,"First time visit. Heard about this Bah kut teh place but never visited till I chance upon one day. Went at around 2.30pm. Almost after lunch hours therefore, the staffs are cleaning up the tables and most diners are already leaving. Still we have to wait as they need to take our temperature due to Covid 19. Was guided to a table, order was swift and food came quite fast too. I like the soup as it was peppery enough for Bak kut teh. I would prefer the Pork ribs yo be slightly softer. Braised Bean curd skin was nicely done. Pork trotter was fragrance and cooked through. Will visit again. Soup were replenished automatically but not hot enough."
The best Bak Kut Teh in Singapore!!!,"Being a person who enjoys both the Malaysian and Singaporean type of Bak Kut Teh, I can vouch this as the best type of Singaporean BKT. The Malaysian version is a bit different with more ingredients and a darker soup, where else the Singaporean version is the clear peppery, garlicky broth."
Bak Kut Teh with Free Refill,"Ng Ah Sio Pork Ribs Soup Eating House (aka Ng Ah Sio Bak Kut Teh) is a popular local restaurant specialized in Bak Kut Teh, a Chinese herbal soup cooked with pork ribs and pepper. The restaurant provides free Wi-Fi access. However, they don’t take reservations, hence there is often a long line of diners at the front door. The restaurant is spacious and clean, but without AC, it is quite hot, and the round chairs might not be the most comfortable. The owner is very friendly and enthusiastic. Servers are efficient. Highly recommend the peppery Premium Loin Ribs Soup (SGD 11.80 or USD 8.50), which is very hot, tasty, and REFILLABLE! They also sell the Bak Kut Teh soup base packs (SGD 14.95 or USD 10.70 per box of 4 portions) at the cashier, for guests to recreate the flavor at home or share with friends as souvenirs."
Peppery bak kut teh,This place is our current favourite for pork ribs soup. The braised dishes are good too. Service is prompt and friendly.
Signature food of Singapore,"This place is said to be one of the most-visited pork ribs soup dining spots in Singapore. Unlike dining in restaurants in luxury hotels, dining in this place is like having food at home, more casual, more home-taste, and more relaxing, of course, the food is beautiful as well."
Old school Bak Kut Teh,"Went here with a local friend and the Bak Kut Teh here was very tasty. Peppery and they top up the soup if needed free of charge.

The other dishes on offer were also excellent.

All in all classics kept the old way is the best."
Yummy soup base,"We ordered the most expensive pork ribs and believed the pork could be more tender. Soup base is good with unlimited refill. We also ordered other dishes like pork kidney, and liver. Rice was quite hard but that is not the main dish but could be better if they serve with better grade rice."
Best Bak Kut Teh,"Still the best in town after so many chains have come after their business, the main stall is an eatery right on Rangoon Rd with parking along the street. The soup mix is peppery without being too hot, and with every bite of the soft flesh coming easily off the ribs, you’d want to have another sip or two. It’s a joy to dip the ribs in the black sauce slip one slice of red chilli on top and enjoy the contrast of all 3 in your mouth. Good thing is they refill your soup at no charge. A Singaporean foodie institution for sure!"
Bones for gourmands,"We had the premium ribs & combo. Peppery soup with boiled rice and fried dough sticks. A bit of self service with the tea and disposal of pie rib bones. No air conditioning so be prepared to sweat a little. Otherwise a cultural experience in herbs, pepper, tea and rice."
Well deserved famous bah kut teh,"Ordered the rib, pig skin, tau kee and veg. The rib is tender and soup is thick and delicious . The skin is well braised without fats. Reasonable price."
Great service,They specially change the normal stool to chair with back for senior person without having to request. Nice and kind service.
Best Bak Ku Teh,This is one the best Bak Ku Teh in town. The soup and innards are good for people that enjoys a good traditional and high cholesterol lunch :). Service is good and the price is reasonable
Great flavoured pork ribs,"In addition to tasty & tender pork, they served very strong flavoured soup (which is a plus for me) and nicely cooked rice."
It’s nothing like before.,Will not eat again. Thankful I had a lot when it was nice. Used to slurp the soup non stop. But now it’s too much after one bowl.
Pork bone soup - a must visit,"Avoid the lunch crowd, always head there after 1.30 pm. Never order the liver. Go for the premium bones. Worth the travel to this random corner of Singapore."
All the right stuff,"Good Bah Kut Teh as we know must have spicy soup, tender meat and come with side dishes like salted vegetables, you tiao, etc. This place certainly has them all. Service is also friendly and we don't feel being rushed which is nice."
A blast from the past,"@TheKuoKnows

This is about as authentic a traditional coffee-shop experience that you will get. No aircons. No frills. Just Bak Kut Teh the old fashioned way.

The portions are very generous. Lots of ribs in the Spare Rib combo. Loved the Liver and Kidey medley too.

A side order of Preserved Vegetables and Stewed Bean Curd won’t go amiss. They help to soften the peppery broth.

This place is very welcoming. Very well done."
The soup is very thick,"Located along Rangoon road. The meat is soft and tasty. The soup is very thick and tasty. A little on the expensive side, but worth the money ."

Worth the walk,"I walked from Lavender and it took me 20 mins to the restaurant. The Ba kut teh is the highlight and other dishes are not bad at all.

I went there in the early morning, so there were no queue. Staffs are friendly and every dish fast prepared."
Tourists Could Visit. Good Pork Rib Soup Also Known As Bak Kut Teh (Locally). Famous People Eat there.,"Review by DrSim001 (zero zero one) (Dr HCM Sim). Tourists Could Visit. Good Pork Rib Soup Also Known As Bak Kut Teh (Locally). No Air-conditioning. Food is Good. Ambience is basic. Service is acceptable, The place Takes you back to Singapore in the 1970s but is a bit cleaner. The road around the restaurant may be dusty and sometimes you get a whiff of rubbish, just like in the Third World Countries. Go in the early morning or brunch or in the have an early dinner. Lunch can be hot. You can see photos of famous people on the wall eg. former Taiwanese President, Actors, Hong Kong Chief Secretary etc. If you order Chinese Tea, there is a gas cylinder stove next to you where you can boil the water for the Chinese Tea. Very traditional and Old School. Follow me on Instagram = drsim001"
Ultra Famous Cafeteria,"Every time I visit Singapore, I am visiting this cafeteria.
I have not been kept waiting because I visit at the time of breakfast.
There are few tourists in breakfast time, and mostly locals.
There is no parking, paste the parking ticket on the windshield and park on the shoulder of a road.
The price is reasonable, but the price is rising little by little as compared with about five years ago.
We paid SGDP 30 by 2 people."
Delicious Ba Kut Teh,I ate this Ba kut Teh at Sentosa Island. I'm not a fan of Ba Kut Teh but I quite like this Ba Kut Teh specially after doing all the activities in Adventure cove Waterpark it's satisfied my hunger. My friends who likes Ba Kut Teh also said it's delicious. The waiter in the Sentosa Island restaurant is also nice. Overall is a nice restaurant.
Best Ba Kut Teh so far,"Personally I do loved Bakut Teh with peppery soup, and found this place match with my taste. During my hunt to search for Bakut Teh, this is the best so far.
Meat was so tender and juicy. The soup was able to be refilled as much as you want. It's worthed to eat here and surely will be back for more."
Won't be going there again,"To be fair, the food was good. The soup is more towards the peppery side and for those who love it to be strong, this is a place for you. Side dishes are the same like other bak kut teh outlets available in Singapore. Overall we do enjoy the food there but if you are wanting to be there close to their closing time, i highly dun recommend to go. There was one male kitchen staff or perhaps cleaner who came to us and ask us whether we are done as he wants to clean our table and lament that they are closing. His tone was not nice and his face is giving us the ""Please leave as soon as you can"" as he was standing around our table. This is what kills off returning guest so i'm boycotting this particular branch at Rangoon. It's not easy to find also as it's quite far in. Good luck."
My favourite BA KU TEH restaurant!,"Have been eating at this restaurant for a long time but have not been back for quite a while. Decided to go back on the weekend. The soup is still good as I have expected which with the You tiao. At the end, always good to go with Kung Fu tea!

"Bak Kut Teh only? Not really, The vege are nice as well","The Bak Kut Teh is very fresh and no strong smell. The veges are very good as well. The only thing is the pepper smell too strong, my cousin kids don't like becoz it's too spicy for them. Unlike Malaysia Bak Kut Teh becuase the soup only content meat and garlic. Yes, no mushroom nor toukee.

I have bring my China cousin to this shop and I can't wait to bring them to try Bukit Mertajam Taste :)"
My Favourite BKT,"This is our favourite Bakuteh restaurant. My family went there twice in the last two months because we liked the peppery pork ribs soup and the many side dishes such as yu tiao, intestines, braised pig trotters. Parking was easy along the main road."
Very good Bak Kut Teh,"Everyone should try Ng Ah Sio, I really really like it 👍🏻 Pork was tender and soup was really delicious. I also had Luo Han Tea, which is not my favourite (because it was sweeter than I expected)."
Very nice Bakuteh,My number 2 pick for the best bakuteh in Singapore. 1st pick is the 365 Balestier Bakuteh. The porky soup is delicious. However the pork is not tender as 365 or even Songfa.
Very Good Pork Rib Soup,"Review by Dr Sim. Very good Pork Rib Soup. Very peppery. Ambience is basic. No air-conditioner. Very famous people (actors, politicians) have patronize the outlet. Their photos are on the wall. Good for tourists to eat there for lunch. A bit warm but you get a feel of the old Singapore. Try the steamed squid as well. Regard Dr Sim"
A must try for Foreigners & Tourists,"Bak-kut-teh is a pork rib dish cooked in broth popularly served in Malaysia and Singapore, & it has been very amongst the Hoklo and Teochew community. Of course, there is a slight different in term ingredients and therefore taste of Bak Kut Teh from Singapore to that of Malaysia. It was the staple diet of substance in the morning back in the colonial days of the bygone era of the British Empire when these Chinese workers came to Malaysia & Singapore as coolies. Bak Tuk Teh has been kept up with time & able to stay updated with the growing affluence of Malaysia & Singapore, & modern days' preference for leaner & better quality of Pork Ribs. This place only opens for lunch & it has become very famous regionally when the 1st Chief Executive Officer of HKG SAR came to S'pore for an official visit and asked for a special dinner arrangement for the entourage, Mr Tung's request was refused! They dont open for dinner for anyone."
Average ba kut teh,"Nowadays bak kut teh has become more and more expensive due to the popularity among tourists. This restaurant is located in Rangoon road, it does not have any aircon, so it will be a bit hot. We have ordered and while everything is being served, they forgotten our pork ribs soup. The portion is small and topping up of soup is slow, soup is also spicy as compared to other restaurant."
Great food,"Best ba kut teh in town simply for the peppery soup based, thick meaty broth. A favorite weekend meal for the family."
Functionality design yet impractical,"Family of 4 visited ng ah sio sentosa last night and we had an unpleasant experience.
We ordered 3 sets instead of 4 cos we won't be able to finish 4 sets.
We were only allowed 3 trays despite asking for additional tray due to the design of the table. It was difficult to balance our rice bowls on the tracks !!!

I understand the policy of tray returned n deposit of $1 and I am willing to put $1 for the additional tray due to the design of the table but was denied

Please spare some thoughts for your customers"
Very nice Pork ribs soup!,"When my friends ask me to join them to this restaurant, I'm not really insterested since bakut teh is not my type of meal.
But after I try those pork ribs soup in this Resto, well.... I have to revise my culinary List.
The soup is so good, very well seasoned, the ribs is not ""smelly"" like most pork cuisine and very tender."
Best Bakut Teh in Town,"My ex-Boss took me here more than 7 years ago. It's been my favorite bakut teh in singapore and always will. During this visit, the taxi driver sway us to try the Legendary Bakut Teh. He mocked us because we coming to Ng Ah Sio, saying bad things. After taste the Legend Bakut Teh and disappointed, we walk to Ng Ah Sio and once again felt satisfied. You MUST TRY"
Good tast for bakut teh,"This is a place for the best bakut teh pork ribs. If you like bakut teh which have strong taste like pepper with ingridient bakut teh soup, this is the place.
If u come from outside singapore and bakut teh lover, it's a must place to come.
I also loved small n big Intestines, quit good too.
Place can only be reach with mrt go to farrer park station and walk 500m or by taxi.
Price is quite expensive for bakut teh in Singapore but it's worth to try for once.
Also this place has no Air Con so if u have lunch with hot weather and hot soup, u will be sweating. They provide a lot of fan but for me it's not a problem at all. But if don't like to eat and sweating. U should consider before u come. I will always come back to this place, everytime i go to singapore."
Soup could be better,"One bowl of youtiao per person is a must. Pig trotters and tofu are fantastic! First serving of soup was blend, only the top-up was better. Too peppery for my liking."
Self service at its best,"My family and I went to the branch at Sentosa at the Festive Walk. We were greeted by three self-ordering machines which were luckily user-friendly and easy to order.

Instructions were not clear though so I left the receipts hanging after payment. Sitting for a while only to realise I needed the receipt to collect orders. Stupid me!

The tables were crafted specially for self-service restaurants and we ate with a tray each. Each tray returned will also refund a SGD1 each.

Price is not too bad but the bah kut teh cannot compare to those in Malaysia. The bah kut teh soup was too peppery, taste like pork pepper soup, unlike herbal soup. However the braised trotter was good. The meat was soft, easily comes off at a prick of the chopsticks and the braise sauce was good enough.

A set with pork ribs bak kut teh, braised trotter and a little bowl of preserved vegetable plus a rive was SGD18.80, the set is good for two persons or even three for a breakfast (with additional rice)

Overall we are satisfied but lack that bak kut teh ""kick""!"
Heavy taste of pork rib soup but expensive,"I tried this few years ago, the pepper taste of the soup is heavier compared with founder pork soup, but more expensive and few meat (and this is not soft enough). You may try once."
Very good soup base,"Ordered a variety of dishes and they arrived swiftly. Quality of food is quite good except that the pork ribs were slightly over cooked. Soup base was the highlight, peppery and flavorsome. Staff refilled without prompting."
Ok place,The pork ribs here are ok. Except I prefer the herbal soup rather than the pepper version which is served here.
Good local food for a quick lunch,"We chose to have lunch here, since it's very convenient to the aquarium, which we had just visited, and we wanted some true local food. This is comparable to a fast food restaurant in the US, but you choose what you want to eat at the entrance, pay for it in a machine, and pick it up with a tray, and when you return your tray, you get S$1 back. We had pork in a delicious broth. It was a quick, easy, and tasty lunch."
Dinner at Rangoon road,"Spicy awesome pork ribs. U can add ur own 'small chilli' as well as garlic to start the engine going. Careful with the portion, it can make you hungry as well as have a tearful ending. Definitely will return for another round."
Good Choice for Bak Kut Teh,"A lot of ppl said this place serves very good bak kut teh (local pork rib soup). Test and tried on 2 occasions. A good choice, but not surprisingly delighted. Thick broth, good fresh meat and liver... Clean and bright though."
Tasty bak-kut-teh,"Super tasty bak kut teh with refilled soup. Other compliment dishes are also very well executed especially the blanch vegetables, tofu. I do like Chinese fried dough when dip into the soup. Ambience is nice & clean. highly recommend!"
Singaporean residing in hk,"I've tried many pork fib soup restaurants and according to my experience Ng Ah Sio is so far the best in taste, freshness of the food and the ambient to have such kind of food. Song Fa and the Founder need to visit this shop and find out the difference. It's not much but THERE IS A DIFFRRENCE."
Teochew style bak-kut-teh,"So this location is close to the Newton Food Centre and is very clean. There are many locations for this chain and is among one of the most famous Bak-Kut-Tehs (pork rib soup) in Singapore.
Their version is more teochew (chiu chow style, on the eastern side of Guangdong province) which is more peppery as compared to the Malay style or Hokkien style which is much more herbal and darker in the broth.
The tern ""teh"" which is teochew for tea is kind of a misnomer nowadays (perhaps the origin of it did use tea leaf), the modern version is really a broth.
We tried different dishes they were quite good but my opinion is there are many places in Singapore that can dish out the Bak-kut-teh just as good."
So so only,"Was here for dinner this evening. Though we ordered most dishes to try. Taste so so, soup not hot and diluted. Not flavorful, soup not hot. Not worth going again."
A good taste of soup,"A friend took us for a brunch to this restaurant, he said here was the best Ba-kut-teh (pork ribs soup). The resto was an old style Chinese resto, the service was fast. A bowl of ba-kut-teh and additional rice and vegetables could be ordered. The soup was good taste and the meat was soft. This resto has been operated for generations, A nice place to have meal with friends."
Interesting but ....,"We had the set meal, about SG$15. It comes with a bowl of pork ribs in soup, a bowl of steamed peanuts and fried tofu in soy sauce, some yu tiao and a bowl of rice. How good is it? Well, this is a substantial meal, given the price and the venue (I was at the Sentosa branch). However, the measure of a good bak kut teh (meat bone tea) is in the soup. The spices that make the soup is what makes the dish. Maybe it is my unsophisticated palate speaking here but the pappery taste overwhelmed the other spice that may have made up the soup. To me, this is a paper and pork rib soup with a dash of soy. Disappointing for some who like their bak kut teh with the traditional taste.
And they also charge a deposit for the tray, which you will need to eat from as the tables were purposely made wonky so bowls cannot sit right on them. This is not a problem, unless you share your meal with someone, then you are one tray short. You get your dollar deposit back when you return the tray. I return trays at hawker stores as a matter of course and I am sure you do the same at McDonald's. In Singaporean food courts,your trays and dirty bowls are taken away by cleaners right after you finished eating. By charging a deposit for the tray, this store is saying they are not providing you with the kind of service you can expect in food courts. Super disappointing."
"Strong taste, original recipe!","We ate here for lunch.
They have strong taste, original recipe for Bakut teh compared to other restaurants.
We ordered quite a lot of varians and I like them all!!!
A must place to go when you come to Singapore.

Here are some of the pictures..."
Very Good!,"I ordered a plate of preserved vegetables, a plate of steamed sotong, a bowl of mee suay and a cup of drink. The food and soup base is pretty tasty. I like the taste of the chilli and blend well with the food. Visited during non-peak hour and the services is good too."
Great Bak Kut Teh,Nice place for local Bak Kut Teh. Like the peppery broth and the well cooked meat. I always get their veggie bowl as well.
Very peppery soup,Service is fast and soup is very peppery as compared to other pork ribs soup. Portion is reasonable.
I thought it wasn't too bad.....,"Previously made by a old uncle who has since sold the business to the big jumbo seafood restaurant chain. .

The bak kut teh is the peppery soup type and it's very peppery. So if you can't take pepper this is not the place for you

The spare ribs is only 2 pieces for a small bowl but the soup is refillable as many times as you want

You can order other accompanying dishes like intestines, cha kueh, peanuts, vegetables etc

To get here take the north east line to farrer park mrt and look for exit I to city Square mall. Once out onto the main street turn right and start walking. It's about a 10-15mins walk."
Good peppery soup,"Always love the pork ribs soup here. Love the peppery soup, and that we can ask for soup refill. Dont order the long ribs, but the signature pork ribs as it is easier to eat for me. I ordered the fried yutiao as usual, but this time taste a bit too oily. Anyway, always love to come back"
Quality has dropped to a level that even instant powdered version in supermarkets taste better.,"I seldom write a thoroughly bad review as people are also running a business, but I pride myself on giving an honest review as much as possible. This place used to be wonderful to come with the family and overseas friends with good bak kut teh soup that is deep and rich in taste and you can feel the time taken to boil the flavourful soup, same goes for the juicy pork ribs. That time has passed, and the commercialization of this place has turned its ugly head away from quality.

The soup tastes like hot water, with barely a hint of the deep flavour of a long boil, the pork ribs are overcooked and taste even drier than the meat used when preparing Cantonese soup (which most throw away as the essence of the meat was used to make the soup and not complement it). It is one of the most unpleasant bak kut teh I have ever eaten, a far cry from several years ago. It tastes even worse than some of the instant packs that I bought and made at home myself from the supermarket. The garlicky content are also sparse and makes the flavour even weaker.

That is not all, even the side dishes are deplorable, the intestines and salted vegetables are not seasoned and prepared as well as before, the soya sauce cooked with the intestines are not done long enough for the flavour to be soaked in and you end up tasting the plain intestines and soya sauce in two distinct tastes, the salted vegetables also lack a lot in taste.

Their service was never good, with grumpy service staff, but least the food was good at that time. Now, this is just an embarrassment to bring my overseas guests to, and a total waste of time and money to make your way here anymore. I hate to sound mean which I rarely do, but I think my readers deserve to use their precious travel time to more worthy establishments."
Standard dropped.,"Visited this location and have business lunch . This place used to be the must eat location many years ago. Now the soup is blend and the meaty taste is no more. Service used to be fast and good, now I can only give a So so for service and quality of food. They have change management of the outlet and not too impress"
Good Bak Kut Teh after Raining (Not the best though),"I've been reading many rave reviews about this place before so I have quite high expectation on this place, especially that I brought two of my traveling buddies here. We were on budgeted trip so we decided to share everything, including food. We ordered one bowl of Signature Spare and Pork Ribs Combo Soup with a bowl of Braised Pig's Intestines and Kung Fu Tea for share.

The soup has a little bit dark color but not the kind like Malaysian Bak Kut Teh that's using more herbs. It is very peppery, which I actually don't mind because I do love pepper. But I found that the ribs were quite plain in taste. And for the soup, aside for being peppery, it didn't taste as great as I expected. I've tasted one which was better somewhere else in Singapore back then.

Surprisingly, the braised pig's intestines tasted really nice. It was seasoned better than the pork ribs.

The price for us is a bit too pricey. But the good thing is we can ask to refill the soup as much as we want without being extra charged. And we came there in a rainy morning, so, it was good to have it in such weather.

The location was by the main road so very easy to spot; the interior was spacious and brightly lit. "
Pork ribs soup,"The soup containing alot of white pepper, this is the typically singapore bakutteh ( porkribs soup), they will serve with the tender pork ribs, normal 2 slave. And the also have other menus like soya sauce egg, tofu, and some vegetables."
Place for Peppery Bak Kut Teh,"There are 3 Bak Kut Teh establishment in Rangoon Road vicinity. This is my preferred because of the unusual peppery soup compared to the normal soup base at most BKT shops. Tender meat that has been cooked for hours comes out of the ribs without effort with less fat. Refillable soup to fill my occasional demand for BKT. But the side dishes lack the quality from earlier times I visited this place. Preserved vegetable that is hard, soft peanuts that look like they came straight out of tin cans. Also must say that the later in the day you visit the shop the more bland and less fiery the soup taste. Make it a point to come before the lunch crowd gathers. After this peppery meal head over two-doors away to Non Entree for some cooling dessert to complete your meal with coffee/tea, ice cream and cakes. Cheers!"
Great beef soup,"My first time in this place, the soup was great and the veal ribs so tender and tasty. I will come back for sure, is a great discovery."
Go for the signature Bak Kuh Teh,Awesome Bak Kuh Teh! Peppery and flavoursome. This would be the most fantastic soup to drink on a cold winter's day as it will definitely warm you up. Still good to have once in a while in Singapore.
Pepper Trades starts from here,Free pepper on the soup Unlimited filling of the soup if you can finish all Local taste bud Not easy on the taste bud and pocket
Strongest pepper taste bak kut teh I have tried,"One of the most well know bak kut teh establishment in Singapore but not my best as I felt the taste has too much pepper. However the tenderness of the ribs is what I will go for.

It has also a good selection of side dishes to accompany the meal."
'Peppery Bak Kut Teh',"This shop serves wonderful pork ribs in peppery herbal soup still piping hot. Other small dishes are pork knuckle, intestine, tripe & tofu, liver, hard boiled eggs and vegetables. Eat together with chopped garlic, chilli & dark soy sauce and a pot of hot chinese tea served in small cups."
Best Bak Kut Teh - Pork rib Soup,"First time to try Bak Kut Teh soup and glad to say this place served a good quality soup with spare ribs/ pork ribs - very tasty, tender meat and balanced spice. I tried blanced peanuts and green veggies as well as small pork intestines. The black sauce on the table is super sweet and tasty - it goes well with all the food they served. They also serve various loose tea that compliments the food - preparation of tea is quite traditional. All in all highly recommended to try if you're in Singapore and would like to try something different."
Where else would you go for Bak Kut Teh?,"One of the most famous place for meat and bone soup in town. Just tried their shop inside food court of Sands.

Delicious soup base and tender meat, must try when you are in Singapore. Either go to the main shop on Rangoon or stay inside Sands mall and you will find it in the food court, same taste.

We tried the internal organs of pig as well, liver, intestines etc, yummy too."
Good food marred by rude cashier,"Food was good, we ordered a large variety of dishes such as spare ribs soup, kidney and liver soup, pigs trotters, vegetables, small intestines.

Service was sufficient for an establishment like this, but had to ask for my soup to be refilled twice although the restaurant was not busy.

When I approached the cashier to pay for the food, I was served by an extremely pissed off and foul looking man in his 50s with a black face and bad attitude. Asked him if my Jumbo membership gave any discounts but was rudely dismissed. Did not even bother to make eye contact or say thank you when he presented me the receipt.

Four stars for the food, and minus one star for the foul looking cashier. Whoever manages this restaurant please consider sacking him. Unpleasant experience."
Would like to eat here more often,"The best bakuteh for me! Friendly and quick service. My favourite dish beside the braised pork ribs are pork trotters and braised pork skin. Best side dish of my son: youtiao. He did also get well along with the pepper in the broth. It's worth to mention, there is a great variety of tea at offer, which can be prepared in the traditional style."
Best Bakkut Teh,I love this bakkut teh very much.. The spicy but refreshing soup is the best for me. the pork ribs are very tender and juicy.. 1 portion is never enough for me..
Good ambience. Too peppery for the kids,So came here with the family at 7am. Would be surprised but it was quite busy. Nice ambience but the soup was pre-cooked and very peppery so kids didn't enjoy as much. Pork ribs is also kinda heavy for daily breakfast. Otherwise things were good.
Average Bak Kut Teh,"Ng Ah Sio BKT was one of of my fav place to have my meal, but 2 weeks ago visited the shop and found the taste have changed and standard drop. Soup is dilute and too spicy, others foods are just average. The dinning environment is good."
I'm almost lost for words,"I was a Bak Kut Teh novice until this place. Now... all I can do is dream of that incredible broth. Seriously outstanding food. The broth is rich and flavoursome while still being incredibly balanced with a good peppery note; the pork spare ribs were tender and delicious. The sides were equally as good; we got the braised peanuts and lettuce, alongside the fried Chinese doughnut.

Many reviews of BKT list Ng Ah Sio as their favourite; this has now become my yardstick to measure others by."
Bar Kut Teh & Pig's innards - Breakfast fit for leaders and head of states?,"Continuing our quest for authentic local delicacies, my wife and I were taken to the iconic hole-in-the wall ' Ng Ah Sio ' for a breakfast of ' Bak Kut Teh' and Chiu Chow yummies. Armed with tablets of Aspirin and Crestor to counter the impending Cholesterol attack, we followed our local foodie guru guide.

Arriving and seeing photos and posters of Asian leaders and heads of states enjoying the hot bowl of spicy meat soup put us in elite company! Once again, we let our local foodie friend do all the ordering and once again he over ordered! Ha! The food he ordered were exotic, delicious and no chance of getting into any health diet guide books!
Just love those tender and chewy pig's intestines, pig's skins and pork hock! As for the star of the meat, the Bak Kut Teh. Initially, the spiciness generated by the use of herbs, spice and peppercorns needs a bit of getting used to, however, after a while, it kind of grows on you.

All in all, a most interesting and filling breakfast. Time to skip lunch and do more walking!!"
All time favorite,"People are always debating on which bah kut teh joint is the best in Singapore.
For me, its definitely Ng Ah Sio. I have been coming here since I was little, long before the shop is sold to the Jumbo group. I was a little skeptic when there was a change in management, but thankfully, they were still as good."
Yummy Ba kut teh,A must visit...! Came there last saturday morning with a hungry belly...went back to the hotel with a happy belly :))
The best Bak Kut Teh in Singapore,I have visited this store many times. I have brought many of my foreign friends and they always love it. A must-try for all visitors to Singapore.
"A unique ""Bak Kut Teh""",The soup make the uniqueness of the bowl of 'Bak Kut Teh'. Go for the signature dish instead of normal as the taste of the pork meat make a great different to it. The price is steep but I feel it worthy for such delicacy.
Some taste,I had lately visited the famous Bak Kut Teh House Ng Ah Sio. I had noticed that the taste had slightly changed. It might be the I visited the shop so early around 08.00. The pepper was not so strong as last year and the pork from the spare ribs was a bit chewish. It could be the it was too early and the soup and meat was not correct.
Shiok Bak Kut Teh,"Took my HK friend there. I think it is a little too spicy for her, because the HK people don't really take very spicy food, and this store is pretty spicy - but I like it!
I used to go to Ah Hwa pork ribs but their standard has deteriorated.

Ng Ah Sio maintains the quality of its pork ribs, the black soya sauce, the pepper and its service staff are impeccable. They top the hot soup continuously. If you don't mind sinful food ""slightly fat pork ribs, lots of innards, high cholesterol"" - this is it!

Parking is very easy along Rangoon Road roadside, usually quite a few lots available, but watch the peak hours though

Admire the many celebrities' photos on the wall, including ministers/actors etc

Only catch is, PAY BY CASH only

Not Halal of course"
Favorite Bak Kut Teh joint in Spore,I think what distinguishes this Bak Kut Teh restaurant from others is their excellent soup. It is really peppery and full of flavour. Everyone has their favorite bakuteh joint but this is my favorite because of the soup.
Pepper loaded pork ribs soup!,"I've always loved coming here with my family to have BKT, the environment is relaxing and inviting.. Rather traditional looking.. Adding to the feels of dining in Ng Ah Sio. Can't emphasize enough on how peppery the soup is! I love it but at times I feel like it can be way too overpowering, I can't really taste the pork broth. But nonetheless it's still very shiok! Meat is a little tough.. Will be perfect if it's softer.. But I don't know, maybe being tougher is the way it's supposed to be. We'll always order the braised tau pok and sotong to go along with the BKT too. Good choice for late dinner too. Another tip, better to drive or take a taxi there."
Way over rated,"Environment is reasonable, not luxurious, but clean. Food price is on high side. Taste of food, any already wonder why so many people, any Bak Kut Teh food store in coffee is equally good, if not, better. Wouldn't be bothered to drive here again"
highly recommended for those who love peppery soup,"it has been quite sometimes since i last visited this place.... the soup is still very very good , since i like peppery soup.
the pork ribs and the pork kidney are very fresh....
combined with fried dough and traditional chinese tea, it is so refreshing, a good hearty breakfast...
However, this place is quite secluded, it is a bit hard to catch a taxi back

for children be ware of the hot tea kettle"
Ready for Peppery bak kut teh soup anytime ! Super tasty,"I love peppery soup , Ng ah sio serves one of the best BKT Soup in sg. I found the meat a bit tough but otherwise it's all good. All the other dishes were great and the decor and set up was v oriental and lovely."
Best taste,Pork ribs soup is perfect taste. Beautiful taste for vegetable lettuce. This is the best Buk Kut Teh in Singapore.
Singapore Style Pork Ribs Soup,Singapore Style Pork Ribs Soup is Teochew Style where is more peppery but the soup is clear. This is unlike the Cantonese Style in Malaysia where the soup is not clear
Nice quaint restaurant,"The soup very peppery. The set meal was worth it. It came with a bowl of rice, soup, an egg, a bowl of vegetables and a dish of tau kua and tau pok."
Famous bak Kut teh lives up to its reputation!,"Heads of state and tycoons have all been known to pay homage to this institution of Singapore "" Eating House"" aka "" coffee shop"" cuisine. The pork ribs were meatier and not too fatty as opposed to the pork bones version. Same soup- peppery and fortifying with spices. You could have rice or Mee sua to go with the ribs. I still prefer plain rice so I could put more of the soya sauce on top. Oh yes, the thick, unctuous dark soya sauce comes in 2 versions: sweet and plain (savoury). I like the sweet version more. Lo Han Guo drink soothed the fiery throat nicely. Will come again definitely."
One of the Best Bak Kut Teh,One of the best Bak Kut Teh (Pork Ribs Soup) in Singapore. It has a very strong taste of white and black pepper. It is located 10-15 minutes by taxi from Orchard Road. The restaurant close on every Monday
BEST bak kut teh in TOWN!,"I'm a bak kut teh fan, and i've tried a lot of bak kut teh over the past 16 years. I always come back here. It was a lot more localised, before Jumbo Seafood brought over this place, nevertheless, the taste is not compromised. BIG TIPS: you must paired the bak kut teh with ""xiao ye gan"" chinese tea. After you drink the tea, it will leave a sweet taste in your mouth, then you eat again the spare ribs pork, and that's just flying to the cloud nine for me...
downside, it's quite hot inside, especially with the construction of the MRT just beside the restaurant, it feels kinda dark..but it's tolerable for the taste of the best bak kut teh"
Good Bak Kut Teh!,Good food and nice place to have a gathering with friends and family or bring friends from out of town to taste this famous Bak Kut teh. Do call for reservations as this shop is quite popular. Highly recommended.
The Best Bak Kut Teh in Town!,"I have tried many Bak Kut Teh stalls around town, some are those who some says are the best but fall short of my standards. I can confidently say that this one is best one!

I have preferred the peppery-garlicky type of broth for bak kut teh, and so I find that this one is the best I have tasted after trying out many other bak kut teh shops. The broth is not salty, and also not bland. It is just right. Very flavorful and well seasoned. I think it is a bit more peppery than usual (which I prefer) but i find it just right and not overpowering the taste of the meat but rather enhances it. They got options for the prime rib or soft bone, or both. Prices vary depending on which type of meat you are getting. I have tried the mixed rib and soft-bone, and both are very nice and tender, and very meaty for a rib! Soups are re-filled for free.

You can have an option to sit indoors or outdoors (but we sat indoors). I am not so sure if it is airconditioned or not (I think it is) because we are sweating because of the hot and peppery soup we are sipping. ^_^

Prices are quite reasonable for the quality of the food that they serve. Staff are friendly.

The only thing that is not so good is that the venue is far from MRT. I am not sure also if there are buses going there. But it surely is worth the travel if you are taking a cab. Bringing your own car is a bit of a challenge too to find a good parking space in the area."
Best pork ribs bakuteh in town,Get the signature pork ribs bakuteh. U wont regret. The lettuce side dish also fresh n crispy. Forget the kungfu tea.... just a normal tea if u dont like to drink one. Nothing special. But in overall... awesome place to eat
