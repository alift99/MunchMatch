Perfect birthday!,"Everything was perfect! We loved our time here. The food was excellent and the service was wonderful. Thank you to Lenny for the wonderful service and to the wonderful sommelier? From turkey, you all made my birthday one to remember!"
Dinner,Had a lovely time having dinner here. Food exceeded expectations and service was very pleasant. Special compliments to Sheryll for her kind recommendations and polite service towards me and my partner. Would definitely be coming back here again.
Delightful meal and view,We first saw 1-Atico on TV and wondered if it was as good in reality. We didn't know where it is but chanced upon it. Thank you for working on a public holiday so that we could enjoy ourselves!
Birthday lunch,"A surprise birthday lunch from my missus saw us visit Attico - Flnt which was located on Level 55 at Ion Orchard. Entry was made possible through a set of lifts located on level 4 (having to walk through what used to be the art gallery).

Alighting from the lift immediately saw ceiling to floor window view of the skyline. Although the reception counter was vacant, someone eventually attended to us and shows us to our table. As we took our seats, I drew in the sprawling views of some of the high rise residential buildings and landed enclaves in the Orchard area.

The service staff came to take our orders promptly. A quick decision was made upon our choice - lunch set which saw us gravitate to our favourite dish in any Japanese kitchen restaurant - Bara Chirashi for our mains.

Presentation of the dish was mesmerising with eye popping colours. The usual richness in umami flavours which we gave grown accustomed to saw a refreshing change. Our dish saw an interesting interpretation where ingredients of capsicum, cherry tomatoes and roasted corn gave it a zesty tanginess.

Thanks to Lenny for the service and in helping us with the beautiful photos."
Excellent Food and service,"We had the $168 tasting menu for dinner. Good portion was good, presentation beautiful and taste was yummy! All of us enjoyed. The service of Sheryll is excellent! We enjoyed this family diner very much.
The Yu Sheng is so unique and generous with sashimi and caviar! Must try!"
FLNT,"Love the ambiance with amazing views, great service (Sheryll) and enjoyed the Peruvian Japanese food selection! Reasonable price for the experience. Looking forward to trying Fire (connected) in a next trip."

You must come to this restaurant,"From beginning to the end, the service was impeccable under leadership of Haydel. The staff was attentive without being intrusive, warm without being over familiar.

"Great food, great service",Excellent service and food!

Birthday Celebeation,"Came here for birthday celebration. The service staff, Kavin and the manager were very observant (gave me a cushion for my back) and helpful. Very good service! :)"
FLNT Good Service,"Good service by Sheryll, the food is quite nice too~ but don‚Äôt expect Michelin Japanese food~ nice for celebrations"
OverPriced and Worse if not for the View,"Had lunch at this up market Jap/Peruvian restaurant and ordered the set lunch of Spiced Peruvian Chicken wrap that came with a pathetic 2 palm sized wrap with tiny bits of chicken in some skewer. The seasonal fruit starter featured 3 measly slices of strawberry and the soup that was claimed to be corn miso tasted more like corn soup from your Campbell can, argh. totally unsavoury and lacks class for a restaurant of such standing in the heart of Singapore's shopping belt. Would have gone to some kebab joint at some street vendor and gotten chunkier pieces of meat with better sides and dressing!! Only saving grace was the view offered. Wouldn't ever return again."
AWESOME,Awesome service given by Ms Sheryll Very attentive very sensitive and she give us good recommendations on the food. We were given seats by window with Super nice view!!! Will Definitely be back!!!! ‚ù§
Amazing food and view,"Our waiter for the night was nothing short of fabulous, he was a so pleasant and could not do anything more for us. He was always close by and every so willing to assist."
Dinner at Flnt,"Food fantastic great view with window seats. Was served by Kavin, very friendly, always looking out if we need anything, knowledge of all the food and will tell you about the food every time he served. Great personality!"
Good dinning experience,"We try the food tasting menu and our experience with the good with various dishes. They are tastefully done and well presented. The waiter and waitress were helpful in explaining each dish and help us appreciate the good better. The ambiance is great and cosy for dinner. The only problem is finding a car parking lot at 7pm, it took us 25-30 min to finally find a car park. Suggest valet service be available to aboid this problem"
Great service!,"Chose to visit FLNT for the great view and in celebration of my mum's birthday. Food was not spectacular but service rendered by Sheryll was superb. She was attentive and accommodating to our requests. Thanks to her, we had spent a good time at FLNT yesterday."
Thursday Lunch,"- Ambience is good - View is amazing, even from the restroom - Service crews are friendly - Food presentation is very good - Food quality is amazing"
Good view good food good service,"Great view and exceptional service from Sheryll
She waited on us with patiences, was very friendly, and candid ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I loved my Yasai Don however I do hope that the capsicum could have been julienned instead of being served as a ‚Äústeak‚Äù whole piece of a capsicum.

Loved the view, our waiter did recommend sunset time 6-6.30pm,
Would definitely be back here"
Dinner,"My wife surprised me with a birthday dinner. Great ambience, great view and exceptional service by our waitress, Sheryll."
Good food,Nice ambience n friendly service by Sheryll:) we love all the food here and we return for visit again.
Beyond Expectation,"This was our anniversary celebration and with our new addition of family member. Staff were friendly and helpful to support our needs on the baby. The environment was lively, tasting menu full of surprise and some dishes were beyond our expectation such as the starter and scallop.

Our waiter was Kavin and he provided an excellent service with attention to details. Our meal were delayed mid-way due to busy kitchen, Kavin kept us updated and apologised sincerely. In the end we got our drinks waived due to delay of services which was surprising but satisfied. Overall, if I visit Singapore again I will definitely come again."

Good Review,"Hi, I would like to praise your staff, Kavin for his great service. He is very attentive and provided a great service. The food was also good and tasty. Would recommend family and friends to come over to try too."
Nice but not great as expected.,"Delicious food and presentation with excellent service by Vivian but‚Ä¶
we had requested a window as it was our 25th wedding anniversary and we were given one but it was at one end with only a partial view - 50% of my view was looking at frosted glass, the other at the darker backblocks of Singapore.
The other thing was the lighting was so bright in such a large cavernous space it was like sitting in a cheap cafe looking at more of a reflection of the lights in the glass rather than the view so no points for view or ambience.
We expected it to be $$$, not a problem with that, but given the wine was about $150 up a bottle and the evening over $400, we would not return for the same experience."
Birthday celebration.,Good food with nice view. Repeated customer. Was there again to celebrate a friend's belated birthday. Must try their grilled cod. My favourite üòã
Decent food and experience.,"Decent dining experience. The Ibero pork and miso cod were decent. Staff were friendly, shoutout to Heydel for his excellent hospitality and service."
Great service,"Celebrated my friend birthday and the waitress Leny prepared a small cake and candle for her! She made sure we r fine and everything is ok, thank you for great service, we ll be back!"
Impressive!,"We were there for a birthday celebration. The 55th floor view, the attentive services and of course the creative and awesome food made the dining experience so memorable.

We actually found the portions generous. Ordered the grilled squid and white corn under ‚ÄòSmall Plates‚Äô and the grilled lamb and miso cod to share. The squid was beautifully done, grilled to tender perfection. We enjoyed the sweetness and crunchiness of the corn too.

The grilled lamb was full-flavoured, juicy and tender. There were 4 pcs of smokey lamb in the serving. The cod was fresh, lightly crisp and does not taste overly ‚Äúfishy‚Äù, in fact it was bursting with flavours. It‚Äôs plating and presentation was also awesome.

We ordered desserts from the Fire menu which was more extensive than what were available from Flnt. Lovely presentation and definitely worth the calories!

Our appreciation to Kelvin, he was extremely prompt and attentive, he knows the restaurant‚Äôs products well and very proactive. He helped to sort out a minor mistake in the bill and rectified it swiftly."
Amazing,"Food was really good, best dishes are the white corn, sushi rice and chocolate mousse. Amazing atmosphere"
very good,"good ambience, breathtaking view, excellent service, very delicious. we ordered the tasting menu and it was just nice"
"Expansive view, worth a visit at least!","Everyone from the reception to the waitstaff were really lovely and welcoming. The lunch set was reasonably priced for the expansive view and experience. The chirashi was so colourful and pretty, different from the usual ones we get at traditional Japanese restaurants."
Excellent food and service,"Great ambience, excellent food and awesome service. View of the restaurant was outstanding and we enjoyed our experience thoroughly."
Amazing restaurant!,"Awesome food, view and hospitality.
We had a set menu which was extraordinary and extremely tasty, especially the sashimi! Like, WOW!

The city view from the high floor was very distinctive! If only the brightness of the room could be less, will be more perfect!

The hospitality was exceptional. Thank you Lenny, Suyee, and team!

Overall, 9 out of 10!"
Fabulous Service and Food,"We were well taken care by Farliani and Lenny.

The food was delectable with nice view of the orchard scenery.

Both Farliani and Lenny took initiative to help us take photos knowing it‚Äôs a special occasion.

Strong recommended!"
Awesome experience,"The service staff was very attentive and friendly to customer. Food quality was good, fresh and tasty. Lenni attended to us and was immaculate."
Team dinner,"Food was alright but nothing to wow about. Sashimi was fresh. Our main course took more than 30min to serve as kitchen was short handed and with new staff. Service was very good, especially Lenny & Heydel offered snacks and drinks while waiting for our food. They apologised sincerely and we ended our night with nice coffee & tea. Great recovery & effort by service staff"
Fantastic food,Nice view and fantastic food. Reasonably priced. Serviced by Lenny was a bliss. Had a free piece of birthday cake which is surprisingly good.
Nice view and food,Excelent food! Very quick service and perfect view once you are on the 55th floor. The kitchen closes at 8.30 pm so it‚Äôs better if you go early !
Japanese Lunch at lvl 55 ION,"The food is lovely with the freshest of sashimi and black Cod. Service is also tip top. However, had problem paying the bill as I forgot to bring my credit cards. They also do not accept cash or PayLah! or Paynow. Suggest outlet look into this financial aspect. Special thanks to Emma for solving my problem"
Great food and view,"Absolutely fantastic food, cozy ambience and the view is spectacular! Thank you Ms. Aiza for your kind hospitality. Will definitely come back for another visit!"
Stunning view and food to match!,An unforgettable sunset view for a romantic evening! At the same time enjoying unique Peruvian Japanese cuisines. Our two starters included raw dishes: octopus ceviche and warm tuna sushi and a side dish of Peruvian spiced marinated grilled chicken. The main dishes were grilled Spanish pork and grilled lamb rack. Completed our delightful meal with chocolate ice cream. Total cost with one bottle of wine and 2 aperitifs; S$467

Especially the girl who served my table, very prompt
Great experience and worth every penny i paid."
Fab views. Good food. Average service.,I had made a reservation for lunch for 2 pax. We were punctual and were escorted to our window side table with amazing views. The decor is really nice and the place looks awesome because of the tall floor to ceiling glass windows. Service could be better to be honest for a place of such opulence. The food was quite good and well presented. I liked the flavours and the lunch options on the menu are quite good in terms of price and quantity. I would love to dine here over dinner and see how amazing the views are. Would be nice to try some alcohol too.
Good food and scenery,Amazing scenery. Food was good. Ordered the cod and lamb as well as grilled squid. The sauce for the cod was great and the softness just nice. Great prompt service too (sorry could not remember her name ).
Perfect Date with Stunning View,"Celebrated our anniversary here, and everything is perfect! Not only the view is stunning, the food is lovely and most importantly, the impeccable service. We had a memorable date and thanks to the hospitable team for making it happen :)"
Compliments,"Awesome view with awesome service and food! Special thanks to Vivian and Fafa!
Vivian is the friendliest service staff I‚Äôve ever met. She volunteered to take nice pictures for us and always so polite and attentive. Fafa is the most observant and hands on manager I‚Äôve ever met. I dropped my chopsticks and she immediately came over with a new one without me asking. I also observed that She walks to almost all the tables to ensure all is good. She volunteered to bring us around the area when we asked about the place. Food was amazing! The chef took pride in the plating and we love the taste of every dish. It was an amazing experience and I‚Äôll be back soon. Well done FLNT and team!"
A WOW Restaurant!,"Starting from the view (55th floor of Ion Sky), the friendly service, the cocktails and of course the food! For cocktails, must try the Peruvian Pisco Sour (that‚Äôs the grape alcohol with egg white, lemon juice & syrup) and the Kukishoku (that‚Äôs pisco with melon liqueur, citrus juice, yuzu foam and honey syrup). The tasting menu at S$128++ is amazing! Consisting fresh sashimi, octopus ceviche, foie gras with grilled sweet corn, grilled cod, and grilled lamb rack, finished by flamed seared salmon with salmon roe. Complemented with Japanese ice cream. An extraordinary experience!"

The other waiter Robin is also quite a cheerful and friendly staff in the restaurant ."
Fabulous meal for a special occasion,"Great food and service with a beautiful view. It was my second meal at FLNT and it was just as great as the first time I was there shorty after the opening. Every dish was unique, balanced in flavour, and I loved all the fun textures. The service was great too. I mentioned it was for a birthday celebration, and they kindly offered a lovely slice of cake. Looking forward to be back again!

The cod was my absolute favourite dish, and the fried white shrimp were such a nice snack!"

55th floor meal and the staff service is amazing and homely.,Got to know about this place from my wife when we had our wedding anniversary there. First time having a meal at 55th floor.
