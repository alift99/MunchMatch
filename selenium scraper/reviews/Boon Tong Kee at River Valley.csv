"Half a roast, half a boiled","Three of us but had an appetite for half a roasted and half a boiled chicken. Good proportions and served together with the rice n veg.

Excellent succulentness with the sauce over the top. He roasted, being roasted not so moist but robust skin was a texture.

Very good for the chicken rice as well as the other excellent dishes they do."
Comfort food for such trying times,"Comfort food for such trying times. The chicken, rice and sauces are very good of course. They have other nice dishes as well - tofu, sweet sour pork, seafood in yam bowl etc."
Chicken Rice!,"Been recommended by my Singapore customer as one of the best Chicken Rice in Singapore. It's tasty, love local street food atmosphere."
Famed for one of Singapore’s best Chicken Rice - you’ll not be disappointed.,"Obviously this outlet has been in this place for a very long time, & this operation accordingly works like a finely tuned machine..rapido table delivery by old hands that’ve been in service for yonks makes not for a relaxed dinner..but it’s how serious Cantonese Chicken Rice lovers like it!
We started with just a half ( generous serve) Chicken, though I personally found the (needing to be separately ordered) Chicken Rice tasty but too richly flavored - so my choice of plain steamed rice a better foil for the succulent meat we certainly enjoyed hugely.
We unwisely added a exotic serve of French beans w Spinach & Prawns in XO sauce - it was a bit over the top at a pricey $24 for a place like this......so stick to basics & traditional value stays in place ...but make no mistake... we ate the lot! Delicious!"
Food are great but Parking is a problem,My 2nd visit to this outlet because the parking is inconvenient. Food is above average however there are better Chicken rice elsewhere.
Overrated restaurant - nothing special anymore,"This restaurant is overrated in all areas - quality, pricing, portion size, etc. This used to serve really good chicken rice. Not anymore!! Now it seems more focused on making a buck than on the quality of their food. The skin of steamed chicken tasted awful ... like it was from an old batch ie probably cooked too early in the morning - we were there at 1pm. The rice portion size was small and pathetic and lacked the fragrance and taste of the traditional/original Boon Tong Kee famous chicken rice. They charged you $5 for a small single portion of chicken. And then charged you separately an additional $1 for a loosely packed triangle of rice. Plain water $1...what a joke. Daylight robbery. I can see that they are now more focused on the China tourists as there were lot of such tourists arriving on SUVs. It is no longer our local Boon Tong Kee chicken rice which used to be frequented by locals and taxi drivers, when it was run by the old owners. Pity the philosophy and skills were not passed onto to the younger generation."
Overpriced tourist trap-not what it was,"I used to live very close to the restaurant and visited often for the famous chicken rice. It is sad to see how far the standard has dropped.
The service was unfriendly. They no longer sell chicken rice sets. They sell chicken as one dish and rice as another, just to charge more.
The food used to get special-now it's only average.
They seem only to cater for foreign tourist groups who will never eat there again.
Well, I won't be eating there again."
Great Chicken and Rice,A quick lunch stop for some of the best chicken and rice in Singapore. Steamed chicken was good and Roasted chicken was even tastier.
Chicken Rice Dinner,"So so at this branch. We were attracted to the Boon Tong Kee chicken rice after having our mother day dinner at their Ang Mo Kio branch. Somehow when we try it out at this branch, it was not so tasty. The ambience is pretty ""haunting""....waitresses NOT friendly at all.
Personally will not be back."
Not like it used to be,"Have not eaten Boon Tong Kee's chicken rice for quite sometime, so decided to try it.

I was disappointed with my meal. Both the chicken meat as well as the chicken rice were not as fragrant nor as tasty as they used to be. And, they no longer give you any accompanying soup with your order.

Good thing is that there are many other food besides chicken rice you could offer. Deep fried tofu was nice, but the greenish mayonnaise sauce was, I feel, not the appropriate sauce or dip for it.

Overall, a disappointing meal."
Good and consistent,"Always reliable for good chicken rice - chicken, rice and chilli. Other good dishes as well, especially for large group. This branch is small, so if there’s 10 of you, balestier main branch is better"
Brilliant dinner,"Recommended by front desk manager, walked 450 mtrs & from moment of the first bite to the last, it was delicious. Chicken rice and pork ribs Zen Jiang sauce. Will be back"
Chicken was average but the rice was really tasty,"We went to this restaurant because we were told that the chicken rice was really good. Besides ordering the chicken rice we ordered a plate of steamed brocolli and had carrots and baby corn. When I went to eat the brocolli, there was a bad smell, like the veggies had gone off and another one in our group tried another piece of the vegetables and she too could smell that the vegetables were off and tasted off. We left the entire plate untouched.
When we told the restaurant staff they blamed us and said that we were just not used to the smell and taste of the vegetables that came out of the can. We were only doing them a favour and alert them to their off vegetables and instead of kindly accepting the feedback they blamed our tastebuds. We didn't even ask for our money back, we just wanted them to know so they don't continue to serve vegetables that were not fresh."
my favorite chicken rice,"the chicken rice here never fails, they try to be different from the original branch at Balestier by having their rice in the shape of a pyramid, they also have green tea mayonaise for their crispy fried tofu..

this place always a delight to go to, my go to chicken rice."
Delicious meal,"The best chicken around, soft and juicy goes perfect with the chilli sauce and hot rice. Side of vegetable and soup is a good set to purchase"
Tasty tasty and a bit pricy,"Always good, chicken rice done well with all the trimmings. Lime juice. XO beans and both a half of crispy and steamed chicken over tasty rice. Always fresh, and lime juice is so tasty....."
Very Good Chicken Rice!,"Along the years, the taste of the Boon Tong Kee has remained consistent. The service is very homely and ambiance has changed for the new era look. Chicken rice and the chicken are mouthwatering. Fried Tofu is a good try! For other dishes, maybe half dish concept can be introduced for people going alone, since those portions are too much for one person and end up wasting. There are some other good places for Chicken Rice but Boon Tong Kee is worth a visit for all travelers going to Singapore."
Great chicken rice,"We went there with my 1.5 year old son, and there's not only a high chair for him, also a set of cutlery which is very thoughtful.

We love the chicken rice and deep fried prawn roll (can't remember the exact name on the menu)

The only thing that we don't like is the traffic there, yellow line in front of the restaurant and we had to walk far away to get a taxi~ but I think it not the restaurants fault...It just a shame that we couldn't go back everyday during our trip because it's inconvenient to us"
Fried tofu is my fav here,"Chicken rice! I am a chicken rice lover.

Rice is good but chicken is not better than the chicken next door. Can I mix Boon Tong Kee’s rice with next door “5 Star”’s chicken?

Anyways I can finish half chicken plus 2 bowls of rice for lunch!

Try their fried tofu, you would love it!"
GREAT Chicken !!!,"My friend and I went to Boon Tong Kee to order some take-out for my family. We went all the way from Marina Bay Sands hotel to the restaurant because we heard how good the chicken was...and they didn't disappoint us. I think I went a little over-board on ordering the chickens (I purchased 4 of them -- we were hungry when we ordered :) We were able to finish about 2 of them and gave the rest to our friend since we were staying in the hotel and didn't have a refrigerator). He gave some to his friends and they finished all the food (whew...)

The food was FANTASTIC as Chinese food goes...the chicken was tender and perfectly cooked...the veggies were right on too...it was just great Chinese food (after staying at several hotels in Singapore...and eating Western food...this food was probably one of the best meal I had while I was in Singapore)

We kept asking the chefs if they could give us more pickled veggies...they gave us a lot...and it was really good with the rice and chicken."
Forced to eat this,We went there because we got out of the airport late so it was the only place that’s open and i regretted doing so because the taste was worse than the one in my city which was disappointing and it made my throat feel bad because of a lot of msg
Chicken Rice,Part of Boon Tong Kee chain. Quality is not consistent. Give it a miss and head to the one at Balestier Road
"Ok food, atrocious service (Rating: 3/5)","A guest was in town and she was keen to try Singapore’s “famous chicken rice” when she spotted Boon Tong Kee at River Valley Road.

Upon entering the eatery, we were told to wait for a table since we were unwilling to share one, especially since we had plans to hold a private conversation over dinner. Not a single one of the many staff standing around invited us to take a seat at the numerous empty tables meant for larger groups as we waited. I was observing them to see if anyone would take the initiative. Alas, nobody did. Soon, tired of standing near the entrance, I simply plonked myself at a table next to me, and invited my guest to follow suit.

For the two of us, I ordered half a chicken, fried French beans in spicy “XO sauce”, deep fried prawn rolls, and accompanying chicken rice and lime juice.

There were more than enough succulent pieces of chicken to be relished, and the deep fried prawn rolls dipped in a dark sweet sauce were simply delicious. However, the dish of fried French beans was mediocre and its plating and presentation was rather haphazard and unimpressive (considering we were not at a food court or hawker centre).

It was a nice dinner for two that cost just under SGD60/£33/USD46. But I am giving a rating of 3/5 as service was atrocious."
A recommended restaurant,We had been here some years ago and wanted to go back and try Hainan Chicken with Pyramid shaped rice. Yo this we had fried pork ribs and vegetables. Drinks were Chinese tea. Good tastes in good company. We will come back.
Reliable,"Always 1 of the go-to places for chicken rice, or singapore food for that matter. This location is more central than the other ones. But come early or late, peak meal times are a pain to queue

The elderly female staff are friendly and quite the hoot

Food is alright - chicken rice, vegetables, fried tofu etc. Ok at $25 per person"
Singapore - Chicken rice,"Sometimes after all the fine dining you need some good old comfort food and you get it no where else but Boon Tong Kee. Love the tender white chicken here, aromatic rice and awesome chilli!"
Delicious chicken rice. Would come again,"I wanted to try the chicken rice at this restaurant chain so dragged my husband to the River Valley restaurant. We ordered the half Hainanese chicken with two bowls of rice, the Kang Kong and a French Bean and Scallop dish. I was really happy with all the dishes and would each at the restaurant again next time I go to Singapore. The chicken was tender and tasty and the bean and scallop dish was fresh and crunchy. The scallop dish was a bit on the pricier side and we paid a bit more than what we would have if we went to a Hawker store but I would recommend it."
Great Chicken Rice joint,A very popular chicken rice place which has queues all the time. One of the best chicken rice place although the other dishes are average. The SGD 5 takeaway Chicken rice is the best deal ever.
Average chicken rice but not the service.,"Average chicken rice, I went there just because my friend love their chicken rice but not me.

Been there twice and not really like that place now. An incident that I wanted to take tablets when I finished my meal and I ask for a glass of warm water to go with it, and didn’t know I got charged at S$1 when I paid the bill. The staff need to be re-train on how to inform your guest that everything you ask for is chargeable. And honestly I didn’t expect that.

Secondly, I don’t think it’s hygiene to put the peanuts on the table and re-use it again when the guest left (saw them doing it). Again, they like to put the peanut on the table and if you consumed even just a piece, they will charge it to your bill quietly without letting you know the price. Same thing they do it for wet tissue. Haha

Overall, this is just my comment towards the restaurant. I will still go back if my friend wanna too. Definitely not my choice of place."
Good local food,Food is fairly simple but very tasty. I visited very often cause it close to where we stayed. Their Chicken Rice is very famous they have have lunch ‘set’ portion for takeaway. They always have long que during lunch/dinner hour. Recommend if you are near by.
Best place for chicken rice,"The great part is it's open till late, so its perfect after a night out and you need some good food. Their extensive menu doesn't limit you to only chicken rice. So its fabulous. The service is great and quality never disappoints. Its a landmark on its own."
Great Hainanese Chicken Rice,"Visited this place for late lunch on a Wednesday and had the half chicken with chicken rice. It was very delicious! One of the best chicken rice I have eaten during my visit. The chicken was steamed nicely, soft and succulent and the rice was fragrant and tasty."
Good food,This place had good food but just not we were expecting. We had heard so much about Singapore’s famous chicken rice BUT the chicken is cold with little flavour. The spare ribs were yummy and the deep fried tofu was absolutely divine. Service was very friendly and quick. Would recommend for the experience.
Nice but sitting space a bit cramp,"Not crowded during lunch time on weekday. Services were good but find the sitting space a bit cramp. If u go with kids/baby, best is to sit near the entrance. Food served in small portion. Can't order much because of the small table. Overall experience is good."
Best spot for local Sing food!!,Great spot for Chicken rice! It's a basic spot with great local food. A must eat at spot... when you're in Singpore!
Got my chicken rice fix! Must eat,"Been to the other chicken rice places mostly at food courts and this is THE CHICKEN RICE to have. The rice is tasty and the chicken cuts are extremely fat and juicy.

We were three hungry tourists and we happily wolfed down the entire chicken. Overall I was happy to get my chicken rice fix here."
My favorite chicken rice,"I like to come to the River Valley branch because of the location, decor and the service. This is the usual place I bring overseas friends to taste one of Singapore’s most iconic dishes.

I love to order the steamed chicken which served in chunky pieces and it’s smooth and tender. The fragrant rice goes with the chili is extreme savory.

This is my favorite chicken rice"
Great food in a local restaurant,"Apparently this restaurant has been around for many years, but it looks like many other small Singaporean restaurants. We had to wait a bit to get a seat, as it is quite popular, but the wait was only a few minutes. We thoroughly enjoyed the excellent food, including great chicken rice and a lovely prawn dish. We also enjoyed a dish with green beans and scallops, although this was a little overpriced, I felt. I enjoyed having my rice served in a pyramidal shape (betraying my mathematical roots!). Staff were competent, friendly and attentive, without being overwhelming. A good place for a meal."
Nice chicken rice,"Very good chicken rice here. 10 minutes of queuing at this place really worth the wait. Fast service and delicious chicken rice. I love the ngo hiang or fried shrimp rolls here, very tasty. The double boiled chicken soup also not bad."
"Open Till Late, Tourist Friendly","As I need to dine past dinner time, it gets more and more challenging to find nice good eat. Boon tong kee is one of the few that actually serves great food till late. If you're a tourist I would strongly suggest that you do all your shopping in the day and when the shop closes, head to this place and have the famous chicken rice.

I ordered something out of the ordinary which is the sweet and sour pork and it was served instantly. Though the portion of the rice on the chicken rice set is rather small.

As for myself, I have always preferred Kampong chicken which is a much leaner meat but Boon Tong Kee would be the more well known name for the majority of the population. Service was good.

One of the best restaurants in Singapore.

The staffs speaks English, Mandarin and Cantonese."
Doesn't disappoint,"@TheKuoKnows

Boon Tong Kee is one of the go-to place for Hainanese Chicken Rice in Singapore. With almost 40 years of experience, it should know how to boil a chicken expertly. And it does.

The silky texture of the chicken is a testament of its years of experience. Half a chicken only costs $13. It's enough for three or, maybe, four diners.

But there's more to BTK than just Chicken Rice. The Pork Ribs are a delight. And for the health-conscious, the Deep Fried Beancurd is cooked to perfection.

But healthy eating can come at a price - the Stir Fried Kai Lan, which is superb, costs $12 a portion.

Boon Tong Kee is just one of many Hainanese Chicken Rice eateries in Singapore. It shouldn't disappoint. And it doesn't."
Dinner without Chicken !!,"Decided to have dinner at Boon Tong Kee but decide not to order chicken dish.

My Husband was craving to have the chicken RICE - Rice ! We decided to order
2 dishes. The Sambal Kang Kong and the seafood Claypot Toufu.

Sad to say both dishes were very salty!

Informed the staff of Boon Tong Kee about
Both dishes . I must say, they are well trained in this!!! They offered immediately to have both dishes replaced without any further question !! Impressive ."
Very tasty chicken rice,This restaurant is famous for its chicken rice and indeed is delicious. We ate a tasted chicken and a hainanese chicken rice and a vegetable soup with salty eggs. Everything was tasty. Service was friendly and extremely fast. The restaurant quite nice.
A Great and Typical Chinese Singaporean Restaurant,"This is quite an established Chinese Singaporean Restaurant. The dishes are quite typical of a Chinses Singaporean or Chinese Malaysian chef. I particularly like the steamed chicken and the chicken rice. The vegetable dish, Kang Kong, is also my favorite. Another popular dish is Deep Fried Prawn Rolls. I have not tried their Fried Chicken so far but they looked good to me. I noticed that there were 10 waiters/waitresses in that small restaurant and the service was really fast.
There was always a queue on a weekend or public holiday eve. This is quite typical of a good Singaporean restaurant. Once you finish your food, you don't feel good to continue to occupy the table."
Way Overpriced,"I ate here with my family,the chicken rice was average,the sweet and sour pork was OK.

Our table was near the street,someone outside was smoking which blew in to our table.

For a similar price I can eat at the Ritz Carlton and get far better service and superior food."
Better to go to the flagship @Balestier,"Had dinner with a large group of 8 recently.
Chicken rice good, if not outstanding and the other dishes a little bit on the small size, portion wise.
Tried the prawn toast which was good.
Recommend to go to Balestier shop as I think the dishes got more flavour there, although this shop is close to Orchard Road and is around 20 minute good walk to junction between Orchard and Scotts Road after dining there!

Expensive by local standards, but tourists keep flocking there!"
Great chicken rice,Located about 1 km from ion orchard Great chicken rice Service was OK Worth to visit while in Singapore
Excellent,"On the day, we were not that hungry so we did not order a lot. We had tried the fried tofu, Hai Nan Chicken rice and lime juice. I loved the portion sizes because it was very fair and the taste of the hai nan chicken rice was excellent."
Familiar favourite,"Back in town and dropped by for this reliable favourite. We knew to arrive early at 630 and got a table. 645 the queue starts, on a weekday , and gets very long after 7. On weekends, even longer

Had the usual chicken, tofu and vegetables with egg. All decent"
Yummy and friendly,Yummy food and friendly staff. The first dish I forgot the name we ordered from recommendation here but a bit too oily. The chicken is really a lot for two of us that we couldn't finish. The staff is super friendly to show us the way to our next destination.
Great Chinese dishes - especially scallops and beans,"We were the only non-Asians in the restaurant but were able to easily order our food. Dishes were tasty - with highlight being scallops and beans, and the mussels and calamari dish."
Chicken lovers & Non chicken lover,"Its look so yummy , the hanging chicken 🤗it's a pity I don't eat chicken but my friend she gave a plenty of star rating. I believe her, she packed back to Bkk 555"
Food was very good,"Better late than never. Came here back in June of 2015 when visiting Singapore. This was closed to Fraser suite apartement. We had wanted to eat more chicken rice to see which place offers the best chicken rice. This place serves some good chicken but in my humble opinion, it did not beat Tian Tian. We had stirfried bean sprouts, seafood claypot(had abalone), fried tofu, pork belly with perserved vegetable. That was enough for 4. Only thing I did not like was the cramp bench seating, feels too close to the table."
The best chicken rice ever eaten,Stays here for a business lunch. The best chicken rice I ever eaten and ever seen presented as pyramid! Also che roasted duck is wonderful a fresh juice are home made.
Disappointed,"A rather disappointing dinner. No longer getting the ""Wow"" and ""Yummy"" with the chicken. Worse no fragrance on the rice like wat I had before. The chilli is very ordinary.

Standard has indeed drop. I get better chicken rice at kovan hawker centre next to heartland mall for a fraction of the price.yuven

Given feedback to the waitress on duty and she admitted that they have changed their usual chef.

Won't go back there again at river valley outlet."
Excellent chicken rice and great Zhe char options,A regular dinner haunt in the Neighbourhood with excellent chicken rice and the variety and quality of zhe char dishes is also great.
Chicken rice,"One of the best chicken rice in Singapore. Even as a Singaporean, I go there very often to dine in. The good there are great and there is aircon. The standard of chicken rice maintain even they had many other outlet.
Car park is a little problem. But totally enjoy it."
Great Hainan Chicken Rice!,"A big fan of chicken rice, this restaurant takes it to a different level. Chicken rice are carefully prepared with great side condiments!"
Good!,"Hainan Chicken Rice tasted good, especially the boiled one. The roasted a bit dry for my taste. Many foreigners ate here. Price wise very reasonable. The fried tofu with green mayonnaise sauce also delicious."
An Old Favourite Loses Its Lustre,"This was my umpteenth visit over many years to this popular chicken rice restaurant. Eating there has always been an occasion to look forward to.
This time we were in for a surprise! The service was perfunctory, but what came like a thud of disappointment was the taste of the sauces to go with the chicken rice. Both the Chilli sauce and ginger sauce were watery and lacked enough substance to give a good feel on the palate when eating the chicken.
The most critical aspects of a chicken rice dish are these two sauces, together with the black soy sauce.
If the Chilli & ginger sauces don't measure up then you could well be eating at any ordinary chicken rice place.
One more point which I must state.
Boon Tong Kee has a policy of not serving a bowl of plain chicken soup with the chicken rice, something which is de rigueur at any chicken rice place in town. Here they expect you to make a separate order of a soup from their menu, which obviously is meant to chalking up the tab!
Frankly, in these days of rising costs, I don't see any goodwill earned by not serving simple, clear soup with the chicken rice.
Overall it was a disappointing experience even though the chicken & rice were good. Until they improve the Chilli & ginger sauces, we told ourselves we won't be returning anytime soon."
"Disgustingly Pricey, Huge Disappointment!","Paid $43.50 for 2 plates of rice, 2 drumsticks, 2 eggs, a plate of spinach, a glass of barley ice & a lime juice. Probably the most overpriced chicken rice ever (exclude those chicken rice served at hotels).

This place is just so overly rated. The chicken rice doesn't even taste or smell like the genuine Hainanese chicken rice. Standard has definitely deteriorate over the years."
Never disappointed!,I walked from Orchard MRT but it was a good walk. We ordered half chicken and scallops with green bean(?). The food was great as usual and i will always return to this place!
Best chicken rice ever,I've eaten here with my family since the early 1990s and this place is simply the best. My personal favourite is their rice which is so tasty you can have it on its own. I highly recommend visitors to Singapore to try out any of their outlets across the island.
Delicious,Went here for early dinner with friend. At 18.00 already a short que. Wait for around 5 minutes to get a small table for two. Food simply delicious. Price is ok for a personal set menu.
Chicken Rice Galore!!,Best chicken rice place ever! The place is always crowded at night so be prepared to wait. They also do takeout and delivery service.
Late night chicken rice,When staying at Great World City and jet lagged this is a regular late night spot. Chicken rice is adequate but at 3am is tastes great.
Good food but overpriced,"It is still a go to place for most people looking for chicken rice, and the service is good, but they have become quite expensive."
Local Cuisine at its best,"When my friends visit India on business tours I take them out for dinners and when I visited Singapore they returned the favor by taking me out for lunch at this amazing outlet called Boon Toon Kee. It was my first experience and I also tagged along a friend of mine with me. Located at 425, River Valley Road in Singapore the first impression of the food joint seemed very-very popular as it was packed. We had reservations so no regrets on that front.

What we ate – Roast chicken, deep fried chicken, spinach with assorted eggs, deep fried beancurd, deep fried fritters, chicken rice all gulped down with coke and lemon juice. I had a good time trying the local cuisine which is so different than the spicy Indian fare that we are used to."
Bad,"The white chicken breast tasted so bad. The meat had some kind of weird taste, like those taste which is not fresh and perhaps frozen meat.

The staff even messed up our order. We only ordered 3 dishes but the staff only sent us 2. It was not even full, perhaps only 20% occupancy during that time at 930pm. Not even apologetic.

I hope they do not represent Singapore in Chicken rice for all the tourist as they are not up to the standard and tourist will be laughing so hard."
Good chicken rice,It's a great takeout place for us! They accept phone order but no online menu available nor printed brochure! I took a photo of the takeout menu and it has been worked well!
The duck is no big deal,There are a few Boon Tong Kee Duck stalls in Singapore. We tried the one at Zion Road Food Court. Sorry to report that the duck is dry and the taste is bland. The Kway noodle is of no big deal either ...
Family lunch,"Very good lunch with family, the chicken rice and the sesame toast is great. God service, quick and efficient."
Best ever fragrant rice,"Firstly - this is place is very hard to get a car park , we circled 4 times and eventually parked at Great World and walked away.

We have heard great things about this place and wanted to try it . We were not dissatisfied with the chicken rice. The chicken was silky smooth in texture but I found the rice to be the best. We ordered side dishes - sweet n sour pork, prawn roll and beans sprouts. They were ok and fine. Iced water was $1 and the peanuts that was put in front of us was $2. I am surprised that there was no soup given with the chicken rice...

Would we go back ?? Yes but will catch a taxi next time and have just the chicken rice only"
Decent tasting chicken rice,"For SGD 5 for a plate of chicken rice, this place is quite value for money. The chicken tastes silky smooth and full of flavour.

Probably my only grouse is that they charge SGD 1 for a glass of water. Other than that, I would recommend this place."
Excellent value for money,"It's indeed quality cook; it doesn't seem fancy from outside, but the menu has interesting dishes and it is definitively tastefull"
Fantastic,"You could easily miss this place or see it from the street and not think much of a spot to enter as is somewhat basic.

However very clean with great friendly service and fast...

I had the pleasure of being taken by a local who told me it was the best place in the area for the local favorite ""chicken and rice"".

Sounds a little boring and sure, it's a simple dish.

That said it is simply delicious and the rice is fragrant and simply stunning.

Great spot and I look forward to being back to try other items on the menu."
Re : Slowly Getting Out Of Flavour,"One of my favourite restaurant to bring my friends / associates

Was there yesterday again

Crowd : Always Packed During lunch

Convenience : open carpark behind

Food : every branch is diff in type of dishes they carry, for river valley branch, unfortunately it doesnt carry my favourite crabmeat steamegg

Price : $$$$ (expensive since the quality seems to be dipping)

Ok lets keep this review to not only my recent experience but a overall experience over the years. I always like BTK chicken rice, chicken is smooth since they dipped it back into ice after steaming, rice is fragant, side dishes are ok..but quality seems to be dipping and u are in the end paying for a brand instead of the food IMO

Nevertheless, for tourists still worth a try cause chicken rice is one of our local favourites"
Very delivicious,"This is my favourite Restaurant for Chinese food. I simply love every single dish especially their roasted chicken, sweet & sour pork and pork ribs! Very delicious! Thank you for providing outstanding food and service! Well done"
Tasty chicken ride,"We visited this restaurant for dinner based on friends recommendation.

We took a taxi there as there was no train stations nearby (MRT).

They serve more than chicken rice. We ordered their signature steam chicken rice and it was delicious. Other dishes we ordered included the black bean ribs and a spinach and egg dish. Both were average and rather bland.

I would recommend the chicken rice but not the other two dishes.

Service was prompt. We walked in at 6.30pm. By 7.10pm, there was a large queue outside. I guess we were lucky as we did not book. Would recommend booking if you need a table beyond 7pm."
Good Chicken Rice,"Good quality chicken rice. The place is a touch difficult to get to as no MRT station nearby, but the food is good including other menu items. Very reasonable price too. Seems to be a hit with the locals as this place got very busy from about 8pm. Will return next time in sg."
Hainan Rice at its Best,"Recommended by some people, we went to Boon Tong Kee to eat their famous Hainan Rice last month. The fragrant of the rice and the shiny rice are really tempting us to eat right away. We ordered Steam Chicken and the Roast Chicken, both are nice but I prefer the Steam one. They also offered us to try Clay Fish with Black pepper sauce and it was really good. Overall, this is well recommended, but one thing we have to notice, at Boon Tong Kee, the Hainan Rice is not served with clear Soup like in any other Restaurant."
Juicy but slightly expensive shrimp toast!!!,"It was lunch, it was our last meal on our six days explorer of Singapore. We had a different chicken rice as our first meal in a hacker market. Coming to Boon Tong Kee since we hear it's one of the best and it was so close to the Fraser Suites River Valley we were staying, we had the chance to check out and walk over for a nice lunch before heading to the airport.
Coming here was so different from the hacker market one, service was not so great. Not sure if it's normal in Chinese places in Singapore or just famous places...it felt the same at the hacker market one too...staffs I would considered rude...
But overall, good and yummi food, but have to try the shrimp toast...a little pricey, but it was worth it, so juicy!!!"
Loved this place!.,Have the chicken rice. Steamed breast. Have the staple Singaporean dish and you won't break the bank at around 7SGD. Definitely a must have. While in Singapore. Also great for those who need a protein healthy diet low in carbs. I washed it all down with an Evian.
The best chicken rice,"We kept coming back to this for the chicken rice! Tender and juicy, the sauce the perfectbpalance of sweet and salty. And the rice! Omg the rice!"
Best Hainan Chicken in Singapore,Their Hainan chicken rice without a doubt is the best is singapore. Have many branches but this one in river valley is the best. Also try the soup and tofu. Service is fast and friendly.
Go-To Place for Hainanese Chicken,"Boon Tong Kee was highly recommended to us for its Hainanese (Boiled) Chicken, and it did not disappoint. Their chicken was tender and flavorful, and we liked the chicken rice as well. Their servings are large, and the prices were reasonable."
Some excellent food with a chat,Rather good chicken rice and the waitresses do like to chat. Good clean tables. Rice:good Chicken: good Atmosphere:good.
Very disappointed with takeaway,"Bought a few Chicken Rice to go.
I was very disappointed by the quantity of the meat and also by the quality of the meat.
One of them had no skin in the chicken.
One of them had just boney parts of the chicken.
Chicken Rice at some hawker center is actually better and cheaper.
I will not come back to this outlet again.
East Coast outlet offered a better takeaway.

Takeaway costed S$5, which was more expensive than other outlets."
Great chilli paste,Price for chicken rice slightly above average. The other cooked dishes are great to complement the chicken rice too. The spicy chili paste specially made is a must try condiment.
Good food,"Very nice food, especially good chicken rice................. had ordered sweet & sour pork, fried bean sprout with salted fish & deep fried prawn cake."
Tasty Juicy,"Was there in Jan 2016. I love this place. Always tasty and juicy chicken.

As the place is well-known, expected a long queue before my turn. As there was two of us and we weren't choosy with indoor or out, we got in quite quick. We had a half chicken and a plate of long beans. Delicious!

You should eat here!"
Very good chicken rice,"We went at 11 pm after a trip from the night safari with our kids. We had the steamed chicken, tofu, bean sprouts, shrimp cake and rice. They are all very good. The steamed chicken is one of the tastiest and tenderest Hainan chicken weve tried. The rice is also perfectly steamed and not dry unlike other chicken rice. Will definitely come back here."
Yum,It's hyped up as one of the better places and it doesn't disappoint. You may want to order 2 portions. One is on the small side
Chicken Rice is a must try,"The food was good, but I do not recommend budget travellers to eat here because it is very pricey! We paid 100SGD for a meal of 4 people!"
Good Chicken Rice,"This is a popular restaurant that stays open late. We were there at about 11pm on a Sunday night, so it was not too crowded. The service was good and the food was served quickly."
Great Chicken Rice,"Best place to get Chicken Rice. My preference is for Skinless, white chicken rice set and they are the best. They Tofu chunks served with green mayonnaise is amazing. Tried Cereal Prawns, Kai lan with Garlic all was excellent. Will definitely come back."
Above average,This place chicken is quite the same as the rest of their branches. However the service here is slightly better than the rest.
We keep going back!,This is our favourite Chicken & Rice place. Forget those highly recommended stalls in Hawker Centres. Boon Tong Kee is a cut above the rest. How do they manage to give their rice such intense flavour and light fluffy texture? Both BBQ and Boiled Chicken are good. We really enjoyed the pork spare ribs last time - so rich and tasty.
Delicious Chicken Rice,I just visited Boon Tong Kee for the first time and I'm impressed that their service are very fast. The chicken rice is fragrant and the chicken is tender and delicious. I recommend you try their cuisine
Tender chicken,"Price is a little on the high side but chicken is tender and succulent, chili sauce decent and rice fragrant and fluffy. Service is also prompt and polite. Overall: very good."
