Tea Lounge Weekend Buffet,Service rendered to us is superb. Food is Yummy. Only thing the Char Siew is a bit Sweet and Hard. Overall is fantastic experience
Weekend High Tea at Tea Lounge,2nd time back and Always love the weekend high tea here. feel it is the best value of it and standard was absolutely fantastic!
Great ambience,Food is yummy and the best part is the service from the Tea Lounge Staff. Will definitely be back again.
Excellent Service and Wonderful Tea,"Whoever go there must try the Regent Signature Blend, one will be amazed by the tea. All the staff offer extremely good service. Enjoyable afternoon."
High Tea at Regent Hotel,"Service was good and attentive. But we were let down by the food. The sandwiches were dry and fillings were a bit off. So were the savoury tarts - fillings have oxidised. We asked to have the sandwiches replaced and made fresh but they were not any better. We end up not eating the sandwiches at all, The quiche was good though."
So-so!,"Brought my young boy together for a high tea with my besties; overall experience was below our expectation. Food was ok, not much choices on cakes/dessert, can't find any fruit after our meal. The Lobster porridge and Laksa tasted average."
Warm Hospitality By Ramesh,"The space occupied Tea Lounge serves high tea in the afternoon, wine and bites in the evening (under the name of Park90). My friends and I were there for both afternoon tea and drinks in the evening within a week. We were greeted by the warm hospitality of Ramesh, the manager (who was on duty on both occasions)! We had great conversations with Ramesh, who introduced us to the truffle cheese focassia served by Park90. It was so yummy that we craved for more. We look forward to be at Tea Lounge for their weekend high tea, which includes a wide variety of warm food."
Wonderful afternoon tea,"Another extremely pleasant visit to the weekend afternoon tea at Regent. The seafood porridge, chilled tomatoes and char siew are to die for. Ramesh and team were excellent and his warm reception makes the visit even more memorable. Highly recommended!"
Raving review and Outstanding service,"Restaurant manager provided excellent service, kept asking how was the food. Food is definitely really good and worth the hassle to come. One of the best high tea! Thanks for the birthday celebration too! Highly recommended!"
Regent Hotel Hi Tea Buffet,The food here is fantastic. Not to mention their service is superb too. All the staff here are super friendly and well mannered. A great thanks to Mr Ramesh who specially prepare for me the salad. Will come and have it again
Outstanding customer service,"Had a wonderful service experience at the Tea Lounge earlier this afternoon.

The service senior (tall gentleman in a suit) was superb - gave us enough and very clear information about the food and the set, seated us earlier but anticipated and informed us that they would start at 2pm as per stated time.

After our meal, at the door, he took the trouble to suggest the weekend high tea as an option, even explaining why it was a good value meal.

Gave enough info about the parking coupon - for basement lots and not any others.

It sounds simple but it takes a lot of experience to deliver such a just right customer service experience.

We did not get his name but trust he is easily identifiable to the management.

Such outstanding service should be recognised."
Long overdue review for a place which always remain in my Top 3 Hi Tea spot in Singapore!,"A long overdue review. Been to many hi tea in Singapore. Regent Tea Lounge always stays at my Top 3 spot.
Their service staff are always professional and welcoming. Sincere & Attentive service especially from Charlene and the Manager.
Food never disappoints, Back in Oct where buffet were not allowed, all their items were served to our table. All their dishes were plated beautifully, and delicious."
Thai themed hi tea,"Great service, cozy relax place for a weekday hi tea. Staff patiently introduced to us every one single item on the 3 tier snacks üëç. Serving us with passion and smile, good job Regent Singapore üá∏üá¨"
Good service on first visit,Charlene took good care of us here. She recommended that scones be eaten first when it's warm and soft. She also made good recommendation of regent Singapore tea. It is my first time coming and she made a very good first impression amongst all the rest of the service crew. Thank you Charlene.
"High Tea - March 19, 2022 3:00 pm",We are well serve with the friendly and helpful staff and captain including the chief of Tea Lounge. The serving of food and beverages are generous. It's a nice ambience for chatting with friends. We will come back in the near future. Recommended to all.
Do not come here anymore,Do not come here . We used to enjoyed come here for high tea for almost 3 years. This 2022 seem to be a downhill for tea lounge. The website did not mention that they did not provide buffet ala carte high tea anymore. My teen sons who have big appetite used to enjoyed here so much. As food and price come at par. Waste time and dollars to have high tea here. Service also downhill serve by mid old lady who seem not happy being a server yet she works as a server. Go to goodwood or hyatt fullertons for buffet high tea forget about this one for sure.
Excellent selection of tea and delicious scones and pastries.,"Service was well taken care by Mel and a korean guy server which I didn't get the name. We were assigned to a cosy corner seat and from the start to finish of the high tea session, we were treated like VIPs.

Wide selection of pastries were made available. We chose the three tier high tea set. The tea were really awesome too. Made the session very worthwhile.

Exceptional service were given to us by Mel and your assistants. We appreciate the kind gesture of checking our tea and refilling it when it is almost finished. Such attentiveness is hard to find and I am glad we found it here.

Keep up the good work, guys. We shall return again for another high tea soon."
Birthday celebration,No more free flow of high tea from Jan 2022 for weekday as stated by the waitress. Saw some blog stated that free flow about one week ago. So so disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è ‚òπÔ∏èNot really worth it without the free flow. Comes with two drinks.
An enjoyable afternoon!,"Thank you for the prompt service during the high tea service. the food was served warm and the spread was delightful! Loved the seafood porridge

Special kind mention to the entire team. Alice took care of our needs and checked on us at appropriate times, so did Ramesh who arrived with hot cheng teng after. It was a nice touch to end the afternoon.

Also to the chef who constantly brought food to the table :)

Thank you for extending your outstanding service to us despite the current tourism climate we are in!"
Tea lounge,Taste of food is still ok but variety is not as good as last time before Covid. Example like the seafood porridge ingredients are not as fantastic as last time. Ambience and service are still good. Something to highlight is the chargrilled char Siew still taste the best throughout these years.
Wonderful Chinese weekday afternoon tea set,The weekday Chinese afternoon tea set took me by surprise. There is a Chinese twist in the usual tea snacks that we are used to. The savory dishes are impressive as the Chinese twist enhance the dishes. For instance the bak kwa quiche blew me away. The combination was great. Service is also excellent. Strongly recommended.
Nice ambience and friendly staff,"We visited tea lounge for afternoon high tea with my hubby and kids. Positives - very friendly and welcoming staff, gluten free and vegetarian options. I really appreciated this as it‚Äôs not common in Singapore to have chefs customise to your dietary needs. My girls loved the scones and we loved the high tea presentation too. What could be improved is some child friendly options like little cakes and pastries. Hot chocolate is a good drink on offer. Additionally milk shake for kids could be another choice as they usually wouldn‚Äôt go for tea or coffee based drinks. All in all, good for an enjoyable visit."
Won‚Äôt go back again.,Won‚Äôt go back again. Food wasn‚Äôt good at all. Cakes was bad. Service was slow. Not worth the price at all. Standard had drop alot.
Excellent,"The service is super excellent, ambience and food. It wa a quiet place to chat and tea was excellent..the cakes all.was good"
"Quiet, elegant ambiance",The food was good but we missed the selection that used to be in the buffet. Great tea selection. Staff were very hospitable and polite.
High Tea,The service and food is great.we love the dessert. Special thanks to Sheila for her friendliness. She make us feel at home and aways checking in on us. We will definitely come back again and again. Fr Celia and Meili
Refillable High Tea,I was so impressed that the charges include refillable 3 tier plates high tea dishes and 2 drinks for each person. My friend was surprised with slice of cake given while chitchatting. Thumbs up for their good service and hospitality!
Afternoon tea at Tea Lounge,"Afternoon tea presentation at its best, modern looking tasty savouries, fantastic sweets with good selections Staff were smiling and hospitable, though it seemed to be a shortage of servers"
High Tea,The seats allocated to us was very warm and we request to change. Their service was very good however the pastry not worth the price.
Great afternoon tea selection,Good mix of savoury and sweet items. The char siew (roast pork) and the lobster laksa were very delicious.
Accolades knocked off,"Tea Lounge has always sat up there in the compendium of the best high tea‚Äôs in Singapore. However, that accolade is severely tested by patchy services and hit and miss dishes. Such a shame it is. Due to COVID restrictions, the once hearty feast fit for a king spread is now reduced to ala carte servings, served at a go.

Pork char siew was the absolute best. I‚Äôm a pescatarian but I had a heavenly slice. Asparagus consomm√© was delish but it was served in a bowl for 4 persons making it hard to divvy up. Or was it meant to be a hunger games slug-out? While I skipped out on the wagyu beef, my friends lauded it. Salmon looked paltry and tasted meh. When we requested for extra servings, chef wasn‚Äôt pleased. Tomatoes on ice were so sweet you thought they were fruit versions of ice wine! The sweet finishes were the great uplift. The chocolate macaron has a surprise zing ‚Äì sparkle bits darted around your mouth! All the other sweet offerings were fit for deity and wonderfully delish. We had awesome service from some staff but really terrible service from one of the waitress who constantly incurred the wrath of my friends with constant interruptions and rude cut-in‚Äôs. She presented me a bill that had an over-priced GST but I couldn‚Äôt be arsed to quibble.

The high‚Äôs and the low‚Äôs do average it out so it‚Äôs worth a seating if you could let some things slide."
Weekday High Tea,"High tea selection was great, service was impeccable and ambience was on point. Manager Ramesh and his staff are very attentive and helpful. Overall a great experience, will be back!"
Comfortable lounge to have an leisurely afternoon on your own or with love ones,Quiet tea lounge and spacious to have an leaisurely afternoon with family / love ones. For special occasions etc :-)
Lovely high tea at the Tea Lounge!,Went to try out the high tea once dine in was allowed for 2 persons. The food was great and the service was excellent. Will definitely go back again with other family members when more persons are allowed to dine in together.
Lovely high tea,Wonderfully balanced flavours for the savouries and aesthetically exquisite desserts. Planning for the next visit with the family once bigger groups are allowed. Hope the menu will be refreshed so that we get to try new items each time.
Good ambience,"Ambience was good, cozy and comfortable for small gathering among families and friends. However food selection can be better. Sandwich and scorne a little bit hard, it would be nicer if softer. Weekend hi tea food selections are better. Preferably going for weekend hi tea more often."
Wonderful afternoon at the Tea Lounge,Both hotel and the lounge are clean and welcoming. Staff were frienfly and quick to lead waiting customers to their tables. Moderate crowd for weekday high tea. I enjoyed the savouries more. Good tea selection. Hard to get servers' attention from the round seats with high partition.
Fantastic service,We had a wonderful experience - the service was above and beyond and the food was great - so much food! Highly recommend!
An elegant afternoon spent at Tea Lounge,"Had a lovely time here at Tea Lounge at Regent Singapore. Was here on Good Friday for their High Tea and was very happy with my dining experience here. The service provided by Ramesh and his team is superb. Everyone from the Chefs to Floor Staff are wonderful and friendly. It was such a good experience interacting with them. Ramesh in particular was super friendly and had short conversations with us.

Food wise, it does exceed expectations with regards to the Savory offerings. We particularly loved the Caramelised Kurobuta Pork Chaw Siew and had so many portions of it that they ran out for our seating (Apologies to the chefs and Ramesh, it was just too delicious). Other highlights were the Chicken wings, Otak, Wagyu Beef and the Congee. Honestly, the team there nailed the Savory items on point.

With regards to the sweets selection, I feel that it did not meet expectations. The Savory selection just WOW-ed me, however the Sweets selection couldn't beat quality. Scones and Lemon Meringue were nice. Not to mention, the sweet tomatoes given towards the end were delicious.

One note is that drinks are not free flow here. You only get 2 rounds of Coffee/Tea/Chocolate.

Overall it was a delight afternoon spent here at Regent and would definitely return back here in the future. Honestly, will recommend for sure."
Lovely time at Tea Lounge.,"First time back since the pandemic started, and was impressed by the warm service, great food, and reassuring safe distancing measures. It was a lovely experience that left me wanting to return again soon.

I was there on a weekend and really liked how the current buffet format had been tailored to fit COVID-19 rules. Food quality was excellent as before, served hot to my table at a pace that was just right‚ÄîI had ample time to enjoy each dish, yet didn‚Äôt have to wait long (if at all) for the next dish to be served once I was done. Empty plates were promptly cleared, my tea refilled, and used cutlery exchanged without me having to ask at all despite it being a busy weekend session, which I felt really spoke for the Tea Lounge team‚Äôs attentiveness. Several staff members took the initiative to check on me throughout the meal. When I mentioned preferring to skip a few of the main courses, Mr. Ramesh thoughtfully offered to bring me my three-tiered tea set first, just so I wouldn't be kept waiting without food even though I wouldn't have minded. Requests for food and tea refills were promptly fulfilled each time.

Besides what I felt was a successful transition to an √† la carte buffet system, groups of diners were also seated safely apart, and the queue to enter was well-managed with Mr. Ramesh politely reminding diners to keep to safe distancing markers on the floor.

All in all, I felt very well-taken care of and enjoyed my me-time a lot. Cheers to the Tea Lounge team!"
Mediocre service and quality for this price,"During the booking request (made at least 3 weeks in advance), I requested for a sofa seat, however we were given a seat with individual chairs and a very small table. I later requested for a sofa seat and the request was granted with a little hesitation by the staff.

Food was mediocre in quality, the savories and sweets are non-refillable and what‚Äôs a little shocking is that you are only allowed 2 choices of coffee/tea. They are refillable but basically you‚Äôll only be trying these 2 flavours throughout the whole session. The drinks did not come even when we were halfway through the food and we had to ask for it again.

Table and seats were a little dirty with some visible stains.

Overall not the kind of quality and service I would expect for this kind of price. There are better afternoon teas out there."
Weekend High Tea - compliments for Ramesh & Sheila,"Quality food with high service standard. This is what keeps bringing me back to Regent Tea Lounge again & again. Love their wide array of savory selection, especially their flavor-infused cherry tomatoes, yuzu confit wild salmon & caramelized Kurobuta pork char siew are phenomenal! Of course, I really enjoy the classy ambience, coupled with friendly and highly professional service staff. Special mention on Ramesh & Sheila, who made a significant different to my dining experience. Well done and keep it up!"
Excellent place for high tea!,"Made a booking online a made a request for a window seat and I loved how they mentioned that when I was escorted to my seat! Lovely botanical ambience and design. Our server Sheila was such a good host! She recommended teas based on our preferences and we really loved the Regent house tea. It has gold dust inside and was a heavenly black tea, I probably refilled it 10 times. Sheila also helped us position the food to get us the best photos. Overall it was a great experience! Will come back!"
"Good food, service could be better","While the range of food is good comparatively to outside, we had some miscomm w the staff over the chope vouchers. We checked w the staff before buying the chope vouchers but they didn't let us use it. While they claim the high tea were on promo price and can't use the voucher concurrently, they refuse to admit it was a miscommunication with their staff. I felt the manager could had admit their staff gave misleading information instead on catching on the use of English to make us feel we are in wrong."
Went as a party of 05 for high tea,"Went as a party of 05 for a get together high tea.
The overall experience was good.
The pros:-
-svc staff Sheila was bubbly and positive,made the mood lively and happy.
-Ramesh was professional and hospitable,came by to check on the table
-food overall is good,special mention for Chef Chong who came by and prepared ‚Äúspecial‚Äù dish for our party.it was delicious and much much appreciated!

The cons:-
-the table for 05 the seats were way too low to eat properly.would appreciate higher chairs n table since the venue to used for dining(these seating are fine for only sandwiches and pastries but not when main courses are served)
-the fried chicken presentation n outlook was nice but tasted frozen.
-the pricing of high tea could be more competitive or at least with more selections.
A basis for comparison,for eg Ritz Carlton colony lunch is priced lower but with more selections and premier food products. So for a high tea with a higher price point than lunch buffet at Ritz,there should be more selections.

Overall 5stars for the staff,3.5 stars for the food and 3 stars for the pricing"
A Lovely Time,"Had a wonderful time at the Tea Lounge today. The staff were really attentive and accommodating! A friend of ours is vegetarian and the servers and chefs went out of their way to bring us vegetarian dishes that were not on the menu! It was delicious and the non-vegetarians benefited too! The food did not disappoint. The char Siew, laksa and beef was exceptionally good. A special shout out to Sheila for her bubbly personality and for making our experience such an enjoyable one!"
Great food,"Food is great (all the tarts are good quality). Service is ok, one lady senior staff member was very helpful, but it was difficult to get the attention of waiters at times.

One gripe is the value, which is why I knocked a star off. Given that there's no semi-buffet option to help yourself, there isn't any seafood or counter food available. I know this is a government regulation but I don't think anything has been done to top up the tiered tea, to make up for the difference in value for customers.

Overall, might return, but maybe only when they've started serving seafood or other food to complement the high tea tier again."
High Tea,"Thanks Alice for the excellent service at Tea Lounge, my parents, husband and I enjoyed our high tea immensely, we were welcomed so warmly and taken care of so well during our meal, thanks so much, appreciate it!"
Delicious post Christmas lunch,"For most people, Sunday is a day of rest, a chance to breathe after the manic week that's just taken place. It also raises a few questions and first world problems such as 'Should we do a buffet lunch or afternoon tea?'

Our family love a Sunday lunch treat and our two girls under 4 (yep, save a prayer for us!) have become accustomed to it. The place for us is Tea Lounge@ Regent Singapore.

The warmth and genuine welcome by Ramesh and the team sets us up for a wonderful luncheon experience.
We are non-meat eaters and Chef Chong goes out of his way to provide delicious dishes that cater to our needs.

This is our second visit to Tea Lounge and won't be the last...our girls wouldn't have it any other way."
Mind blowing service,Mind blowing service from Manager Ramesh and Sheila. Food and tea selections were also as good as ever. Will be back for more.
Lovely Afternoon Tea,"After trying various afternoon tea establishments across Singapore, the Tea Lounge at Regent is my husband and my top choice. The hospitality of Ramesh and Sheila‚Äôs team stands out, making us feel right at home. The staples (comforting seafood congee, perfectly glazed char siew, etc) and a three tiered stand with a variety of seasonal offerings were served to our table by the team. The only challenge for us is our limited stomach capacities and difficulties in reserving a slot as it is so popular!"
The Charm of Simple Sincerity,"Regent has always been a charm that stood tall with time. I was at the Tea-Lounge with my mother on the 12th Nov 2020 for afternoon tea. Like before, the people there aren't just getting the service done. They are there to deliver their service passionately right.

My family and I shared many good time with Regent. Our first family wedding banquet was held there more than 20 years ago. When I wae a teenager, I was provided with a long pants when I turned up in a berms for a lunch at Summer Palace. I brought my date for our first cocktail experience at the lounge. They sure are beautiful memories I have for Regent.

Now, Ramesh and his wonderful team has made it again. I was having a private afternoon tea with my mother. Their attentivness had added more weights to my fond impression of this place.

Every little effort made won't go unnoticed. They would just form a lovely memory that we share with family and friends, which you and your staff might never find out.

In this challenging time, your consistency in delighting your guests in the most simple sincerity will not fail you. Is only a matter of time.

Thank you.

For those who are more interested in the material aspect, personally I was delighted by their choices especially the Finger Sandwiches spread. The savoury macaron is in my opinion, exotic. I like it when they have a cake stand for each guest and you may request for a second, third... serving on any of the items you fancy. That is generous as some places would only offer the less popular items for repeat serving.

Thank you."
Amazing service to go with the great food for weekend hi tea buffet,"We had two excellent visits to the Tea Lounge @ Regent Singapore for weekend hi tea within 1 month, and here's why:
- the quality of food is great, one of the best we have tasted in hi tea buffets. If you are a Char Siew person, you have to try their rendition of this dish. We ordered three servings for just the two of us. The prawn & fish congee and the laksa are also great dishes that are worth a second helping.
- the service. This is truly commendable. Those of us who frequent buffets during this period will know that a buffet served to the table can be a disaster waiting to happen, with slow service, and often missed items. Not this restaurant, we were amazed at the speed of the service, the attention of all the staff and the joy on their faces whenever they approach us. This is a rare show of commitment to the job and to see everyone seemingly enjoying serving us, despite how much running around we could see them doing, just make us feel so much more special.
And in these times, such feelings are really hard to come by.

I must specially commend two of the staff of the Lounge (whom I managed to catch their names): Mr. Lim Chee Hao and Manager Ramesh. I can see how committed they are to their roles and how attentive they are to make sure that we don't wait long for our food. Ramesh's leadership is apparent and it shows in the morale of all the staff in this outlet.

A joy to taste the good food served, and an even greater joy to watch this orchestra in action!"
High tea,Went for high tea at the Tea Lounge. We were allocated a nice cosy table. Food was excellent. We opted for the free flow of gin cocktails which were superb. Alice who had made our drinks was excellent. We were served by Alice and Ian who are both professional in their service and we'll definitely give them both 5 stars!
Excellent,"The service and food was excellent! Ambience was lovely, not too crowded and lots of personal space for a great afternoon. Highly recommend and will go back again."
Tea Lounge weekend hi-tea,"It's our second time returning to Regent Tea lounge to celebrate our birthdays. The desserts were a delight as always and my friends loved the seafood congee, Wagyu beef and charsiew. I particularly enjoyed the scones and Regent Oolong tea. Felt that the finger sandwiches could be more tasty and less dry. Service was impeccable right from the concierge. Like to specially mention staff Mr. Issac and Ms Sheila for their professional and warm hospitality; 2 pregnant ladies and a mummy with a 2 year old toddler - we felt so well taken care of! Thank you Tea Lounge! Lookong forward to our 3rd time return."
Best high tea in Singapore,"Husband and I were there for the weekend High Tea.
We have tried various hotels for High Tea in Singapore, inc Ritz, St Regis, Fullerton
Hands down, Regent remains the best!
Quality of food is great, great variety as well. The Congee was our favourite, crispy wings delic, the char siew was Super tasty as well.
We appreciate that food is served hot, and even if they weren‚Äôt (e.g. scones), staff are more than happy to heat it up for us. Perhaps, the finger sandwiches can be just a little larger in size. Not to get me wrong, we were both extremely full, the food is filling, only that with its current size, it‚Äôs difficult to know what the sandwiches are meant to taste like - for our non-gourmet/expert/professional taste buds.
We still enjoyed very much!!
In this pandemic, social distancing measures are in place. Safety/cleanliness do not appear to be an issue. We are very satisfied."
Excellent service but poor high tea set,"Is a shame Regent hotel Tea Lounge has nice ambience and all the staff are so pleasant and nice but the Tea Set is such a letdown. Sandwich is like what you get at 7-eleven, the entire set seems to come from a typical HDB neighborhood bread shop. Upside is a place you can sit and relax for 3hrs. A bottle of champagne cost only SGD 88 and outstanding staff Sheila deserves a medal."
Awesome,"Food is nice , nice ambience , staff is friendly and helpful . Hoping buffet style will be open soon ."
Tea Lounge Hi Tea,"The ambience is good but for the price we paid, the food is nothing to shout about. I would expect higher standard and better tasting food. Fortunately, one of the staff, Sheila, has made up all the differences with her pleasant and attentive service."
Excellent Service for Staff,"This is a commendation to the excellent service provided by the Tea Lounge staff. They were all very attentive and provided top notch service.

I like to specially mention Manager Ramesh, Sheila and Chef Chong. I gave a feedback on a dish served to Sheila and it was immediately made known to the Manager and the chef. The instant communication had shown that they really valued our feedback and did an exchange of the dish. They also made the rounds to make sure that the food and service provided is good. On top of that, despite being quite busy, Sheila served with a smile and walked with a purpose when serving!

Great job guys and will definitely come back again. Thank you!"
Regent Tea Lounge,"After several months due to COVID-19, we finally had the chance to come back to the Tea Lounge. It's our favourite tea venue in Singapore. We had the weekday tea set - despite the lack of a buffet, the spread offered was more than sufficient and the usual high quality food we expected. Great service by the Tea Lounge team as usual!"
GOLD tea and gold service standard,"A great venue for a weekday high tea with my sisters...the Regent signature blend tea is a wonderful surprise with ""gold flakes"". The high tea are limited but good quality. We were so blessed to be served by Alice and her team...explaining to us the type of tea. Kudos and keep up the good work"
Excellent Service at High Tea. Staff makes you feel at home,"The staff at the Regent Hotel had been really nice. The gentleman at the drop off area was nice enough to walk me in to the Tea Lounge and asked about my day.
The high tea was wonderful and very cosy and comfortable. Mr Ramesh was very attentive and always made sure we had enough hot tea in our pots.
He was very professional and spoke very well. He was also very warm and sincere."
Kind staff,We had a fantastic spread at the afternoon High Tea at Tea Lounge. Live piano and the seating was nice. Service was really good and friendly. Mr Letchu at Concierge was kind enough to help me charge my phone as well.
personalised and warmth service,"I have always like a cosy and relaxing place for the afternoon and tis place is a rare gem.

i frequented its hightea buffet as this is the place where you could just spend hours reading or having cosy moments when close friends. the food served was of high quality and mostly was freshly made in-house ( I asked! wink). probably owing to the smaller scale of the place and crowd, the food items were freshly made during top-up. not like many other places which were already prepared and left in the fridge for swift top-up. Those who are waist conscious would be pleased to know that the menu served were relatively healthier (as compared to most hightea buffet ) yet satisfying.

if you are expecting a buffet of 'local delights', then tis is not the place for you. this is not the place to indulge in food of 'value' or to stuff oneself so as to skip the later dinner.

this is The place if you wanna enjoy a light moment with your favorite book ; or a private conservation with your close ones; in the midst of light bites and tea. the live planist was an excellent touch.

the best has yet to come.

what tis place did best, better than many other well-known similar establishments, is its personalised yet unobtrusive service. kudos to the team who never fails to impress me.

this is the place where service providers should learn about true service, first hand. while you are reading, your tea was top-up. when you raised your eyes for enquiry, they know they are needed. Service was well delivered by looking into the customers' body language.

the crew dont approach with a purpose, they come to you for a purpose, your purpose.

So thank you for the every positive experiences i have with you. all my friends agreed with me after my recommendations. you guys are doing a great job.

PS: selfishly i hope this place remains a rare gem which only a selectful of people knows."
Friends Meetup,Place is really nice for a small gathering for friends. Loved the live station which made crepes on the spot!
afternoon tea at tea lounge,afternoon tea at tea lounge was a real treat. you get a 3 tiered selection and the rest of the items like dessert and salad and live crepe station is unlimited. service was excellent.
Nice,Perfect service from the beginning to the end ! Large choice of food! I recommend that place if you want to spend a good moment with family/friends
Compliments,"It was my first time dining at the tea lounge of Regent. It was a good experience. I'd also liked to compliment on one particular staff that had stood out from the rest.
Ramesh was the one who settled me in to my table. He'd made an introduction of the whole high tea dining options.
I was impressed by the taste and standard of the food served here. Savoury food were great. Scones were good. Beautiful desserts were not too sweet at all. Really loved my dining experience here. Gryphon tea selections are served here.
Ramesh caught my attention with his service deliver and his attention to details. Trolley was used to top up hot water for the guests' tea pots. Immediately he would wiped away any droplet from the surface of the trolley immediately.
He is always smiley and attentive and he would engaged with the guest to ensure the comforts of all.
That's so lacking in Singapore f&b service industry. He's definitely a gem among the rocks. Cheers."
Quality food and good service,"Food are all delicious. Especially the asian flavour like King crab porridge, nyonya kuih, laksa. Dessert bar is fantastic too!"
Almost 5 stars experience,"This is our first time here at Regent Tea Lounge trying their weekday night tea. Currently they are running a 50% off second set promotion and I must say it is very value for money since you get to spend quality time with your friends from 12pm to 5pm. The service staff and manager were very attentive throughout the whole session.
There is 1 star missing only due to the lack of surprise in the desserts provided and the platter that was given to us did not contain any ingredient that was expensive. This is just my own personal preference since I have gotten the likes of foie gras and lobster from high tea elsewhere. That being said, the free flow semi buffet options do make up for it if you like the sweet treats.
Do give it a try if you want to have a peaceful chill out with the accompaniment of live piano playing."
Delicious high tea,Beautiful setting for high tea. Service is absolutely fantastic. Servers were very attentive. The menu offers many tea choices. We particularly loved the scones and all of the items on the tiers. The buffet items were also very good.
High Tea,"Good ambience with lots of food to choose from. Had a wonderful experience overall. Would highly recommend for everyone to try. Special shoutouts to Ramesh and Jade as they were very attentive, friendly and very accommodative to our requests throughout our dining experience."
High Five for Tea Lounge,Me and my friend enjoyed our high tea buffet experience. Good food. Great venue. Awesome staff. Add this to your must do/ visit list!
My favourite high tea buffet,"Quite possibly the best high tea buffet around. Just celebrated my birthday with my hubby today (lots of pple celebrating their birthdays here too, heard the bday songs playing over and over again). Ramesh and his team was very attentive and accommodating and helped my hubby staged a surprise for me (although Ramesh almost spoiled the surprise thinking that the present was lost under his care ).

Food was simply delish, esp the prawn congee, seafood noodles, charsiew and awesome selection of desserts. I think I've over-ate my whole month worth of calories quota! Keep it up tea lounge!"
Best Hi Tea Buffet!,"I had just finished our hi tea buffet at Regent and i cant wait to share my honest review about this place.

Venue
Beautiful Tea Lounge at the lobby area of Regent. We had a beautiful booth seat for my girlfriend and myself. It was extravagant!

Service
Best service by the crew and chef! We had such great personal service from the crew. The crew kept making sure we are fine and we were really well taken care of. The chef of tea lounge served us incredible canapes like his plum preserved cherry tomatoes which we LOVED! We like it so much we requested for more which the chef so kindly provided us with. He also served us Char Siew which was seriously the best we had ever tasted.

Food
It was a Hi Tea Buffet but the spread did not only consist of sweet treats and cakes. They also had herbal chicken; Chili Crab; Satay; King Prawn Congee etc etc. All the food was really good and my best friend and i had totally nothing to complain about. We were not rushed into stuffing ourselves with food as we were enjoying the ambience and the amicable service of the staff.

We will definitely be back!"
Elegant festive afternoon tea,"Had the weekday afternoon tea set which included a 3 tier stand (savory quiches and scones) and the buffet table (unlimited desserts, salads, cheese and other mini savory items). Each of us could also choose 2 types of tea from the menu - we ordered the vanilla, chocolate and earl grey tea.

Loved the Christmas decorations in the hotel and the live piano music added to the relaxed ambience of the place. The staff were friendly and they were prompt in clearing our empty plates.

I highly recommend the afternoon tea here as it was definitely value for money especially as there were unlimited desserts and savory items. The chocolate tea was my favourite as well! Will certainly return."
Great High Tea Restaurant in Singapore,The foods are great and delicious especially the Char Siew (Roasted Pork). Great variety. But only the price is a bit expensive.
High Quality Buffet with Excellent Food and Tea Selection,"Superb food of local variety and also for high tea. Love the customer service, and they have tried in all ways to make you feel comfortable at the Tea Lounge, over and above the food."
Weekday high tea,"the weekday tea at regent was rather disappointing.

Items were not very appetising. Scones were tasty but some other items were dry. Did not even touch any of the pastries, and I love pastries. There were three of us and only served two measly pieces of roast pork.

Some positive comments - service was good. A good selection of tea, complimentary parking,pretty warm ambience setting.

Weekend tea at Regent is far better,which I have tried."
Bask in Weekday High Tea in Barcelona,"I always love Tea Lounge's thematic high tea and this one is no different, with a slant on catalonian delights. I love the ambience and everyone's very civil; which tends to be chaotic when it's full buffet. We also get to choose of our beverages of our choice which has an extensive tea list, coffee and ice chocolate to boot for the kids. I chose a weekday to have high tea and it was very relaxing accompanied by a pianist tickling the ivories with popular tunes. All-in-all a delightful birthday celebration."
Wonderful Weekday Tea,Early bday celebration at the Tea Lounge. A pleasant weekday afternon tea. The service was extraordinary and the food was exquisite. Let the hotel know at booking if you have any dietary requirements. They are happy to advise and make arrangements if possible. Thank you Jade Jennifer and Wendy for making it a special bday tea for me.
Lovely Place,Nice place for afternoon tea. The service is warm. The music is just nice for a chit chat session. Very Beautiful place for Instagram!
Great Scones and Good Service!,"Lovely Hi-Tea!

The Staffs were very friendly and professional. Girly, Mel and a Korean Girl (Sorry i forgot her name) took great care of us. I was seated at a middle table which was in between 2 groups of people but Girly sense my discomfort and she moved us to the corner of the tea lounge.

Food was good with many choices from Western to Asian. The Scones were amazing which is my favorite. The Chef came out and serve one round of this cold tomato in a glass of ice (the tomato is so good!).

Great place for Hi-Tea and spend the weekend away."
"Excellent High Tea but let down by the supervisor, Alice","We really enjoyed the food and the selection of food at the High Tea at the Regent. The service from the waiting staff was also excellent. The disappointment was the way we were dealt with by the Alice, the supervisor in the Tea Lounge.
As you can see from the photos, the variety for the Spanish style High Tea was excellent; everything was extremely well presented and cooked to perfection. Although the tea was limited to two pots, that was more than enough for us with the outside temperature in the 30s so we enjoyed lots of water too.
However, we had booked via the website with a special offer for booking directly. The offer was processed and accepted by the Regent‚Äôs website and when we arrived no mention was made of the offer not being available. It was not until the end of our High Tea when Alice, the supervisor, presented us with the incorrect bill that we were told the offer wasn‚Äôt available on that date. Now these things happen but it was the unfortunate manner in which it was dealt with by Alice - no apology I‚Äôm really sorry about that but just a ‚Äúno offer today, now pay the bill‚Äù reaction.
When we went to pay, there was a problem with the card reader which she took out on her junior member of staff who had been so helpful and polite but who she was really rude to. In fact, it was the card reader issue and the other card reader worked fine.
This was truly a let down by Alice alone in circumstances where everything else was so good! Sadly it means we won‚Äôt be back."
Lovely lobby lounge with live piano music,High tea spot is lovely to one side of the lobby. We really enjoyed the lovely live piano music. The 3 tier table service gives that authentic traditional high tea feel. Plus various buffet items. A glass of bubbly as well as the coffee/tea completed the lovely afternoon.
Good,"A nice placeto ejoy your time with your family , drinking tea or celebrating the cakes of birthday, but the service ia not talented"
Afternoon tea at the Regent (3.5/5),"I have had the afternoon tea at the Regent‚Äôs Tea Lounge several times over the years. It‚Äôs the place I would go to for a special treat and a t√™te-√†-t√™te with a pal. It‚Äôs even been a ‚Äúhappy place‚Äù when our spirits were low and we needed a quiet place to commiserate over tea. So it was with this in mind that I picked this place to celebrate an old colleague‚Äôs birthday in end-May.

As there was a Japanese ‚Äúharu‚Äù/Êò•/spring theme, most of the items had a Japanese twist. Some of the desserts were very cutely decorated too.

We were given a very spacious and comfortable corner, and there was a pianist nearby who played soothing tunes at regular intervals.

The service staff were very attentive - in fact, almost over-the-top. A long-serving staff posed for numerous photos with us when she discovered we were celebrating a birthday. Of course, my friend was pleasantly surprised when she was presented with a lovely slice of birthday cake with a lighted candle (check out the photo).

The Chinese chef from the restaurant Basilico came and chatted with us too, appearing later with small servings of his popular Hokkien Mee, a local favourite of fried noodles. It was a very kind and thoughtful gesture, as the items we were served and those on display for further selection, though dainty and well-presented, were in my opinion, sadly of a limited range.

I really cannot fault the quality of food, ambience, and service at the Tea Lounge. However, I usually pick this venue on a weekday if I can help it, precisely because I prefer the typical English afternoon tea served with warm scones and generous servings of delectable sandwiches such as the quintessential salmon or cucumber sandwiches. I‚Äôm not someone looking for anything ‚Äúfusion‚Äù or local, as those are readily available elsewhere, especially the ubiquitous full-blown buffets around the island.

So while I‚Äôm glad my friend enjoyed herself (thankfully), I was rather disappointed by what was served. This is of course merely a matter of personal opinion, and this is afterall Asia. However, what it means for me is that I will no longer be able to get my ‚Äúfix‚Äù at the Regent and must continue my search or look farther afield whenever I crave a ‚Äúproper‚Äù English afternoon tea. I must also remember to make time for and cherish my afternoon tea at the various tea lounges whenever I‚Äôm back in London!"
tea for 2,just had tea with my favourite daughter in law. we loved the cakes there. and the cream puffs are to die for.
Delectable Spread,"The 3 of us had Hi-Tea at Tea lounge on 1st June.
We enjoyed the food, esp the special seasoned tomatoes & laksa.

Kudos to the pastry team led by Chef Alex.
We enjoyed the pastry creations esp the cutesy strawberry cheesecake, tofu cheesecake, macarons and chocolates.

We also enjoyed the wide variety of tea."
Scrumptious High Tea from Savoury to Sweets,"I have been to Tea Lounge for a few times and never once I was disappointed. Service was great, good was fantastic and occasionally you will be surprised by some Asian dishes like Hokkien Mee or Char Siew Meat. There is a pianist beside the lounge playing soothing music. It was fantastic.Highly recommended!"
Relaxing and enjoyable Afternoon Tea,My 2nd visit for their Haru in Tokyo theme afternoon tea. The usual impeccable service from all the staffs. One of the best scones and paired with the yuzu cream is simply heavenly. Will be back before the theme ends in June
Excellent food and service,"Excellent variety of food, excellent service by staff. Highly recommend. apart from the spread there are specials being dished out by chefs"
"Nice food, Great service",It was my first time trying the high tea at Regent hotel yesterday. We were impressed by the wide selection of dishes. The buffet spread includes some seasonal Japanese snacks. We loved everything especially the freshly made scones! Thank you Mauro and your team for the wonderful experience.
Be inspired at the Regent‚Äôs afternoon tea buffet,"For all afternoon tea lovers, don‚Äôt miss a chance to visit the Regent Singapore hotel as they offer one of the best afternoon tea experience in town."
Exceptional service by Priscilla,We decided to visit regent for late night supper thinking food will be served till 1 am. However we arrived 10 mins passed the last order timing at 11.15pm. Priscilla our waitress was very very nice to help us get our order or wine and burger through. Thank you for your service.
A nice afternoon,Enjoyed an afternoon of relaxation! The food is good and ambiance is nice too. The staff were attentive. A great place to catch up with friends. Will definitely go again.
Absolutely worth the price.,Friendly and efficient servers who obliged us with helpings of cherry tomatoes on ice and char siew. Loved the cavier and smoked salmon. Beef rump with Yorkshire pudding was also a delight. Yuzu puffs and cheng tng with infused lemon had me for a few helpings.
Weekday afternoon tea set is Disappointing,"The food was cold and unappetizing. The scones are just okay and cold. The dessert choice is limited. Overall, it is not worth the value. The weekend afternoon buffet is more worth it."
