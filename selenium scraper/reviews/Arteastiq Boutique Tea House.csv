Glorious brunch,Service crew quite attentive. Brunch set delightful and worth the cost. Great street view of Orchard road. Cozy ambiance on a weekday afternoon.
Just the Two of us,Perfect place for a High-Tea. A nice location overlooking Orchard Road. Was a little disappointed as the Local high tea set was not available so we decided to order only one Western high tea set and the rest is just add on. My favorite will definitely be the Ice tea desserts which goes well with the hot weather. Overall best food and service throughout.
Unique high tea ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,Excellent service. Very nice ambiance. Had the luscious afternoon high tea. Definitely not disappointing. I was skeptical of the bad review but the menu was irresistible so I just had to try it for myself. Every bite is a party in your mouth. I‚Äôm not big on high tea but this one is worthy of a high praise and two thumbs up. Wide selection of tea and unique cookies. Will definitely return for more
My fav high tea spot!,"Enjoyed the afternoon tea here. Their lychee tea is my absolute favourite. Refreshing, sweet and light. Love the atmosphere at Jewel, such a great place to just chill and relax."
Great experiences,"I was there a week ago, and honestly this place is one of the highlight of my short visit in Sinagpore. Will definitely be back."
Service sucks,"We ordered 4 dishes and 4 lychee tea, total spending was $153.
When we asked them for table water, they commented that they will only serve one glass of plain water for one drink we ordered from the menu. We were also told that dinning duration was 90min. What we are not happy about is their service staff are unfriendly and rude. When we requested for one plain water to be refilled, we were rejected. Next, they simply brought the bill to us in a way to chase us out. Now, whilst we can understand that the dining duration is limited, the staff should politely handed us the bill. Next, I‚Äôm wondering if it is costly to have refill a glass of plain water. I‚Äôm not sure what was their concern, if by refilling our plain water would mean we will mingle longer then this is uncalled for as we were limited to 90min of dinning. What‚Äôs worst is that, both my friend and I had tummy upset after our meal there. While the food is not bad, their service sucks."
Horrible service from staff,"I fully agree with the other review that their staff were absolutely discourteous. We were a group of 6 and ordered 2 tea time sets (for 4 pax) with 2 additional drinks and small bites. However, when we asked for warm water, the staff actually insisted that they could only serve a total of 5 cups of water as we only ordered 5 pots of tea. We rationalised that we‚Äôve ordered other drinks that weren‚Äôt tea and ordered more than enough food too. However they were inflexible and unapologetic about not serving us an additional cup of water. Yes this sounds trivial but I do not get their logic? it is also unbelievable that any self respecting and reputable place would be this calculative over a glass of water.

Besides that, the food was lackluster and but really, nothing beats the sulky and rude service staff. This place needs to do better."
This is my forth time at Arteastiq,This is my forth time at Arteastiq came here 3 times for afternoon tea and once for dinner. They seem to have slight redecorate the window seats by adding white curtains. Previously they accepted reservation by now they don‚Äôt only walk in. Their afternoon tea seem to be same and they did not change their pastries or sweets only very slight change. It would be good if they could change and rotate their afternoon so that customers will keep coming back to try different afternoon tea themed or flavors. But overall for the price of $48 ++ for 2 persons is quite reasonable the setting was nice and their famous lychee tea great!
Staff is discourteous,"Didn‚Äôt really have a good time. We were very disappointed with the service and unfriendly staff. Afternoon tea set is just a so so ,definitely not filling. Ambiance is good though."
"Food was good, service can be improved","Went on a weekday afternoon for lunch. Was informed that there is a max 1.5 hrs dining period. Service was mediocre, servers had a nonchalant attitude. Drink was plonked down without a word. Squid ink pasta and iced lychee tea was good though."
Lunch with Tea,"A nice and cosy place for lunch or dinner. It can be packed at times. Service was rather good and we had the following: Lychee tea, ginger spiced tea, Viking Prime Frikadel and Boston Love Boat. If you feel in a playful and artistic mood you can try their next door area and have a go at painting."
Great time,I love the service and great meal. Enjoying my day in singapore. Staff good and food delicious teas very very nice. Great evening there
Bridal shower: High Tea and Art Jamming,"It was a special day for my friend who is the Bride to Be. We decided for Arteastiq because you get to eat and at the same location.

I called to make reservation for 4 pax on the 15th Dec.
I am 5 mths pregnant so being concerned about whether they could switch out some High Tea Menu items for me, so I thought it was best to call instead of waiting for email response.

The staff who answered took my reservation and set it at 2.30pm. She also ensured me that I could request for the High Tea menu item change on that day itself.
I was also concerned about whether i could reserve timeslots for Art jamming so that we will have slots after we had our High tea.
Staff responded that we don't need a timeslot. We can go for art jamming anytime after our meal.
I double checked before ending the call.

On 15th Dec, I arrived at Arteastiq Mandarin Gallery, before 2.30pm, on time.
To our horror, there was no reservation under my name.

The staff doesn't look happy. Thank goodness there was slots and we had our high tea anyway. *phew* Think about how our day would have been ruined if it was fullhouse!

‚òÖFood‚òÖ

Remembered I called to ask if they could switch out some items to fit my pregnancy diet? I didn't even mind if they swap with some cheaper items....

However? Staff who served us on that day said that it is not possible to switch out items. She can try to switch out if the same item in the set gets swapped together.

(1 set is meant for 2 pax)

I didn't want any of my friends to waste their money when all the good stuffs gets switched out. ( Foie Gras, Salmon tataki, Pineapple mochi)
So in the end, there was 3 items I couldn't eat in the set. I did the swapping with my friends and that they could at least enjoy what I shouldn't be eating.

High tea menu items does look presentable.
Rose tea was good match with the cookies. The Earl grey rose cookie tasted the best amg others.

There was some attitude problem with the staffs seriously.
She told us that we must place our drinks by the side table so that the high tea set can be served. It was at all in a friendly tone. It sounded like an order to all of us.

Anyway, we were really thirsty so we brought the drinks close to us anyway.
The high tea set they placed by the side table, we brought it close to us too. The High tea set could fit on our table, together with the drinks set, with NO ISSUES.

So what about the High Tea Menu Quality?
I would give a 5/10. The items were creatively put together. They were presentable, but they do not taste good.

I had a couple of High tea experiences in Japan and also at Singapore's prestige Atlas bar. Arteastiq is just not the right place to have high tea. There's definitely better options out there.

‚òÖArt Jamming‚òÖ

The experience we had is like heaven compared to slightly-hellish at the dining section.

The staff was really friendly. She offered to bring me another chair seeing that I was pregnant. She also explained in detail how the pricing works and then helped us with our apron.

It was because of her, our experience with Arteastiq was saved. Our day was saved too.

Please give her a praise and a raise because she deserves it!!"
Tea Break,"Had a pleasant afternoon at Arteastiq Boutique Tea House. Great place to catch up in a beautifully decorated environment. The afternoon tea set was equally aesthetically served with the tea of our choices. The Lychee Tea is really awesome and highly recommended. One of the few places with a long list of tea selections from various countries.
This place is along Orchard Road and easily accessible, a good pit stop when you are in town area."
Unbelivable,The food is awful. Teas are with sugar even if there is no mention of it in the menu. The furniture is scratchy and the staff is drying the cutlery in front of you while you eat. Don‚Äôt go there!
Delicious üòã,Had a nice lunch of duck confit sandwich and sambal sea bass laksa. Food was a little salty but overall great. Service was good too :)
Overall:3/5 Location:4/5 Environment:,"Overall:3/5 Location:4/5 Environment: 3/5, a bit dirty and lack of cleaning Food:4/5 Price: 3/5, a bit on the higher average"
Just Okay,This place is good for a good catchup with a friend but not really that good for their teas. They have an extensive menu of teas but I felt it was too expensive for what they offered.
Brunch,Very nice ambience and food! Love the Laksa Seabass Fish and Lychee Tea are great! Will pay a visit again!
Girls gathering,Nice ambience for gathering . Lychee tea is so awesome . This is my second time here . I had the salmon Wellington and black ink squid pasta . Portion is huge .
Great food and ambience,Good food and ambience. We ordered the beef bolognese in shell pasta and prawn fettucine with mantau. Had a slight spice to it. Nice drinks and reasonable price. quiet and conducive for dates.
Good place for brunch.,"Relaxing ambience, good food, and nice music... Perfect for couple, friends or family gathering/hangout."
Sophisticated,Drink was great with cozy ambience ! This is a place which is suitable for couple and bestie to hang out .Will be back again :)
Nice,Nice place for a brunch & afternoon tea Good environment for taking photo or for a dating...worth for the price also

Dinner,Squid ink pasta was good. The salted egg fried chicken thigh sauce was tasty. 1 for 1 drink promotion was wodth it.
Good Ambience,Good selection of tea and good ambience :) Such a nice place to chill on a Sunday with friends and family!
Great Arvo Getaway!,"Hidden at the corner of Mandarin Gallery, with a great view of the the main Orchard Rd. Attentive staff who offered us a window seats when we didn‚Äôt asked for it."
Wonderful place,"Excellent service, friendly staff, good food and just overall lovely ambiance. Would definitely bring my loved ones back! Thank you so much!"
Nice ambience,"Enjoyable and delicious tea, food & ambience. I will come back again to try the rest of the menu. Great to have a new hang out at Orchard Road."
Nice food and ambiance,"the food is worth for the price and the ambiance is good, very relaxing but the food of high tea serve is quite little."
Nice tea and ambiamce,Lovely place for a friend gathering. The high tea set is highly recommended. Nice ambiance. Location is in the orchard so it is super convenient after a day of shopping.
"Good food, nice ambience","Food is good, ambience is nice but a little pricey. Overall is good and is a very chill place to relax."
Delicious food and great ambience.,"We came in for lunch, what a treat! I ordered the Cold Soba Noodle Salad and a Hot Mint Lemongrass Tea. My husband ordered the Thai Chicken, with Spicy Ginger Tea.

The 'buzzer' system means you can request service, when ready. The food and drinks came quickly, and were delicious. The dressing was on the side of the salad, which is my preference.

A great little find."
Delightful evening at Arteastiq,Brought my little one and wife to Arteastiq for dinner. Good service and plenty of space for my little gal to move around and explore. Had an enjoyable evening.
Nice environment,"The food here is good, very relaxing environment. There is wide range of tea selection here. We enjoyed a lot"
Great food & ambience,"Love the lychee tea, great balance between tea & fruit! Champagne vanilla ice cream was awesome too!"
Lychee Tea still good!,"Been a while since I last had the Arteastiq ‚Äòs signature lychee tea. Still taste as good as when I first tried some years back. (Still as pricey ÔºâKiddos ordered Sea shells pasta bolognese sauce and the Kebaya: a re-interpretation of satay and laksa. Both did not disappoint although the ketupat can be fresher/softer, satay sauce can taste better.....

All in all, a fun outing for the kids where Jr Junior did a speed art jam (90 mins) as the studio closes at 9pm."
Nice ambient and great place to chill out,Serving nice tea and sinful dessert. Service is good too. Warm and blissful environment suitable for relaxing and refreshing.
Amazing vibes,"Amazing vibes and fantastic food. We came here on a busy Sunday. Seated by the windows, amazing view of Orchard road"
Lovely place for hi tea,Nice ambience with awesome lychee tea. The peranakan hi-tea is instagramable. Nice place to visit with friends.
Great service,Attentive to our needs and good service! Love the high tea here. Ambience is good. It‚Äôs family friendly and no waiting time needed on a weekend.
Great Place For Afternoon Tea,"Super awesome iced lychee drinks, not to mention their tasty otah fries and honey fried mid-wings. Definitely a great chill out place to spend your afternoon in."
Great food,Great food but average service. Will come back if given the opportunity. Beautiful ambience and nice choice of music.
Excellent food,"Love the lychee tea here!! Ambience is nice, good for gatherings or celebrations. Would recommend to try the duck confit wrap and also chilli crab sauce pasta!"
Great place to hangout,A great place to hang out with friends! Great ambience :) definitely a place that we will come again!
Afternoon tea,"Lovely ambiance, my kids love the Mao San wang ice cream! Osmanthus tea & the Irish coffee with ice cream are worth a try and its a good place to hang out with friends."
Great Ambience and Awesome Brunch,Good variety of tea selection with nice ambience and great food. We had a fun loving afternoon chilling and relaxing. The art jamming session are something not to be miss as well!
Good ambience great drink,Good place to chill and relax over a cup of tea and desserts with you love one. But to be sure to make a reservation as it‚Äôs usually full in the day.
Signature High tea,Nice ambience with great selection of teas! Prefer their savory food than the desserts though. Would recommend for dating couples looking for a nice place to hang out.
High tea,The ambience of the environment itself is very quiet and calming. Theyre high tea set for two people is great!
Desserts!,"Really great desserts, albeit a little on the sweeter side. Amazing yuzu macaron and crepes! Would come again for the lychee tea!"
Mrs,"Really cozy place for afternoon tea and with the good food, want to come back here again Really recomended for enjoy tea"
Bad quality hi tea,"Ordered hi tea set for two .
Lychee n red date tea was great esp the biscuits .

Mochi-Extremely dry and was hard .
(Actual texture should be soft n chewy )
When approached staff and enquire -her reply was they kept it in the fridge n it‚Äôs that way only .totally non apologetic.hiring staffs are difficult these days but bad staffing are just as bad .
We did not expect to pay and not get at least decent food ."
Lovely afternoon,It was a lovely lunch for both of us. We had the duck confit and basil chicken and blended coffee. It was so good !
Good food and ambience,Really chill place for family and friends without breaking the bank! The food here is really good. Would definitely come again.
Bad Experience at the window seat- Blazing Sun from 2.30pm to 5.30pm. No blinds/shades,"My friends and I were looking forward to spend a nice, leisurely and comfortable afternoon in the restaurant. However, the whole experience was a very uncomfortable one. We were seated near the window and sat uncomfortably throughout the afternoon tea as we were hit by the glare from the afternoon blazing sun. In fact, all the diners who were sitting near the window were all affected. We were feeling very hot and uncomfortable to have the afternoon tea in such a hot and blazing setting. It would be good and appropriate gesture that Arteastiq should provide blinds/shades for the diners. It was definitely an unpleasant setting for the 3 of us as we couldn't wait to finish our food and drink and get out of the place.We will never come to this restaurant again especially from 3.30 pm to 5.30pm. All diners please be aware."
High tea,"I drink high tea with my aunt, i try the western set. It‚Äôs nice, not very sweet and the tea is nice also"
Lychee Tea is our favourite beverage,"Our favourite bonding restaurant whenever we are in Singapore. Lovely ambiance, excellent foods and refreshing Lychee Tea"
Ungracious and calculating,"Water must be a luxe commodity to this company - Won‚Äôt serve water unless orders are placed, won‚Äôt refill either. We ordered a main course, a high tea set, 3 dessert plates, 5 sets of tea and we can‚Äôt be served a refill of water in small glasses. We won‚Äôt be back - service is very calculating, ungracious and lacking any warmth. Food isn‚Äôt so top notch for such arrogance."
Nice tea cafe,"Having my high tea time with my friends , all the tea was premium and tasty , the dessert is cute with nice plating and yes the taste is amazing, and you can also have time to do a little bit of painting ,nice place to chill"
Lovely afternoon,"Ordered the Irish cream blended drink it was so delicious and yummy. The duck toast was just ok, the sides were burnt so I wasn‚Äôt too pleased about that. The prawn fettuccine was delicious but the bun was too hard. Service is just ok."
Birthday afternoon tea,"Do not order the afternoon tea set. The food is poor quality, looks good but does not taste good at all!!!! Venue is nice but staff very unfriendly. They clearly do not enjoy their jobs."
Nice cafe si artistic,"Love everything here!! The view, ambience, tea, desserts, meal üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº , so unique here, we also can do painting"
High tea,"Pastries, desserts with tea. Ambience is good though food is average. Service is good. Many tea choices available"
Number one cafe in Singapore!,"Tasty. View. Mood. Music... Everything is the best! Every dining, tea and dessert menu are so nice! Must try duck confit sandwich! ÎßõÍπ°Ìå®, Î∑∞Íπ°Ìå®, Î∂ÑÏúÑÍ∏∞ Íπ°Ìå®!"
So nice,"Lovely food and nice ambience. Service was good today. Thank you very much we enjoyed it. I especially love the basil chicken rice, it was so good !"
Slow service and awful food,Service is slow. Ordered salad and dessert. Interesting that they choose to serve the dessert before salad and their dessert is awful. Will never come here again.
Average,"Had lunch at the new outlet in Jewel, Changi Airport. The place was rather cramped. Since only me and my husband, they put us next to the kitchen area. It was Sunday and was crowded. Anyway, the food not bad and they have quite many selection of tea. The price is on the high side. But honestly it was not worth. I don't mind pay higher $$$ but we get comfy. But on that day was quite disappointed, the place was over crowded, our seating place was very uncomfortable and very noisy with the staff up and down taking order from the kitchen."
Good place,Nice Ambience in plaza Singapore! Great place to hang out with friends. Nice food selection too.....
Instagram worthy and little else,"Booked a table at the window for a Sunday brunch. Two tables were empty though I was repeatedly reminded at booking ""We can't promise."" On arrival, we were told the table number and none if the servers made effort to show us where it was till asked. The coffee served on a fancy tray with two look-like-macha cookies would be a wow! if server took extra step to introduce what they are. An hour later, we learnt from another server who clearly spoke better English that they are in fact 'nasi lemak' cookies!! That caused an eruption of WOW!!!! now we are interested to try the green cookies that were pushed aside. Seat and side table appear to lack proper cleaning. Latte served was not hot enough. Service is generally sub-par both at Mandarin Gallery and Jewel. Water is a whopping five bucks and a reminder why Wild Honey downstairs remains an all-time favourite in its generous supply of free bottled water. Mushroom burger with sweet potato fries was average. Laksa noodles were overdone for dry noodles and lumpy. Seabass was okay. Overall, a place to show on social media and little else."
Tea & chilling. Unexpected chicken & waffles. So-so service.,"More of a place to chill out and chit chat with friends. The menu is extensive. Especially the drinks. A thick booklet of choices.
The service is only so-so because some are somber and some are chirpy. An average on the whole.
I was seated near the windows. The chairs are comfy but the tables are like knee high. I don‚Äôt know what to do what my legs. They can go under the table so I had to spread my legs wide open to eat. Not the most elegant if you wear a skirt. Luckily I wore pants. Another lady shown to these seats asked to change due to the uncomfortable height. I mean there‚Äôs a view but it‚Äôs not comfortable to sit there for a meal. Better at a proper table. I suppose if you‚Äôre having a drink only, such low table would be ok.
I was craving chicken & waffles. So that‚Äôs what I came to have. At $17++ it‚Äôs not cheap.
When it came, I was surprised albeit a little disappointed at the unexpected. It was like a chicken salad on top of a waffle.
The taste is not bad. The salad had a lime citrus flavor, a bit tangy so it wasn‚Äôt too heavy. The chicken portion is actually quite little. They chopped it up so you cant actually tell how much chicken it is but there aren‚Äôt many pieces.
There‚Äôs some syrup on the side and butter.
The waffle is soft and fluffy. Not bad. It‚Äôs just the whole tower of chicken salad over waffle. I was abit unsure what to do..
I wouldn‚Äôt mind coming back if there‚Äôs a discount promotion and I‚Äôm in the area. The ambience can be a bit loud with many people chattering at the same time though. Not a tranquil place if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for. Can be quite pricey."
Very affordable place for afternoon tea and great ambiance,I came here more then once to enjoy their afternoon tea. Prices are very affordable and I love their ice lychee tea it was a comfortable place for a relaxing Saturday afternoon to have afternoon tea. Will definitely visit again.
Brunch time,"Highly recommended for breakfast and brunch, didn‚Äôt check their dinner menu. They have a good selection of tea."
Hightea Review,Nice food and tea. But surprise to be chase away as we can only have the table for 2 hours for weekend. Could be better if they prealert us.
Pretty good,Comfortable chairs. Reasonable price. Place looks arteastic. Good service. It gives you that special cosy feeling as you step into this place!
Enjoyable!,Great place with good service with presentable food. Lots of food and tea selection. Highly recommended!
Really rude service!,"I was invited for a birthday treat at Arteastiq and was rather thrilled about it as I have heard about this restaurant. Was impressed with the decor upon arrival but it stopped there. My experience went downhill all the way because of one rude staff named Ling. She seemed to be a senior waitress but she was definitely the worst, even the part-timers and junior staff did a better job than her. She was arrogant and almost forced me to drink up my coffee when I told her that it was not what I had expected. She literally argued! She did not even offer to make the coffee a little stronger, merely implying to me to drink it or leave it. Whatever was served after that could not make up for such atrocious attitude. She spoilt my day! She's definitely in the wrong job. I would not return to such a restaurant nor recommend it to anyone."
Late lunch,"Nicest food ever :) love it !
We had ginseng tea, which was so fragrant and sweet; chilli crab fettuccine- serving could be more and duck sandwich- our favourite ! Dessert was Mont Blanc- was okay but pricey. All in all I loved it :) thank you"
Rude staff,"We were there at the plaza Singapura branch in a group. We wanted more tea for our lychee tea, the service staff were reluctant. Why? They say you are not supposed to have refills because people abuse the system. They ordered one pot and share among the whole group. But we did not and it is obvious, each of us had ordered one pot. We wanted more water, because it was too sweet and we just wanted to dilute the tea. The staff reluctantly did it, and another staff returned and explained, and said that she got scolded for that.
I said i wanted more milk for my hot chocolate, and the staff asked ""is the hot chocolate too sweet too"" in a sarcarstic way.
My friend could not take diary product, she asked before ordering, but when the food came she noticed that something was not right and asked the service staff. Again some discussion went on among themselves at the back. Another came back and grabbed the bowl back to the kitchen. No explaination given.
Not very professional bunch of service staff.
Food was ok, cookies are not too bad."
Chic,Nice ambience. Good service. I had the prawn fettuccine with the cold lychee tea. The lychee tea was refreshing and invigorating. Can‚Äôt say the same for the food which was satisfactory at best. Would consider coming again for the good spread of beverages.
Fwh,Good high tea spead...nice pomelo and lychee tea.... gd chillout pl...will certainly recommend friends to the pl
Hi-tea,"Ordered
Iced Lychee tea / Pear tea / Seafood hi-tea set / Milk tea lava cake

Food quality :
Superb!

Service :
Prompt despite many diners.

Atmosphere :
Couch seats were good and interior was pretty.
Just slightly warm but manageable.

Overall :
Not the most affordable hi-tea seat but its still worth another visit. Will be back!"
Good choice for Food.,"Nice environment, friendly staff, good food and many choices for good tea and coffee. Prices very affordable."
First time visiting arteastiq,"Food is surprisingly good, portion is pretty big that probably 2 person can share a plate. although berverages are on the pricier side, there are cookies that comes along with it!"
Nice food and ambience.,"The food is fantastic and Creative. Service is not bad, simply press the button on the table for prompt service."
Atreastiq@Mandarin Gallery,"We have a pleasant dinning experience in arteastiq bontique tea house. Comfy and beautiful atmosphere, variety of food and beverages ( we like the fruits tea)! Friendly and helpful staff too."
So disappointed...,"After the various rave reviews, was expecting this to be a good choice for dinner for group of 5 on our last night in Singapore. Unfortunately not so. Food was ok to poor. None of us were able to complete our main courses. And though the restaurant was not busy (we were there at 6.30pm), the staff were more keen on talking to each other than serving us. Perhaps Arteastiq might be good for some tea, but certainly not for high tea/dinner!"
Plastic,"Very disappointing high tea set, we found some sharp plastic in our food!!! Seems like that the high tea set is not made by themselves."
Fabulous Signature Afternoon Tea Set!,A good combo of sweet & savory treats! And not forgetting my favourite lychee iced teaüòç It‚Äôs a must try. Will definitely come back again:)
The best cafe in Singapore!,Delicious foods and beverages. Plating is so nice. Nice view and interior design. It is located at the heart of Ochard road. I love this cafe.
Best lychee tea ever,We love the lychee tea. You can eat the real lychee inside the tea. It‚Äôs a gem hidden in a department store.
Arteastiq review,"First time here, cosy place with decent food. Great place for friends gathering. Staffs are friendly."
Great Food & Tea,Food is awesome here and it goes well with a tea. Would strongly recommend to visit here when you are here in Singapore.
Great food and ambience,Friendly stuff and food are delicious. Food ordered is hot and ambience is cosy and nice.. Couch seating which makes us comfortable.
Afternoon tea after walking at Orchard,Great ambience! Great spot to enjoy tea and cakes after shopping in Orchard area. Lots of selections on the premium tea. The Thai tea cake is a must try!
Celebrating Our Anniversary,Having our dinner here. Romantic feelings. Food is nice too! Must try their squid ink spaghetti and salad.
Afternoon tea,"Had their tea time set this afternoon. Nice ambience and food price is reasonable, loved the teas especially the cold lychee tea!"
Lunch,"The ambience coupled with natural lightings by the windows makes a warm welcome to anyone.
We enjoyed the food tremendously. The satay chicken was well marinated & the Assam fish was a delight. Make sure to order the teas which is refreshing & aesthetic to the eyes."
Good place to eat and drink..,"The ambience was quite nice, although the air conditioning could be a bit stronger.. The food portion was just right. I strongly recommend the Pomelo tea with Yuzu ice cream.. very refreshing and not too sour.."
