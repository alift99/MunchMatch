Very yummy food,"Such a lovely place serving Mediterranean food. Ordered the set lunch - my choice was artichoke hummus, smoked aubergine, spiced fish and grilled lamb. Absolutely yummy !"
Amazing Girls Night Out,"The ambiance was great! The moment you enter the restaurant, it gives you a very nice and romantic vibe.

The staff was super courteous and friendly. They are extremely attentive and always ask if you need anything. They are also very happy to ask for your food and service feedback.

Food-wise, super! We love the food, it was fresh, cooked to perfection, and looks very pretty. They taste awesome as well.

Overall, amazing experience and will defo go back again."
Average,"Came here for my husbands birthday. Food was average and some dishes were unavailable. Cocktails were interesting on paper, but not particularly exciting to drink. My husband had one which tasted like a lemon cold remedy with a creamy topping which curdled and looked like cottage cheese. When this was pointed out to the waiter we were told that it was normal. Ambience was ‘club/bar vibe’…not somewhere you’d go for a special meal sadly."
Very tasty food and great service,"Came here as a family of 4 for an early dinner and was not disappointed. We got the last 2 steak tartare's of the day (which was a bit of a worry since we booked at 5:30pm!) and ordered some other plates. Not a single morsel of food was left. It was probably a bit more expensive that I had anticipated but the quality of the food was fantastic.
Our waiter was fantastic too. It was his first day and you would have never have guessed it."
Dinner with friends,"Food was very delicious and well prepared! Service on the other side was less good - the team was not very attentive, forgot items we ordered and we always had to wave with our hands as no one really checked in our table, even though the restaurant was not really full. They were nice when we asked for something."
Excellent set lunch menu,"Food is delicious, service excellent and personable and ambience comfortable. The set lunch is great value for money."
Brunch fun!!,"Third time at this fantastic place Loved the set brunch menu...mango cocktail was perfectly matched Awesome vibe here, relaxed and fun Best staff eva!!"
Ok. But definitely overpriced...,Central location. We did not have a reservation but managed to get a table anyway. Staff were friendly. Food was ok but shockingly overpriced. $25 for a very small amount of wine was way too expensive even for Singapore context...
Poor Management,Management should look into their table booking process. Completely ruined our special occasion evening with family. Very poor experience.
Great ambience but very little food,"Good ambience, yellow lights and very good looking set up but the extremely disappointing to see the menu… particularly for vegetarians. Also, out of a very limited menu… few things were not available. So it was just about compulsion and not choice. Also, the portion sizes are terribly small that you start to feel cheated when you compare to the price. We had to go to another place for dinner. Not recommended if want to grab a bit.. definitely not for vegetarians. Get a drink.. may be."
Experience in Fat Prince,"Hi Fat Prince Team,

I have been to Fat Prince may times and used to enjoy the lunch set in the affordable price. For an occasion I have invited three of my friends (only two can make it on the day) and found food was not upto that par. Falafel was very hard and had a different smell on the day. Have informed the staff as well and hope he has given the feedback.

Still, I find Fat Prince is a very good place to eat and enjoyed my previous times there."
DELICIOUS AND EXCELLENT SERVICE,The food are delicious and all the service crew service are excellent in what they are doing to service us!
"Great ambience, good food - marred by careless impersonal service","Fat Prince Valentine's Day special offering looked very intriguing. I was looking forward to a romantic evening and an enjoyable dining experience with my date.

When we arrived, the waitstaff immediately poured us two glasses of cold water from an amphora, which was a nice touch. I would later found out this was added to the bill without any kind of notification or option, but the price wasn't unreasonable, and they did keep the glasses filled all night, so not a big deal.

We decided to kick off our evening with two glasses of champagne. A waitress took our order, and we settled in to the delightful ambiance. Presently, another waiter asked if we were ready to order the food component of the dinner, so we made our choices from the set menu.

Here's where things started to go off the rails. Our glasses of champagne still had not arrived when the first food items were delivered. This was a bit irritating, as we'd hoped to enjoy a nice glass of bubbles before our meal. We decided to sit and wait until the drinks arrived. After another five minutes or so, the glasses of champagne arrived ... along with two other cocktails(!) The cocktails were part of the set menu, but for some reason the waitstaff decided to serve all the drinks at once?! So now our idea of having two chill glasses of champagne before dinner had become a crowded table of drinks and the first course of the food. This put pressure on us to get through the champagne. A fumble, early on. I don't understand why the waitstaff didn't foresee this - or at least could have asked us what we'd like to do?

The starters were excellent. For the mains we both ordered the wagyu steak, and I noted we weren't asked at any point as how we'd like our steaks done. Perhaps the chef mandates the way the steak will be prepared, and in any case, I was happy with the (rare) doneness. So I'm happy to let that one slide. Unfortunately, despite being well-cooked, the steak was over-salted, which made finishing it difficult. To give credit where credit is due, the mashed potato was gorgeous - probably my favourite item of the night.

The dessert was extremely rich, and neither my date and I were able to finish it. This probably speaks to personal taste more than anything, as I don't eat a lot of sweets.

We decided to try a couple more of the cocktails, and duly ordered. After 30 mins they still hadn't arrived. We left, in dampened spirits - and not really feeling like we'd been looked after at all. What a pity."
Wonderful dining experience again!,"We had a great CNY experience at the Fat Prince. Friendly, informative staff who are both professional yet make the whole dining experience fun & memorable. The food is just amazing. I am vegan & there is lots to choose from. The cocktails are equally as fabulous & there is a varied wine list to choose from. Can not wait to go again. Thank you to all the staff for another fun night !"
Average food and poor service,The restaurant doesn’t seem to be very well run. Poor service and staff can’t help explain the food choices and quantities. Cocktails are sweet and average.
Sophisticated Middle Eastern Cuisine,Fat prince never fail to impress. Bought my friends here for holiday for dinner and the food served were spectacular. Not only that the environment was relaxing and vibrant. Fat prince is one of those restaurant that caters to all occasions.
Vibes and the lamb was great!,"We went there as a date night, ordered the 36 hours smoked lamb, was superb! And the ambiance was romantic and fun. Great service! Just that the drunk customer next table was a bit too loud but understandable."
Okay food,"I had made a reservation at this restaurant which we had heard a lot about. The place was bustling and it gave us a good feeling. We were escorted to our table, where we ordered (everything) from the menu sans drinks. The food took a bit of time in arriving, but we managed to keep ourselves entertained. Menu is simple and the portion sizes are quite okay from an individual serving point of view. The pita was nice and so were some of the items we ordered. The presentation of the food was nice. The lamb tartare was a bit too sour. Cauliflower could have been cooked a bit longer to make it flavorful, mint dipping sauce was nice. The chef special chicken pita was nice and crispy. I guess the overall flavours were not really to our liking."
Bring back the old menu,"the updated menu it very over priced, service was very slow. Great atmosphere but with the current menu and its pricing I ll not be returning"
Terrible New Menu,"Dinner for 4 people, the service was terrible had to ask for water and drinks many times during the meal. The new menu is just aweful, i have been going to fat prince on and off for over 5 years and the old menu of small turkish wraps was great, good value and the food tasted delicious, the new menu will see you only being able to order the LAMB PORTERHOUSE ($22 per 100g) at 1.2kg peice..... thats $264!!!!! or the PIT SMOKED PORK RIBEYE ($31 per 100g) at only 600g a portion ($186). They did not allow you to order a smaller amount of meat so left us having to only have one main to share between the 4 of us. it was not worth the money at all. We ordered the Pork Ribeye and this came with only 6 pitas and was barely enough for the four of us as a main after 5 small dishes.

My advise to the chef is to change the menu back as this menu only works for large groups where you can share these super expensive mains.

i would not recommend this restaurant."
Never Again,"Came here on a recommendation! NEVER AGAIN. Food was atrocious, the ribs were just fat, hardly any meat. We ordered several dishes from the starter menu, had to ask on numerous occasions to remind them that dishes were missing, I actually ended up eating alone as my colleagues had finished there’s. Selection poor, service also poor. Couldn’t get out quick enough and ended up ordering a takeaway at the end of our evening.

Can safely say I will never attend again."
Fabulous night out,"It's been a while since we ate at The Fat Prince, and it didn't disappoint. The menu has changed a litte and it was super easy to order food to share for our party of 4. The service was faultless and friendly. Will definitely be back."
All expectations met,"From the moment we arrived the service was exceptional. Then we ordered extensively from the menu, not one bad dish from crab to meat. Complimented by very good cocktails. Cool music that sets off the place. Highly recommended."
Good food but small quantity,"The food portions were very small, though they were of good quality. For 2 ladies, our total bill came up to $110 but we had to grab a bite again somewhere else. Service was OK but slightly pushy, frequently asking if we wanted to order more and clearing our plates the moment we finished. The winning point is the ambience, it was a very pretty restaurant."
Excellent service and ambience,The staffs are nice and professional. They treat their customers really well. The ambience is good and cozy with good food. :)
Good food !,"Ordered set lunch and Good food nice ambience , service is good too! Overall 4+ stars !! Will go back again !"
Great food and staff,"Super friendly staff , efficient service and amazing food!
Fairly quiet, good ambiance; not too loud. Amazing cocktail selection and revisited mezze!"
Bad experience,only allowed to sit outside. Lamb price is per 100g. But unable to customize the total weight we want is a cons. The waiter told us the weight is 800g. which is too expensive. One of the famous dish also not available during my reservation for birthday celebration with my gf.
Hippy Restaurant that serve Great Food!,"I really enjoy my time in Fat Prince. Staff are friendly, food is great and ambience amazing. Great for celebrating friends birthday and doing gathering. Even the parking is easily available across the road."
Highly recommended,"The manager was very considerate, the crew were friendly. I love the ambiance, the food esp the cauliflower. Overall, iam satisfied with their services and food."
Great dining experience!,"Scrumptious meal, especially the artichoke hummus and lamb poterhouse!
Good ambience with great service experience from Russell! Thank you for your attentiveness and friendly service!"
Excellent food loved it!!,We went there during lunch and all the kebabs we tried were excellent and flavorful and the service by Hazman was also top quality. Even the wines were reasonably priced as as add-on with the lunch menu. Will go back again soon. Keep up the good work guys.
Fat bill & thin food,"There is something wrong with the understanding of Middle eastern cuisine served here. If the idea is to have cold cuts as Adana kebab, then the cuisine has to be renamed as fusion middle eastern or similar.
The portion size of the starters are bite sized. Baba ganoush is served before the bread, so you sit and wait for the dish to turn cold until the bread comes. Pita bread is called Pede here. Medium
Sized prawns are charged as tiger prawns for $25. Overly priced for what you get. The menu is limited, if you are hungry you have to order 80-90% of the menu because the portion size wouldn’t suffice for the price u pay.
Turning a coffee shop to a restaurant is a good idea. What is more important is to get the facts and cuisne and variety right."
"Great Place for Brunch, Wonderful Atmosphere With Brilliant Service","We came for the set menu and drinks package, and absolutely loved everything about this place. The service was by far the best I've had in a long time, everyone was very attentive and relaxed. FAUZI Z our waiter was amazing and efficient. The food was just enough for us, they didn't mind holding our mains while we rested for a while! I think the mains were the best part, beautiful with loads of flavor. We've been wanting to come for a while so I'm glad we did, it was really busy which was so nice to see. we also spoke with the Lady manager (German/Australian) Who was happy to take us through the evening menu and share information about the Chef, these things will keep me coming back!"
Food was good. Service needs to be worked on.,"Food was substantial. However, service genuinely needs to be worked on. It looks like the staff don’t communicate with one another on what is and not available. Additionally, there are a few that are not well-knowledgable on the menu. When asked for recommendations they were unable to answer simple questions on portion size and more. The saving grace was that one staff member (was unable to get her name- but she was a blonde lady) was friendly and helpful."
"Great place for drinks, flatbreads and hummus","The place was packed on a Thursday night and overall we enjoyed the sharing plates of flatbread, hummus (not commonly found in Singapore) and various meats. The cocktails were also interesting - one with squid ink and stays true to the Mediterranean vibe. Not sure if it's because it's busy but it was really hard to get the service staff's attention. Place was also a little too dark to take any pictures!"
Food is very average and expect to pay way over the top!,"Visited the restaurant for a midweek dinner. Restaurant has nice decor and the staff is very attentive and provide good service.

However, the food is not as desirable as I expected. Average at best. Prices of main courses are by 100g, so can be misleading to some. We paid in excess of $250 for 2 people and to be honest I don’t think we ordered much. Do your research before visiting. At best a 5/10 restaurant."
👍,"The ambience was good , service was fantastic , and not to forget the cocktails was out of the world"
Great service!,"I used this restaurant to celebrate my friend’s birthday who has allergy to few foods.

So I requested for dietary restrictions menu and birthday cake in advance.

Their custmer service was great.
I just exchanged few emails and they understood everything I want.

My friend and I could spent a great time by thier kind and friendly assist.
Thank you so much!"
Five star Middle Eastern small plates!,"This was an awesome find! Fat Prince was a recommendation from a friend and I was excited to try it out, now that dining out is opening up again in Singapore. The cuisine is mezze-style Middle Eastern and the dishes are reasonably sized: fulfilling, yet small enough that you can order five or six between two. The highlights for us were a sublime cashew hummus, served with a flatbread, mushrooms and farro, and the walnut bread which came with a to-die-for date butter. We had room for banana cashew parfait as a dessert and it was another knockout dish.

Cocktails are another focus at Fat Prince; I really enjoyed The Fez, kind of a whiskey sour with rye, citrus, lemongrass and smoke. My final point is that the service was terrific - discreet yet attentive, just as it should be. Double high five to Sarah for being so great and making us so welcome!"
Eat your food in 90 min or else.....,"When we sat down to our table, 736pm...6 minutes after our allotted time due to it not being ready, we were told quite emphatically you have to be out at 9pm for the next sitting. I said, I would not have booked it if it was only 90 min. The lady in charge then proceeded to say in a very authoritarian voice, did you book via CHOPE, I said yes, then you would have agreed to the 90 min T&Cs. So you know it is 90 min sitting. They way I was spoken to was appalling. Don't ever go to this restaurant, they just want your money and then you to get moved out for the next sitting. Food was OK, not a lot to choose from. Wine list starts with the cheapest well over $100, they don't even cater for more economical wines. So basically, spend big and get out in 90 minutes. This experience Left a really really sour taste in my mouth. I would never go back and I will tell everyone of my bad experience. I don't usually write reviews, I eat out every week at difference places. This was just terrible. If you want to relax and talk, DO NOT GO HERE"
"Splendid ambience, food & service - rare gem","Lovely place at Tanjong Pagar, can enjoy as a date night or a few friends. Limited veg options but mezzes and drinks and dessert are all fabulous."
Poor value for money,"Overpriced and limited options, especially main course. We had a number of starters, a main, 2 cocktails and 3 glasses of wine for 340sgd. Poor value for money"
Great Experience,Staffs are nice and accommodating. Food is great and is value for money. Highly recommended! The ambiance is nice too with beautiful interior.
Good food & Great ambience,"Enjoyed the food and the ambience. Unfortunately, the time you can spend at the restaurant is limited to 90 minutes."
Misleading and highly overpriced,"Shocked by the bill when we ordered the lamb and celeriac.

Menu item LAMB - was about $15, the bill was $100. Apparently for lamb, the minimum is 700grams (not stated on the menu).

They mislead you by pricing it “per 100” and then charging you for everything including the weight of the bone. There’s basically a massive piece of inedible bone that you pay for.

Menu item CELERIAC - was about $14, bill was $50.
Same thing. Show one price on the menu and again brought a completely different amount without saying it was by weight and the min weight was 250g.

Beware."
"Overpriced, food was decent","Went here with a group of friends. Been to the restaurant before so I did have some expectation of the food and did enjoy dining here previously. However, they have a new menu now and selection for food is much less and their mains were highly overpriced. Staff were a bit too eager on clearing our plates at the end of the meal as well, even though the place wasn’t too busy. Might come back here, but only for drinks instead"
Do not recommend,"Food and service are average but expensive.
Ordered 3 sides, bread and 1 main for 2 pax and the total bill came to over $200 (without drink)."
Underwhelming & uncaring service,Totally underwhelmed by the weekend brunch. Average at best. But the icing was the waiter who kept spilling our water all over the table and not apologising. He even dropped some on my friend and just ignored it. Another friend asked to swap her poached eggs for scrambled eggs and they charged her $5?! The back room lacked ambiance and the waiter’s uncaring attitude made sure we will never go back again.
"Missed the Mark, disappointing...","Even at $29 for lunch, it missed the mark...
Boring, bland and uninspiring...

Having lived in the Middle East for several years, and needing a little hit of the Levant, this venue misses the mark with poorly executed purées of non descriptive food matter, lack of appropriate spices and a lamb kebab of pit roasted lamb, (maybe the pit of sadness...) it looked like a badly pulled lamb shoulder completely devoid of flavour, leaking pools of yellow grease and oil, reminiscent of the Exxon Valdez tragedy...

Ingredients wilted, sad piles of roquette leaves on the verge of rotting...

Should not have even been allowed to leave the kitchen, by the head chef, if he/she (gender neutral if you pls...) actually took the time to check the mise en place before service...

no dressing on the salad shows lack courtesy to the dying greens in their final showdown before being relegated and dumped onto my side plate...

And dessert of the day ‘chocolate tart’... or you mean chocolate tartlet... 50% full, (less than 30 grams of chocolate gloop) and loaded with chopped peanuts worthy only of a banana split...

Service... no trays delivered our beverages...
Table had to be requested to be cleared after piles of plates began to build a leaning tower of Pisa... no awareness, no one asked how the meal was during lunch, as not all items consumed... surely a tell tale fact, something maybe not right with the dish... or checking back after the luncheon.

Waste of time, waste of money... don’t bother."
Overpriced,"Food is decent but extremely small portions for the price. The drinks were also very good but again, way overpriced. A bit of hype because it's a relatively new restaurant. $$$$$"
Menu overhaul,"Mod-med Fat Prince is all for innovation with a menu overhaul. Gone are the beloved kebabs (the cover of menu states ‘kebabs’ and ‘cocktails’) making way for new non-med tasting options like Kingfish Crudo, Adana Kebab Tartare and Okra Falafel Salad (ok, this is still distinctively med and the bacon is so tasty). Due to a hangover, I could only nurse a Black Sea Sour which was oh-so-pretty with a dainty paper boat with a flower. This is a gin-based creative concoction with squid ink – unimaginable! Service is friendly, peppered with banter ala good ol’ Australian style."
Lovely ambiance; great service,"Great attention to detail- they took note of my note on the res that it was my husbands birthday and brought over some bubbles and a dessert, really appreciated. Of course the tasty food and lovely ambiance didn’t hurt either!"
Bad exprerence,"Very bad experience.

I visited the restaurant on 13 March at 2 pm with my friend, and we left at around 3.20 pm.
After the lunch, I didnt eat anything else. I started vomiting and diarrhea badly around 4 pm when I was in the shopping mall. I felt very sick, vomiting all the meals and keep diarrhea many times.

My friend also diarrhea around 4 pm , both of us suffered stomachache and I am in a worse condition.

I wrote an emai to the restaurant on Saturday afternoon, they only reply one day after, on Sunday evening. They ask me to do a blood test and seems no any further action to be taken."
Yumminess Overload,Thanks for tasty bites and spirited service. The beef cheek hash was incredible and the free flow was perfect.
Great environment Great service & Good Food,Their food is very nice with affordable prices. The staffs are nice and friendly. Would definitely go back & introduce to my friends!
FAT PRINCE BRUNCH,I would like to give applaud to the staffs at Fat Prince. Their service is one of the best an seamless that I've experienced in Singapore Food and cocktails are awesome
Warm Happy Birthday,"The staff and hosts made us feel welcome. My friend's birthday certainly felt like a real celebration. Staff are friendly without being overbearing. the food is great, too. And the cocktails are those creative fun artisanal sort you won't find elsewhere. The Hummus wins. :-)"
Great atmosphere and food,"We enjoyed very much our dinner together as party of 6. Food was delicious. Portions are not too big, perfect for sharing. Atmosphere is very cool. The music was not too loud so we could all have a conversation as a group of 6. Staff is very friendly and nice.
Totally recommend it! We'll come again!"
Amazing,"Delicious food, great menu, excellent service. Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Will definitely go back."
Anniversary Blast!,"Celebrated our Anniversary and we enjoyed every single dish from Cauliflower, Roasted Cashew Hummus, Duck Pastilla and Pit Roasted Lamb kebab are our favourites. Fat Prince Team took care of us especially Riduan, Fauzi and the rest of the team are just outstanding! We definitely had a lovely fun night! Must Try!!!!"
What an experience!,"First of all, the food is great. From the lamb to the cauliflower to the drinks. It was all a treat to our tastebuds
Second, the staff were amazing. They were really accommodating. And even one staff who didn’t really know the different tea and special coffee they have tried his best. It was all good tho.
Lastly, the ambiance is lovely. It’s the perfect place to hangout with your friends or even go on dates.
Overall, the FAT PRINCE experience was excellent. I will definitely go back and bring all my friends there."
Excellent experience,We went for our anniversary dinner and we had a great time. Food was awesome and service was great. Thnx
👌🏼,"Took my little brother out for dinner. Since he loves Turkish food. Great food, amazing atmosphere and amazing staffs!"
Amazing food and superb service!,We truly enjoyed our meal at Fat Prince. The food was great and the service was really good. The staff were very attentive and checked in regularly to make sure we had everything we needed. Can’t wait to go back and have some more of their lamb kebab and cashew hummus!
"Overpriced, nosiy and bad service","Weekend menu is 50 SGD per person which during the week is 30 SGD. 20 bucks extra for the EXACT SAME fixed menu - complete rip off! Website does not indicate the weekday and weekend prices and this is honestly misleading. Place was very noisy, cramped and chairs uncomfortable. Service was lousy - we had repeatedly waive out to waiters although the food arrived quickly. Food was ok but def not worth 50 SGD per person. For the price - the food is average and the service poor. Not going again."
Value for money,"Heard about this place from friends, went there for brunch, offers very limited menu, but set menu is good and value for money Taste is okay, collection of drinks are exhaustive ... fried cauliflower was best"
"Terrible, will never go again","We made a reservation in advance and they asked us if it were a special occasion, it was our anniversary... upon reaching the restaurant no one seem to know or give a damn or bothered to ask.. anyway the drinks and food was mediocre and the extremely overpriced.the service was pathetic to say the least and they didn’t even seem busy. the Hokkaido scallop was literally one thinly sliced scallop with grapes, Mayo and sesame seeds on it.. nothing middle eastern... Bad fusion I would say. The slow cooked lamb was some what tolerable.. Bur the worst was the service.. we asked for the dessert menu at the end which wasn’t much to begin with ... the waiter handed the menu and never came back for taking an order.. after waiting for 15-20 mins we decided to walk out.. Nothing special, overpriced, bad service... will never go back... also nothing middle eastern about it...."
brunch,Brunch menu was excellent value for money and the food was very good. Good atmosphere as well. Highly recommend.
Excellent service and value for money for lunch,"Two of us went there for lunch and had their set menu. Their set menu is good value for money. I'm a vegetarian and was pleasantly surprised with their dishes. Their falafel sandwich has some crunchy mushrooms, which gives it a nice touch. The cashew hummus is delicious and their cauliflower dish is also very good. I did not enjoy the dessert brownie much. The ambience is cosy and warm. I would definitely recommend this place to others."
Awesome Ambience with Good Food,Really enjoy the food in Fat Prince although the selection is not big each dishes are exquisite and tasty
A great restaurant with amazing staff,"Our Positive Experiences – Great location, lovely deco welcomed by a magnificent setting , good food The menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering starter and excellence service, very attentive restaurant manager and waiters. I had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavors. For this reason I highly recommend going to the this restaurant."
"Excellent food, but plastic straws","Excellent food, service and ambience!
Every dish was fantastic, except for the dessert was extremely salty and they have plástica straws... maybe they should change that,..
beautiful place as well!"
great food great atmosphere,"came here with a few friends and really enjoyed our time here!! the atmosphere and service really tied everything together! the cauliflower was surprisingly good, and acted as a good buffer for all the meats we had!"
So good 👍🏻,Delicious food and good service. The manager is so friendly. Recommend this restaurant. I will go there again.
AVERAGE FOOD,"Nice ambience, so-so food, so-so service. We took the set meal, the kebabs didn't come with any dip/sauce, hence were dry to eat with the bread. the staff weren't attentive, and made us feel as if by giving us that lunch deal were doing us a huge favour and we should be indebted to them. Didn't feel welcome."
a lunch visit,"location is nice, with a car park across the road.
service standards was fair- we had to wait for a while to get our mains.
food quality and quantity was good. we had the set lunch and no complains.
drinks were good and well priced.
The Only Issue why I won't visit again: they charge a dollar per guest for serving tap water. they call it some sustainable water charge but I think it is unfair for any restaurant to charge a dollar for tap water. As a principle I don't frequent restaurants who sell tap water."
"5th time here, always a wonderful experience","i always try to make it here anytime I can, it's a wonderful place to try different cuisines out, the hummus is always great and the cauliflower and the chicken kebabs are delicious! A must-visit for a new experience and lovely service"
Marvelous 2021,"I've a marvelous start to the new year for boozy 'brunch' at Fat Prince. I love how each of the cocktails look so exquisite and taste just as great.

Was reccomended to order 2 of the finger food dishes of roasted cauliflower and the dip, that is a must there and never to be missed!

It's quiet, rainy day, safety measures and precautions are taken, great snacks and even greater drinks. Will definitely be back to try more food next time aside from the cocktail freeflow."
Food was good but potion was extremely small,The food was pretty good ( my friends and I were all very satisfied ) but the portion is EXTREMELY small for the price paid
"Delicious food, service needs improvement","I really enjoyed the $29 set lunch - yummy food with lots of vegetarian options, generous portions and good value for money.

Waiters were a bit rushed and didn’t bother to provide proper recommendations. One closed our table!s bill without prior notice. More courtesy would be desirable"
Good food,Excellent and varied brunch menu which is good to see when most restaurant follow typical boring western breakfast...the back of the restaurant has great ambience but let down by the loud humming from the machines in the kitchen coupled by poor acoustics of the place in general.
No mixed platter,Great barmen. Great range of drinks. Would have been higher if proper Middle Eastern Mixed Grill on menu. Didnt see it.
Not bad,Porterhouse lamb and wagyu beef cheeks were amazing. Other dishes were not bad too. Pricing on the high side though.
Nice restaurant for girls night out,"Went there with 4 other girl friends for a much needed catch up. Staff were attentive and friendly. Good atmosphere, good vibes, good food, good cocktails. They allowed us to stay for longer than 90 minutes. Overall a well rounded restaurant."
Fast Service (mostly) and Good Food,"I have had the set lunch many times, and I think its great. They are able to get food out pretty quick with the simplified menu and the vibe in the restaurant is nice"
Awesome Ambience with Good Food,"I really enjoy having dinner in Fat Prince. The ambience is good, the staff are friendly and the food is great. I highly recommend Fat Prince for Social Gathering."
Definitely going back!,"My wife and I went to have dinner and drinks at Fat Prince after it was recommended by a number of our work colleagues. From the moment we walked in, we felt like it was going to be a great night - and it was. There was a real ""hip"" feel to the place. The service was prompt, friendly and efficient, the cocktails and bubbly were delicious (love that Silk Rogue) and the food was to die for. The portions may look small but the flavours are big, bold and tasty. By the end of the night, we were really full but totally satisfied. We are definitely going back. The bar area looks really cool so we will definitely bring friends and be seated there next time. Highly recommended."
Fat Prince,Excellent food and service and ambiance. I visited with my partner in Nov 2020 and we both agreed this is one of the more unique restaurants we have eaten at in Singapore. Would highly recommend.
First time at Fat Prince,Most impressed! Their toilets are clean and there is an extension for private functions. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys middle eastern cuisine.
Lamb,"Have been twice recently. One a very boozy dinner with 4 other guys and the second time with family and a friend. Seem to drink them out of their Torbreck red each time I go. As title suggests, the lamb porterhouse is a standout. The duck was very good on one visit, second time the texture just didn’t feel quite right. Kale salad and the various hummus all good. Really nice fit out and atmosphere as well as friendly service."
Un-Royal Lunch,"Ordered the Royal Lunch but it didn't feel Royal at all. While the hummus and mezze portions were adequate (cauliflower a little underdone), the kebabs were tiny. Two small falafel balls and two prawns. It was quite sad."
Bad service!,"My table reservation was 9:30pm and I was with my partner and expecting a great service once you have to leave a deposit of 50sgd ( btw still didn't get the reimbursement). The garçon probably wants to leave earlier and less than 15min we arrived, starts to ask about the food order sounds like he was in rush!"
First time but not my last!,I went last Friday with my two friends and three of us girls had the best time! The restaurant is beautiful and so are the staff’s personalities and service! The food was even better if that’s possible. The lamb porterhouse was absolutely amazing and all the recommendations given were spot on and just right for me and my friends. Thank you for the great night! See you again soon!
Awesome food and drinks for date night with friends,We had a really amazing couples date night at this amazing little spot. The menu is small but the food is delicious and packed with flavor. Walnut hummus and roasted lamb were the top picks but honestly nothing was bad! Cocktails are very tasty but also pricey so try a couple but don’t go crazy. The place books fast so book early and enjoy.
Refreshed and renewed!,"We've been long time patrons of this restaurants. They have the perfect combination of great food, fun bartenders that make staple and inventive drinks, and a vibe that enhances the entire dining experience. Some months ago, we noticed the staff changed, the vibe changed and the food all dropped in quality. Given that we'd had so many great experiences previously, we decided to give the restaurant a chance to recover, and we're really glad we did. Months later, with a new crew, the place is back! And the food - dare I say it - is even better than before. Well done Team Fat Prince!"
Absolutely delicious!,"We visited the fat prince for the first time last night, and were totally blown away! The food was awesome, there were some really interesting flavour combinations. The ambience was lovely, the staff really friendly and the cocktails great too! Thankyou very much fat prince!!"
Best Place To Impress,"Made a reservation for a birthday dinner and this place was the best to impress especially since it was me and my friend’s first taste of Middle Eastern food.

The Omega Lamb Porterhouse exceeded our expectation, the group was still raving over the meal the day after. Also, don’t skip mezze and dessert, feast completely from start to end."
Still fabulous after all these years,"Have not been back for years and still super awesome cocktails. Sadly due to covid, they did not open the back part of the restaurant. We had the scallops and hummus as starters, very comforting and later with nachos - super tasty! Will definitely go back again."
Good for all girls outing or date night,I went there for Sunday brunch and had their royal brunch set. The portion was just right for a 4 course meal and it comes with a welcome cocktail. The food didn’t impress me much except for the cake but they didn’t disappoint as well. Good ambience. I definitely wouldn’t mind going back again to try their dinner menu.
