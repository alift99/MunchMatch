Ippudo at MBS,"Very delicious food and very attentive service staff. They have extended their menu with new appetizers and we tried different ones and all were very delicious. Ramen is so delicious and its broth is so tasteful, I can‚Äôt recommend more"
Salty soup,"Went to new outlet at 112 Katong, very popular and long queues week before this. Enjoyed their quality ramen at the first opening in Orchard Road years ago when we queued 1 hour! At 11.30 am there was no queue yet. Service was very friendly and helpful. The young lady even asked if we needed explanation of the choices We settled for the very basic tonkatsu ramen, medium strands. The two pieces of chasu were nicely done but disappointingly the soup was too salty. When we informed our server he said there's a choice of salt level but this hadn't been told to us at the outset.
We paid about $17 each bowl with the additional charges, not too bad if the soup had been less salty."
Lovely Ramen,"We had heard about this restaurant and decided to check it out. We didn‚Äôt make any reservations and did a walk in. Lucky for us we found a nice table, keeping in mind the social distancing regulations. We ordered a few items - mostly Ramen, which is what this restaurant is Famous for. I ordered an eel bento which had rice instead of noodles - a bit surprising. The normal gyozas were delicious. I liked the fact that they were not too thick but were nice and thin. The soups that we ordered were also delicious. The crispy corn was excellent - a very unique dish. The ambience is nice and the staff is quite friendly and attentive - especially our server Henry was really very professional, courteous and polite. We will definitely be back here when it is safe."
Authentically Japan!,"I am back to review Ippudo after so many years, i m pleased to say that they maintained their usual standard, Glad that it is not that salty too ....the decor and setting is impeccable! Love its non-noisy environment. It never fail to ""bring me back to Japan"" to again just that their pricing may not be that cheap (also feel like trying their Ippudo bun but seemed costly)..."
Newly opened Raffles City Branch,"Despite having ramen for dinner in Tampines the previous evening, my wife insisted we pop in for lunch here when she saw the recently opened Ippudo eatery.

We had the $15.90 lunch promotion, which offers a ramen, a drink and a side. The gyoza and kaarage chicken were very fresh and tasty, while the ramen was springy and the broth was good."
Star vista outlet,Piping hot bowl of ramen- good comfort food during cold rainy days.. soup is tasty and noodles quantity is enough. I chose the noodles texture to be done ‚Äú hard‚Äù . I like it. Average of sgd20 For each bowl. Rather expensive
They also offer vegetarian options.,"Ippudo at Mandarin Gallery is an excellent place with outstanding service. From the moment you enter, the waiters are very alert and do their best to see that you are satisfied. The food is delicious and of good quality; they also offer vegetarian options."
first meal out after lockdown lifted,"this was the place where we had our first meal out after the lockdown was lifted in June 2020; was walking through Ion to Takashimaya and finally to Mandarin Gallery and all the F&B establishments were pretty much packed with queues... staff at Ippudo were professional in observing the regulations, but still were friendly and welcoming. the ramen was a welcome change to the homecooked instant ramen, or takeaway ramen we have had during this past 2-3 months of the lockdown."
Easy meal that suited the family,"we were looking for something that was accessible to a family of diverse tastes. This place worked.

It wasn't a standout for anything but it was clean and the service was efficient and the food while not outstanding was above average.

In similar circumstances I would go again."
Not bad ramen,"The ramen is ok, not too good or too bad. But you can get free upsize of ramen if you are a big water, that's why always long queue."
Ippudo bun and gyoza taste,Ippudo bun and gyoza taste super! Plus the pork noodle. Been one of my favorites place to visit when I come to Singapore. Price is worth the quality served!
"30 min wait for ramen, which had to be eaten in 10 mins","After waiting for quite some time for our food, it was challenging to get staff's attention. When we finally did, staff took long to get back to us. Only when we mentioned that we are rushing to catch a musical and that we want to cancel our order that the waitress said ""Ok, I will serve 2 bowls first and u all can share."" (There were 4 of us and that didn't make any sense) When we got served our last bowl of ramen the waiter said ""We didn't miss your order out, just that the order slip fell on the floor"" That to me was missing our order out. We had slurp down the meal so quickly that I don't remember tasting much, just burning my tongue. Anyway just an unfortunate situation during a time sensitive occasion. But perhaps, not choose Ippudo if you're on a tight schedule."
Exceptional service,"We are very impressed with Bell who took very good care of us, especially my mum, right from the beginning when we arrived at the restaurant and when we left the restaurant.

As my mum is on a wheelchair, we were ushered to seats nearby, rather than standing in line waiting for an available table. A very attentive employee. We observed that Bell was a good worker, moving swiftly across the dining area to clear tables as well as to serve hot and piping hot ramen to customers.

Bell also made the right recommendations. Chilli crab ramen was aromatic. Shiromaru ramen, served with soft noodle as per Bell‚Äôs recommendation as my mum has difficulty swallowing, was creamy and delicious.

We had a pleasant and enjoyable lunch!"
Good as expected,"Went with friends during lunch and the ramen was served pretty quickly! Service staff were very nice too and were prompt with their service.

We all ordered the akamaru and found that the spicy kick isn‚Äôt as what we expected, so we spiced it up with chili power provided at each table. Nice!"
Tasty as always!!,"One of the best ramen in singapore!! I‚Äôve been a frequent customer at ippudo mandarin gallery for a couple years. I have always gone for the pork spicy ramen and the salmon roll!! Nice atmosphere, great service and the price is reasonable."
fantastic ramen!,first time in ippudo. at the tanjong pagar branch. good food.. very tasty ramen. broth is excellent. not too thick n heavy. generous amount of sides and good value for money. will be back for sure!
Good Ramen,"Great value for money, the ramen is good too, as it is part of the chain. Friendly staff. Highly recommend coming here if you're craving ramen."
Good ramen,I don‚Äôt like to eat ramen in Singapore because I don‚Äôt like the taste of the pork broth. However. Ippudo‚Äôs ramen broth is really good üëçüèº Limited variety but good ramen. A bit to the expensive side though.
Brilliant! Excellent for Family and Friends!,"I have been a frequent customer at Ippudo for a couple of years. Every-time I go the service is great, and the food comes very quickly. I have always gone for the pork spicy ramen with original spice and hard noodles. I highly recommend this dish along with many other side dishes such as the spicy chicken wings, salmon roll, and the gyoza. The price is respectable and is appropriate for the quality and quantity of the food. Highly recommend!"
Top of the Range!,"Not being experienced in ramen broths, on recommendation we tried the pork spicy hot version. Delicious flavour and very filling. The salmon and chicken wing starters were equally tasty. Service was swift and efficient. A ‚Äòmust have‚Äô when we return to Singapore."
Disappointing Hype,"Still a good bowl of ramen, but I personally felt that the flavour did not live up to the name of Ippudo. Could have been much better. Service was also underwhelming."
Decent.,"Service was good and swift, give good recommendations. Ramen was not bad. Pretty expensive Ramen. Abit overpriced."
Decent ramen and improved services,"This place used to be mopped when it first opened. Today we went for lunch and it‚Äôs very quiet.

We were shown to our tables quickly and the waiter we had was amazingly polite and helpful. When my husband couldn‚Äôt decide the hardness for his ramen, the waiter immediately advised hard would be a good taste for his chosen dish.

When we paid, the same waiter made the point to ask my husband how his ramen was and our overall experience.

I enjoyed my bonito ramen. I didn‚Äôt finish all the noodles as it was getting rather heavy but everything else I enjoyed a lot."
Good Ramen but service require improvement,"I agreed with everyone, it is a good ramen place.

However, I think a little flexibility on service can go a long way providing the request is reasonable for example.... if customer can‚Äôt eat black fungus and request to add more bean sprouts, instead of saying yes....I have been told.....

‚Äúyou can remove it but if you want to add more bean sprouts we will charge you additional!!!‚Äù

For $18 a bowl of ramen and to ask to replace black fungus with bean sprouts I don‚Äôt think it is too much to ask isn‚Äôt it....? Surely the black fungus cost more that the bean sprouts...?

Not to mentioned when it arrives, I can‚Äôt even see the bean sprouts so can I deduct this from the bill....?!

As I said... a little bit of flexibility within reason, can only do good to business."
Best tonkatsu ramen in singapore,"Been here several times....recent visit I have always ordered their karakamen ramen as the spice helps cut the fat.... I always TOP it up with fresh crushed garlic (u need to request for fresh garlic )

This is my fav place for tonkatsu ramen.... for shoyu ramen it‚Äôs definitely Tsuta.

They got Some good side dishes as well... the die die must try is their pork bun... simple & heavenly"
Shiok ramen,The specialties are ramen (large selection) and gyoza so go straight for these. I had the aka tamago which was tasty with a rich stock. Less impressed with the pork bun and the beef steak with truffle fries that we shared. Service was excellent.
Worth the waiting time,"Always our fave Ramen and Gyoza restaurant, staff were attentive as they offered apron to me and my daughter (we were wearing white). reasonable price too!"
Ramen at Good,This is one of the best Ramen I have tried in Singapore. Taste was perfect and flavour was strong. Hado to wait in the Q for 20 minutes.. but worth the waiting time.
Fragrant tonkotsu,"Visited for the first time. Price wise I find it more costly than the other ramen shops in Singapore, cheapest ramen shiromaru motoaji being $18 (you can choose to have it without the egg though - $15).

Taste wise, not the most mind blowing but i enjoyed it. Compared to other ramen shops, the tonkotsu was not overly salty yet fragrant and creamy. I can even smell my neighbour's tonkotsu! Definitely unassuming yet memorable. I ordered extra hard noodles but I still find it at the slightly softer side, was looking forward to more chewy noodles. But that was fine for me.

Also ordered the famous pork bun but was turn off by the fatty piece of pork. People who prefer lean meat should not order this.

Will return for the shiromaru motoaji :)"
Japanese Superb Ramen,We ordered 4 sets of Karaka Tamago as it happened to be raining and wanted something warm. Though the pricing is expensive but it was a satisfying bowl of noodles. Quiet ambience as we were there earlier than lunch time. As we are leaving more and more people are queuing up.
Authentic Japanese Ramen,Highly raved Hakada ramen. Taste wise quite similar to Japan standard. The queue was crazy and I do not think it is worth the wait. Overall I think that this ramen place is overhyped. The braised pork belly bun was delicious. Highly recommend to try that.
5* Ramen,"This Hakata ramen expert has a branch in Westgate. Best time to visit is on weekdays lunchtime when the crowd is lighter & getting a table was a breeze.

They offer a lunch special: pay full price for a signature ramen & top-up $5 for a side dish and cold drink. The choice of sides ranges from sinful fried karage to tofu or dumpling to a healthier salad. For some reason, they do not serve cold green tea, kind of odd for a Japanese restaurant.

Their original ramen Shiromaru Motoaji: a smooth creamy pork broth that‚Äôs oh so deliciously decadent! The thin ramen eaten with the silky broth gives a nice mouthfeel & has a firm bite. The Cha Shu is lean but taste a tad too porky to my liking. Loved the onsen egg too. On that rainy day, it was a really satisfying bowl of oodles!

At $18 upwards for a ramen bowl, they are more pricey than the usual ramen joints. Pity I can‚Äôt do this more often but will definitely be back to try the other flavors!"
Dinner at West Gate Branch,"I ordered the spicy black ramen with an egg, it looks the most appetizing in the menu. Was craving for something warm and comforting that particular evening and chose to opt for ramen, because the other options at the mall looked too oily or unhealthy.

The ramen portions was small, it was almost child-size, and there was not much ingredients in the bowl and only 2 pieces of char-siew. The egg that came with the ramen was disappointing, it wasn't the marinated ramen egg normally served at japanese restaurants,If you wanted an egg with your ramen, its costs an extra 3 freaking dollars. So for 3 dollars, I bought myself a regular hard boiled egg.

At other ramen places you can order ramen refills, and some even have free flow of hard boiled eggs. If you are craving some ramen, you may stop by here for an expensive little snack, but if you are hoping for a fulfilling meal, i suggest going to other places for ramen."
My Favourite Ramen!,"The food and service were very good, and the tonkotsu Ramen was very good! I go there all the time with my family. It‚Äôs a must-try! Gyoza is also very good."
Lyn Lim,Had dinner at MBS outlet. Nice simple deco & staffs are friendly. Simplicity of food choices are good as you can opt to have ingredients you prefer for my bowl of Ramen. Very refreshing taste & noodles cook to our choice of texture - soft medium etc. Meat are tender & so are the basic ingredients that give flavours to your palette. Will come again & maybe try different outlets. Well done!
Shaw branch - good service and food,"The gyozas here are very good and fresh. We ordered the Akamura and kazu ramen, and the bowls were quite a generous portion. The Akamura had the thin type of ramen noodles and the broth was pretty good. The other broth was a tad oily but still tasted bland. The two tamago eggs were a little overcooked and firm.

We also had their signature pork bun, and it was tasty if a little pricey for the portion.

Service was friendly and quick."
Ramen shiok,We enjoyed the various ramen options on offer The adults opted for the more spicy ones Whilst the kids tried the original ramen
Overrated,"I went to their branch at star vista and the ramen was average and definitely overprice . The service was sub standard . Three of us came in to order and the waiter only took two order and forgot about mine . He must have thought I came here for the Aircon and Free water .
Do not be fooled by the name . If I was the chain original owner I would have taken back the franchise"
Yummy ramen,"Choice for ramen lovers at singapore. Gyoza , hiyashi sugita shoyu ramen new seasonal ramen with cozy environment."
Late night dining,"It‚Äôs great that they were opened after 11pm!

The Karaka special while soup base was very good and it contained lots of meat, had barely any noodles for a price of over $20. Was left feeling quite hungry still. Compared to the numerous ramen restaurants in Singapore, this was slightly overpriced.

Service was great and staff were very friendly."
Green Hot Tea cost half a bowl of ramen,Charged $8 for green tea for one person. Tax and service charge not included yet. I find it totally rediculous
Very delicious,Taste is very delicious. Staff have sense of service. They also have lots of queue and the price of food is very expensive.
Yummy,"Has some vouchers for Mandarin Gallery and decided to have dinner here since we have not eaten here before.

Was a good choice and we enjoyed the limited edition Sakura ramen, the Karaka-men as well as the black samurai ribs. Lovely cozy eatery that offers value for money.

We also tried the matcha tiramisu and roobois tea pudding desserts. Preferred the pudding as we mistakenly thought it was matcha ice cream. Felt it was a bit too powdery.

Overall great dinner!"
So good!,I ordered these dishes which are so good so delicious. The sushi melts in your mouth! The beef so fresh!!
Hmmm.. Could Have Been Better Years Ago,"I think Ippudo ramen used to taste better. The stock does not taste so rich now and the pork cuts taste different. Ippudo feels like a fast-food ramen shop now, as fast as noodles can be served that is. I am not sure if I like it so much as there are better ramen shops even in Singapore."
One of the best Ramen shops in Singapore,"we went to Ippudo tanjong pagar for dinner about 7PM during weekday and it was pretty quiet. The atmosphere of the shop is good. We ordered 2 x Karaka-men special and takoyaki. The food was served pretty quick. If you are new to Ippudo, the menu is sort of difficult to understand. There are four options for almost all the reman.First option is based without Chashu, without egg and i think not even seaweed and it is the cheapest option. The second option is Tamago which is with egg but no chashu. Third option is with Chashu but without egg. The last option is special. we would get all the ingredient such as egg, chahu, and seeweed. Additionally, you can choose the hardness level of the noodle and spiciness level. The broth is tasty and one of the best broth in Singapore. But disappointed with egg as it was just a plain boiled egg. Takoyaki is delicious but the price is at high side for 5 tako ball. Overall, we had a great dinner."
"If you've been to Ippudo in NYC, don't bother coming here.","After enjoying so many magical bowls of ramen in the NYC locations, our family looked forward to our meal at Ippudo in Singapore.

We went for a late lunch so it was rather quiet. The food was served quickly. Unfortunately, the staple broth and pork buns did not live up to our expectations. The broth was bland, the pork was all fat, and the ""seasoned egg"" was a plain boiled egg. The abysmal service from Derick was a rare experience. He was rude, unpleasant and defensive.

I don't know if it's just this location, but this specific restaurant is doing the Ippudo brand a disservice."
Cosy restaurant,I was looking a place for a quick lunch and stumbled upon this place. The ramen tastes excellent. The beef was great and salmon roll perfect.
Not as good as before,"Always come here with my family whenever we‚Äôre in Singapore. But, the ramen broth I had yesterday was salty. Pork buns and cranberry juice were great as usual. Would love if they serve the potato salad again as it‚Äôs now been served for the kids set menu."
My favorite Ramen in Singapore,"To paraphrase Casablance - of all the ramen joints in all of singapore, this is the one place to walk into.
The place is almost always busy, and they dont take reservations, so the waiting time can vary from 10-40 mins, but I have found the wait well worth for me.
I have been going here for the last 6 years, and though they have modified their flavors a bit over time, it still remains my favorite ramen joint. My staple is the Akamura Tamago, garlic oil based tonkatsu broth with egg, though if you are into miso, or the spicy type, they are worth while as well. fi you are really hungry, you can upgarde the bowl with :specials"" - they coem with extra bamboo shoots, eggs and a fat slice of pork belly.
The place can get very noisy though, so this is more a casual fare than a formal dinning.
Revisit : Always"
Always good but too many variations,Ippudo Ramen is always good but every time I go I see that they have more variations which is kind of pointless.
Alright,"The ramen may have been the best in singapore but IMO it tasted just alright, nothing special about it but if you don‚Äôt know what to eat, it was a place to go to"
Terrific restaurant!,"We started with fresh salmon sushi, spicy chicken wings and then the karaka - men. A delicious mix of noodles, ham, spices etc. Superb Japanese food along with good service. One of the best meals so far this year."
Ippudo Noodles to Queue For?,"Was at Ippudo Star Vista branch for dinner.
This the third branch I tried. Personally feel that their Mandarin branch serves the best even though it's all the same Ippudo.

Got counter seats to watch them prepare and cook. The miso broth comes from one same huge pot, condiments are added according to the type of noodles ordered.

I like the fact that we get to choose our texture of noodles, soft-medium-hard-extra hard. You can add on a plate of noodles for an enticing $1.

No offence but somehow today, everything's is tasting kinda mehmeh for me.

The pork bun at $4 was overpriced but not as ridiculously overpriced compared to their matcha tiramisu at $6. It was served almost straight from the refrigerator and was comparable to the size of a baby's fist.
Nothing like the square sized tiramisu pics posted at the other branches. Omg... seriously?! What a rip off!

I mean... We haven't even added the 7% GST and 10% tax to the dishes...

#overrated #matchatiramisu #ippudosingapore #mehmehfood"
Love the karaka-men,"We went to Ippudo at MBS. The Karaka-men was soo tasty. We ordered all the 4 levels of spicines (original, hot, very hot, and extra hot). There isn't too much different between original and hot. The spiciness begins at level very hot, I think. Would come here again for sure."
Warm delicious ramen,"Nothing beats a nice warm bowl of ramen during a rainy day. We also had the pork ribs (it was a large portion) and sake, really hit the spot!"
Rich Broth if you like it,"If you like your ramen with thick broth, this is the place you can try. Price is on the high side compared to other ramen,"
"Modern, great ramen bar","Modern, sleekly decorated ramen bar at the top floor of Mandarin Gallery, right beside the escalator. The all-important broth is richly flavoured, without being too strong or salty, and servers would also ask you how you‚Äôd like your noodles done. Service is, overall, very fast and polite too!"
Delicious Ramen,I always love a good bowl of ramen whenever it's raining. My favourite outlet is the one at Westgate as it is quiet and less busy during the weekdays. I really like it when they allow customers to choose the texture of the noodles. That's what they always do in Japan. Yummy noodles with excellent broth. Highly recommended to everyone.
Ms,Very tasty ramen and good ambience. The price was reasonable. Broth very good. Located at prime area orchard road and very convenient. Service a little slow.
Good Ramen,"It‚Äôs been ages since the last time I ate at Ippudo (I used to eat at Ippudo Sydney). What I remember was Ippudo is really tasty however I felt the taste in Singapore was pretty different, not as good as Sydney."
Best broth ever!!,"During my short getaway in Singapore, me and my family stayed at Mandarin Orchard and we got this recommendation from family friend to check out Ippudo Ramen which is located in Mandarin Gallery, a shopping mall just next to the hotel. It was a lunch time around 12.30 and omg the queue was pretty long already( so i was expecting something really good). We got seated after waiting in line for about 20 minutes and ordered the gyoza and ramen in black bowl and red bowl( i forgot the name). And omg.. the red bowl ramen, hands down to the tastiest broth Ive ever had!! It tasted just amazing and the sliced pork belly melted in my mouth. Definitely would recommend friends and family to try"
Food is good but service sucks,"Was here for lunch. My fourth visit and find that service standards have dropped. We were seated quickly but noone came to take our orders for a long time. We waved and called to catch the attention of waiters and it still took a while for them to notice. It is quite clear they are short handed and trying to avoid eye contact. When food was finally served, condiments such as garlic n sesame was not given. We had to wave and wait again. When it came to payment, I simply gave up and brought the bill to the counter. Quite disappointed as the waiters and servers used to be very attentive."
If you've want authentic don't bother,"I was really excited to visit the Ippudo store in Singapore as I had been to the ones in Japan. Sadly, I would have to say that it did not live up to it's expectations. For sure visit the stores in Japan - those are great.
Getting back to the Marina Bay Sands store, it's fairly quiet at times. The service is okay, they had to ask me a few times to check about whether or not I could eat the meat, etc. You should ask/inform when taking the order. Not after.
For the price, it,s not the cheapest ramen in Singapore. There are other restaurants who do a much better job. You don't get a lot for S$ 20 or even 30.

I wish the food been better. For now, I will continue to remember my previous experience over this one."
"Terribly poor quality, taste and authenticity vs Ippudo Japan","If you travel widely enough and have also eaten at Japanese Ippudo , then you might just get a shock at how far below the quality, taste and authenticity of the ramen and side dishes are at Ippudo Marina Bay Sands. They try to create a only available in Singapore ' ramen and side dishes that simply failed big time. Will never visit this outlet again. The Ippudo at Mandarin Gallery is much more decent and that is an outlet I will visit."
Incredible Japanese Food,We went to this 3 times while we were in Singapore the food is simple but very tasty highly recommended if you like Japanese food
Dinner,This is my 2nd visit to this place. The food quality and service from the lads just seemed to get better. Very attentive and pleasant experience. Will be back üòä
Different from my 2015 experience,"Perhaps I was there much earlier at about 5pm plus....
Service- only about 5 tables occupied but they still gave the table in between 2 other tables of 2. Appears that the remaining portion of the entire restaurant cannot be used. Thankfully for the sofa seat where my haversack can be placed.
The wait staff were friendly, esp a girl alesha (not sure whether the spelling is accurate) whom could inform us on the difference of choices of ramen. They also had our water refilled regularly.
Food- I am not sure why my aka chashu was a tad spicy cos I didnt ask for spicy and the menu didnt say that it was going to be spicy. weird. Furthermore, the other order, the aburi salmon don, was rather ordinary,as it wasnt smoked sufficiently. thats why the 3 stars.
Value - It was quite decent for an orchard road eatery though the price is slightly higher than a normal ramen place."
Worth while,Again cannot complain about restaurant and food. Service is good .. food is well prepared tasty and good value. One small issue the staff are so busy shouting Japanese welcomes it is somewhat noisy. Well worth a visit
Average Food,"I was at the Mohammad Sultan branch for a quick work lunch. They have a grand total of 1 veggie option - the Soba Noodle Bowl. It was steaming hot and filling with a token sprinkling of some vegetables (two pieces of pepper, arugula, and mushrooms). Considering how good Japanese food is, a couple more options to cater to veggie lovers wouldn't be a bad idea."
Execellent,Fast and friendly service eventhough it was Saturday evening and the place was packed. Had the best Ramen and Gyoza I have had in a long time. We had their homemade lemonaide which is worth a second try.
Best tasting Ramen!,We patiently waited for the long queue just to have a taste of their famous ramen.. We did not regret it. THe big bowl is soooo worth the wait! Tastes like we have travelled in Japan!
one of the best ramen,the soup is very thick ... the noodle is springy... plus tender meat... perfect....highly recommend for ramen lover
First time I found ramen can be so tasty !,"No regrets to visit this restaurant. Different types of ramen are available, and you can choose the level of spiciness and ramen hardness. If you like chewy, chose the hard ramen. I ordered the spicy black sauce ramen, so yummy! It's pricy if you order the special ramen. Tested the dumplings and green tiramisu, just average. So just focus on ramen will do."
Artistically Curated Ramen,"This place is about ramen and they are artistically composed. The broth is well balanced and rich, the noodles feel freshly made and all ingredients are of quality. The atmosphere feels young and is full of noisy efficiency. You will enjoy it."
100% happy,Best ramen I have tried ever (out of japan). Love the akamaru special. You are allowed to order extra noodles (kaedama) for a tiny fraction of the price. Their matcha tiramisu is to die for
The king of ramen in singapore,It might sounds tacky by the review description but of all ramen Singapore this is one of the best ramen you can have even it came with a crazy price tag for just a bowl (20$ and above). You can have your noodle in 4 level of hardness and some ramen with 4 level of spicy (i suggest stick with original level because it balanced with the taste of the broth). As for me the i recommend to chose the spicy ramen variety if you cannot handle the heat just have the original and it still very tasty.
Ramen Heaven 2,"You want to have each ramen languorously , sucking each long ramen and getting a slow taste of the wonderful broth. Ideal for relaxed and casual meal rather than a business one. Epicurean pilgrimage...."
Great Ramen,"Basically Ippudo is a great shop. I started frequenting their chain in Tokyo 10 years ago and will never forget it, In Singapore the experience is close to the same as in Tokyo - well done."
Best Ramen outside Japan,"I have tried several Ramen restaurants and some even in Japan but Ippudo Ramen is one of the best I've ever tasted and I recommend this especially if you're outside Japan. The Karaka men tonkotsu broth is really divine, oishi and thick - please do have a generous sip of the soup before mixing all the ingredients. You have the option to select the spice, salt, and preparation of the noodles as well as additional ingredients. Every ingredients is of best quality - fresh pork, tonkotsu broth, vegetables, spices and noodles. The price is in the mid range but your money and effort of getting here(MBS is where I went) are worth all the efforts. Free water is also served. Truly this is the best Ramen restaurant outside Japan."
Tasty,"Among the top ramen places to be had in Singapore. Tasty, fresh, with a fine balance in taste of broth and ingredients. Service was attentive and enthusiastic. Worth visiting if you're looking for some tasty ramen."
Ippudolicious!,"First time at Ippudo! Visited the location at Mandarin Gallery, which has an excellent atmosphere. We ordered Gyoza, Chicken Katsu Bun, Goma Q, and Vegetarian Noodles. All of the dishes were exceptional. Our absolute favorite was the Chicken Katsu Bun, which was prepared perfectly and very delicious. All ingredients seemed fresh and very high quality. We will absolutely return. All ramen dishes come with pork, which is the favorite of most customers but adding chicken or tofu would be great. The only negative experience was the lack of knowledge of some menu items by the waitress. Total bill was $60 for two."
Lunch,"Craving for ramen and decided to come here as our experience with Ippudo in Osaka was very good. Heard of the long queue so we went at 11:30am. Surprising no queue, but the place quickly fills up while we are there. Ordered the Shiromaru, Akamaru and the Karaka Special, topping up with the renkin chips and spicy chicken wings (highly recommended). Overall food was good, but we felt the outlet in Osaka was even better.
Craving satisfied though."
Will be back!,The char siew rice tasted so good and its so cheap $5 only. The new menu was also very tasty. Overall experience was amazing!
Good,"Service is great. Ramen is delicious, the broth not too rich & flavorful. The pork melt in the mouth. We spend ~$60 for 2 ramen + 2 teas."
Love the ramen,Really enjoyed the ramen. The restaurant looks really nice and the service is mostly friendly. Definitely worth a visit.
Great ramen but the pork could do better,"Famous for its ramen.

Have not been here for a Long time.

No queue at 12.30 p.m. on a Saturday but it was full by about 1 p.m.

Shiromaru Special

IPPUDO's original creamy tonkotsu broth served with thin and straight noodles, pork belly & pork loin, bean sprout, black fungus and spring onion. A classic Hakata-style ramen.

Selection of noodles: soft, medium, hard or very hard.

Love the ramen but am not so sure about the char siew or the 3 layered pork which I didn't find to be tender.

Goma Kyuri - crunchy Japanese cucumber with home-made sesame dressing - refreshing.

Renkon chips - crispy & tasty lotus root chips - nice & crispy.

Beef tataki- well-marbled prime beef slices, pan-seared and served with tangy soy sauce - good.

Lemon soda - a non-alcoholic cocktail made with fresh lemons and mint leaves - refreshing."
"Ramen Ippudo, Marina Bay Sands","I was feeling slightly under the weather with cold feet, nose & throat discomfort. It was 9 p.m, I was not particularly hungry but wanted a bowl of hot noodles. It was Ramen Ippudo's grand opening & I decided to try as I was en route from Bayfront MRT to MBS.

Ramen Ippudo has dine in & takeout corners. Business was brisk & the dining area was almost filled to capacity. The atmosphere was rara & lively with cooks & servers greeting customers in loud unison when customers enter & leave.

I studied the menus & decided to order from the takeout counter. The waitress promptly showed me to the counter. I was warmly greeted by their Japanese chef.

I opted chicken soup ramen, no oil, strong flavour, extra noodle, extra egg, standard onion & garlic. Chef studied my order carefully when keying into the cash register.

The commis prepared my noodle while Chef took charge of my soup & plating. While waiting for the soup to boil, we had time for a quick chat. Chef checked the finished product against my order chit again before handing over the finished product. The pace was relaxing. Chef's display of the pride in his work builds up my anticipation to eat his ramen. Best, I paid SGD12 which is almost the average cost of a meal at Rasapura Masters foodcourt.

Condiments like white & black pepper in pepper mills, chili flakes & sesame were provided. Utensils were smartly packed in transparent packaging, complete with paper napkin & toothpick.

The yellow ramen's texture is somewhat like a thinner version of 'Singapore Hokkien noodle' but had better taste, bite, elasticity & does not get soggy within a short period of time. The broth was rich yet not cloying, sweet, tasty & piping hot to the last. Dice white onion lends a refreshing crunch to the overall taste. The egg has a smooth & flawless exterior & yolk lavas out like how a good lava cake should. The portioning is smaller than most ramen other shops I have tried.

I finished all within minutes, instantly felt better & still had appetite for more food!"
Great ramen but quite a small portion,"Ippudo ramen is one of my favourite place to eat ramen in Singapore. The best part is the soup however i feel the portion is quite small for the price that i paid. I also had the gyoza and its good just like a normal Japanese gyoza nothing really special. The second time i went i ordered the special chicken and pork ramen, also good like but the best still the special pork based ramen (i forgot the name) should definitely try if you are in Singapore."
"If it's not broken, don't fix it","I used to frequent the branch in Westgate. However they have been changing their menu these recent years which is a let down as it does not taste the same anymore and has more of a fusion vibe to it (Never had experience in other ramen place where you add lemon to your ramen).

I hope they will bring back some of their old menus back."
Ippudo Marina Bay Sands,"There is more than one Ippudo in Singapore and this review is for the restaurant that is located at Marina Bay Sands, as there does not seem to be a TA pade for the Marina Bay Sands location. I'd not eaten at a Ippudo before, but after 1 meal I would certainly consider myself a fan. This is an excellent place for a family with children.
As you enter the restaurant, you get welcomed in a loud and happy way by the staff! It can be a bit overwhelming for a westerner but go with it and enjoy the attention!
The attention from the service staff was flawless and timely and we felt our every need was catered for with ease and quickness.
Our family of five had 6 dishes to share between us and spent a total of $84.74 for our lunch. We had gyozas, chahan, ribs, nanban, goma kyuri and niku soba. It was all cooked to perfection and delicious. We would have gone back again for another meal but we ran out of time."
Terrible service at Ippudo Scotts,"We were a group of 6 with two elderly grandparents. Three of us arrived half hour early to ensure that we would have a table by the time our grandparents arrived. We were at the front of the queue but had to let several groups proceed before us because our party was not complete. Once our grandparents arrived at the mall, I informed the male waiter that they were here and slowly making their way up. I also informed him that they were in their eighties and it would be very difficult for them to walk/stand for long. He ignored me and immediately proceeded to give a table for 6 people away to a group of 5 people in the queue behind us. I am terribly disappointed with the total lack of commonsense and compassion in this situation."
Too salty,Nothing to rave about. Slightly better than average but way too salty and it covered the original freshness of the broth. And yet again another restaurant that charges sky high prices for green tea and lemon soda. $8 for a glass of lemon soda ? No way. The next 2 tables left their lemon drinks half drank. Unlikely to visit again.
Best ramen ever in Singapore,Definitely one of the best ramen I ever had! You can even choose the texture of the noodles- soft to hard. The soup is delicious. Side dishes like to pork buns are amazing! Price per bowl is higher than the norm but worth the money if you are indulging in a good bowl of ramen once in a while! Service is fast and exceptional.
Is this really Ippudo?,"I have lived a bit of time in Osaka and Ippudo was my canteen there. I fell from very high when I went to Ippudo in Singapore. The restaurant itself look more of a high end than the eatery in Japan. Taste of taken is alright, but the gyoza lacks crunchiness. We received our food before the drinks and I also asked them for the pickled bean sprouts we have in Japan but the waiter told me that they don't have that.
The worst is the price. For the same food, the cost is twice more expensive compared to Japan! Just extremely disappointed
They should just not call them Ippudo..."
Have my birthday lunch here...alone!,"I came to this place on my solitary birthday on 23 Dec 2016. It was full and I have to wait for few mins only. The waitress was so friendly. She asked me to sit down and gave me the menu while waiting for my table. The ramen was good! I ordered the set menu, with additional 5 dollar only you'll get the drink and a side dish like chicken karage (i chose this one), salad and I forget the other one. It is highly recommended!"
Can't get enough!,"Love the ramen here! Service is prompt but the food is what really gets me. The pork buns just feel like they melt in your mouth. The ramen soup is just flavourful and not heavy at all! Will be back again soon, for sure!"
Good ramen though a bit pricey,"Having had the ramen a few times in one of the branches in Tokyo during a recent visit, I thought I would try it in Singapore. As expected, it is much pricier here with where it is located. But the quality of food seems comparable."
Good ramen and don't forget to try their sushi,Love their ramen but don't forget to must try their sushi. Very nice and fine dining like quality. You will want more and wanna come back again.
