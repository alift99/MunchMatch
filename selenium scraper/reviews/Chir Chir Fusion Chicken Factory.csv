Juicy garlic soy wings and berry soda! (Recommended!),"Tried the garlic soy wings and paired it with some fries and berry soda and it was really good! The wings were coated with the right amount of sauce and the berry soda was sweet enough without being overbearing :)) the fries were also pretty generous, will definitely drop by again!"
Tasty fried chicken,"There is no place for self control at a place like this.
Sour cream and onion was my main and it was every bit as tasty as the picture looked. Skin was crispy, sauce was generous and I want another one.
For dessert I had the honey butter chicken. Do not doubt the warning that it is sweet and addictive. I'm probably gonna order this every time I come here.
Also had a garlicky chicken, which was 10/10, exactly what it says on the tin. You can't go wrong with garlic.
They even have pretty drinks. We shared a blue toktok, non alcoholic because my friend is weak, but it was refreshing and sweet so no regrets."
My go to Korean fried chicken place in town (and in Jurong too!),We ordered 2 kinds of chicken. The Khan Pung King came with tteokbokki and sweet potatoes. It was flavourful without being too jelak at the end. The soy garlic chicken is a safe option and was decent for its price.
Wonderfully fried chicken with incredible variety,"Ordered Kkan Pung King and Garlicky Soy Chicken, and despite being on the pricier side, the fried chicken certainly has a sizeable portion and tastes incredible. The meat is deliciously tender and juicy, while the skin is crispy enough to be easily separated from the meat.
Kkan Pung King comes with plenty of sweet-and-spicy sauce, which may not be spicy enough for the Singaporean palate, but still pairs well with the chicken tenders and rice cakes.
The Garlicky Soy Chicken is a simple and tasty option for those who wants less sauce, and more of the chicken, in their meal. The photo shows the portion size of ""Whole""."
Amazing variety of Korean food,"Upon arriving at the restaurant, I was amazed by the variety of food they serve. There were so many unique fried chicken flavours and there were also other mains for people who isn't a fan of chicken. Chir Chir is definitely a reliable brand if you're looking to satisfy your Korean food cravings. Great and efficient service as call, highly recommended!"
Superb korean fried chicken :),"One of my favourite Korean fried chicken places in sg! Went for less conventional flavours this time round (curry and sour cream & onion) and they did not disappoint! The cheese topokki is also a must-order, leave some cheese sauce to dip your chicken in"
delicious fried chicken with shakes!,"had a very good dinner experience at chir chir! the spicy fried chicken was mouth watering, had just the right amount of spice. very comforting and satisfying. tobokki was also delicious, and the pineapple shake helped to balance out all the spice with a refreshing sweetness. 10/10!"
Wonderful Experience!,"Looking for a step up from your regular fast food store? Chir Chir delivers with well seasoned, delectable Korean fried chickens! Was pleasantly surprised by this Cheesy Fondue Chicken, which was a good mix of sweet and savory. Highly recommend! üòã"
Cheesy Fondue Chicken - a must have,"We tried the Cheesy Fondue Chicken, and the Soy Jjimdak - both were hearty and yummy! Truly the best of both worlds , the cheesy fondue chicken was savoury while the soy jjimdak was sweet! I loved the cheesy fondue chicken, a must get for me!

Service was impeccable as well - overall a very positive experience :)"
Flavorful Korean Chicken,"We ordered the Garlicky Soy Chicken which was very flavorful and had generous portions. The Chir Chir Mi Chir was surprisingly not as ""jelak"" as I thought it would be and thus, enjoyable! However, i'm someone who likes stronger flavors and felt like the cheese could use a bit more salt. Overall, it was a satisfying meal!"
Delicious Korean Chicken,"Ordered Fried Chicken and Rosemary Chicken. The portion is huge! I Preferred Fried Chicken because it is juicy and crispy. For Rosemary Chicken, it is on the saltier side but I would recommend trying it due to the unique taste. The side dishes like baked potato, sweet potato and tteokbokki are delicious too and go well with the chicken."
nice korean chicken!,"we ordered rosemary grilled chicken and crispy fried chicken. the portions were really good! fried chicken was crispy but not too oily, and rosemary chicken had a unique savory taste. we added rice cake and sweet potato for the fried chicken, the sweetness complemented the chicken nicely. recommended!"
Korean Chicken,"The garlicky chicken was really good! Ordered the fries and rice cake as well, very generous with the fries!! Great place to chill with friends :)"
Korean Food,"Food was magnificent! Really love the half garlicky chicken! It came along with the sauce with it which was fantastic.

The kkan ping king was good as well as it has that kick to it, recommended for those who loves spicy meat!
Would recommend going on a weekday as there is less
crowd"
Would visit again!,"Ordered Garlicky Chicken and Khan Pung King and love both dishes! Garlicky Chicken was super crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The garlic sauce was yummy and not too sweet as well.

The sauce on Khan Pung King has a very nice kick but only for those who can handle spice! Love the sweet potato and rice cakes in the dish as well."
10/10 fried chicken experience with Chir Chir,"Enjoyed the generous portions and juicy tender fried chickens! Was actually craving for Korean fried chicken and was really satisfied with Chir Chir!

Ordered the Sour Cream & Onion Chicken, Crispy Fried Chicken (Half) and Topokki & Cheese and my personal favourite will be the Sour Cream & Onion Chicken. Was pleasantly surprised by how the chicken went really well with the sauce.

Was a 10/10 dining experience, will definitely recommend this place to fried chicken lovers!"
Crispy chicken fix :),"Visited chir chir chicken at Bugis the other day! The food was good, we ordered the rose cheese chiqueen - crispy chicken tenders in a creamy mix of mozzarella and fondue cheese. The portion was big, and probably meant for 2-3 to share. We also ordered the half portion of spicy yangnyeom. It was a generous plate of delicious hot crispy chicken in a sweet spicy sauce, very tasty :) will definitely be back to try their other dishes!"
Chir Chir Food Review,"Was an enjoyable dinner at Chir Chir with a wide variety of choices to choose from! Starting from different flavours of fried chicken to soups, sides and unique dishes such as Topokki & Cheese (Which we ordered it)! For fried chicken, we ordered the sour cream tenders as well as the half spicy fried chicken which was both extremely delicious! The portion was also huge for 2 pax sharing therefore suggest to go in larger groups of friends or families to try a mixture of different fried chicken! Definitely a good place for group gatherings ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Korean Fried Chicken Frenzy!,"Extremely tasty korean fried chicken and there were so many different flavours - was literally spoilt for choice!! Also the servings were extremely huge and half a chicken felt almost as big as a whole chicken! The cheese tteokbokki was meant to be a casual selection but was surprised by how good it turned out! Cheesy and not overly surfeiting, a good sharing dish! Also very family and friend-friendly place and its better to visit this place with a larger group to try a larger variety!! Flavours of the spicy chicken was really good with a strong sweet and spicy kick, and the sour cream and onion was good although was a tad bit sweet. But given that they were chicken tenders - super convenient to eat and not even tough! It was so juicy and tender and was crunchy from the batter even when doused in sauce! Super delish! All in all 10/10!! Deffo worth trying!"
Chir Chir Fries,The fries went well with the chicken as it provided some carbs for the meal. The sauce was good and not too spicy as well.
Spicy chicken + beer = 10/10,"If you‚Äôre a spice lover, definitely go for the spicy jjimdak! I swear, it was so unassuming when it arrived, my friend even asked me if I ordered wrongly and I didn‚Äôt get the spicy one. But wow - spicy food and cold beer really goes super well. And the portions are big enough to share, can get a few flavors to try! (Garlicky soy is pretty good!!)"
Spoilt for choice by flavours,"Craving for some Korean fried chicken and decided to give Chir Chir a try.

Was spoilt for choice by their selection of fried chicken flavours. We finally decided on the classic garlicky soy, and K curry which I haven‚Äôt tried before. Chicken was tender and really crispy. The portion was also really generous too!

We had the bulgogi fries as well. Fries were well fried with added yummy chicken bits. Great for starters!"
How can it be so moist?,"Super moist, super tasty fried chicken. Could be abit more spicy though. A very authentic Korean fried chicken experience, best with some beer. I saw some other ordered some stew, it look very good, shall order it my next trip."
Korean Fried Chicken dinner,"Had a pretty decent dinner. Ordered spicy yangyeom chicken and chir chir mi chir. No regrets, both dishes were tasty and definitely filling. More than enough for 2pax. Worth a try"
korean fried chixxx,"Half Yangyeom Chicken was p juicy n cronchy (almond flakes were a nice touch!), Chir Chir Mi Chir was creamy, served piping hot, w a variety of ingredients, tho got a lil jelak towards the end so maybe more depth in flavour would have helped.
Overall a good meal w p decent service !!

do make a booking tho, went on a weekday night and it was quite full!"
unique chicken flavours!,the portions were really generous! my favourite was the honey butter chicken. would definitely recommend to children or if you cant take spice like me. will come back next time!
Crispy and Yummy Korean Chicken!!,"Honey butter chicken was so savoury and sweet, definitely a must try! I love the spicy fried chicken too, just the right amount of spice level! The mac and cheese was so delicious, and cheesy!!"
"Juicy, Tender and Crispy","ChirChir definitely exceeded my expectations! I ordered the Garlicky Soy Chicken (Whole) and Chir Cheese Fries Tower. The ingredients were all extremely fresh! The chicken and fries were both fried to perfection; juicy, tender yet so crispy on the outside! Portions were really generous! Staff was really helpful and friendly! Highly recommended!"
Chir Chir @ Bugis Junction,"Ordered the Half Garlicky Chicken, Chir Chir Mi Chir, Topokki & Cheese and Mac & Cheese.
Started off with the Mac & Cheese, it was creamy but bland, it lacked taste.

Next was the Topokki & Cheese, such an interesting concept, like the Mac & Cheese but using Topokki instead of Macorroni, and it works! Creamy & Tasty; the Topokki was soft & chewy, also loved the extra bacon bits & ham on top of it.

Tried the Half Garlicky Chicken, a huge recommendations is to add $2 for the Topokki & Sweet Potato, perfectly glazed, it was absolutely delicious and combines well with the sauce from the chicken.
The chicken itself was tender & delectable! Loved the Garlicky Flavour.

Lastly, we had the Chir Chir Mi Chir, the chicken was meaty and tender, the sauce that came with it, rich & creamy, and the spaghetti was a nice added touch to the dish.
It was like a creamy carbonara in a form of a chicken.

Overall, asides from the slight damper from the bland Mac & Cheese, the rest of the meal was an overall success."
"Great tasting chicken, juicy and tender.","Great tasting chicken. Portions were good too. Tried both the spicy fried chicken and the jjimdak which was soupy with fried chicken in it. Spicy fried chicken was great and not too spicy. Jjimdak tasted much better than it looks, and the chicken retained a great taste and texture even in the soup."
Savory and filling chicken,"I popped by with my friend for dinner since we wanted chicken, and we definitely got what we came for. Huge portions, juicy chicken and strong savory flavors made us stuff our stomachs to the brim. Loved the cheesy tteokbokki as well, that disappeared quickly."
Fantastic Korean Chicken,Ordered way too much. Would order again. Chicken was juicy and flavourful and the drink was lovely. My fave was the sour cream and onion chicken dish.
Fried chicken goodness,"Generous portions, great indulgence üòäüëçüèª. Mac and cheese was yummy surprisingly. Would come around again for the fried chicken."
Nice fried chicken!,Loved how the chicken is fresh and not too oily~ The flavours are good too! Ordered the normal fried chicken and garlicky chicken.
Delicious Korean Fried Chicken,Have not had such impressive Korean fried chicken in a very long time. We ordered the garlicky fried chicken which stayed crispy despite being smothered in delicious a garlic sauce. We also had a rice cake stew and a mac and cheese which went perfectly to satiate us. Definitely will recommend!
Great food and hangout spot,"Great food and ambiance to hang out with friends! I ordered the Spicy Chicken (wings) and it had super crispy skin on the outside, but moist and tender meat on the inside. Spice level isn't too high and very palatable for someone who doesn't take spice well:) Good pairing with beer too!"
Crispy and casual food! ‚úåüèª,"Along with the food, the interior and branding of chir chir is great for casual gatherings with friends and family! ü•≥ had the bulgogi fries, Mac and cheese, and k-urry chicken tenders üëçüèª Had a good meal and a good time!"
get your fried chicky fix hereeeee,cosy and conveniently located in the mall connected to somerset mrt!! very tasty chicken. if you don‚Äôt want your hands to get dirty you can get the tenders. it was succulent and super tasty!
First time try,"Not one for fast food but mention Korean fried chicken, I‚Äôm up for it any time. Funny thing is I‚Äôve never tried Chir Chir before and I must admit, how come I never tried before !
Since only 2 of us, we ordered the garlicky soy chicken, the spicy topokki and Mac & Cheese.
The chicken was savoury and lovely, the garlic was not overpowering. The spicy topokki is my favourite and the deep fried squid with the sauce was fantastic. Mac & Cheese was nice too but eat it with spicy sauce to bring it to another level!
All in all, a very happy first time and definitely won‚Äôt be my last time !"
Good food and convenient location,"Really, really good fried chicken to satisfy your fried food craving!! Added teokbokki to the fried chicken as well, and the chewy texture was 10/10. The creamy chicken with pasta was really good too!"
Eating every chicken,"Look, it‚Äôs fried chicken. It‚Äôs crispy, juicy and satisfies any and all cravings for some deep fried goodness. It smelled so good we couldn‚Äôt wait and took a bite before we remembered to even take a picture. The sauces are great too but if you want good fried chicken, you won‚Äôt go wrong here. Come and eat here if you‚Äôre in the mood to - as the hound from game of thrones says, ‚Äúeat every f***ing chicken in this room‚Äù."
Yummy Eats!,"Food was served relatively quickly. Tasty and generous portions of the chicken. Garlic soy chicken is very flavourful and packs a punch, and chicken is tender and crispy. Mac and cheese is very yummy too!"
Flavourful chicken and yogurt drink,"We had Kkan Pang King, Cajun Chicken Salad and Grapefruit Yogurt with soju. The yogurt drink is super dangerous- blended so well with soju I forgot it had alcohol. Very thoughtful of staff to put soju on the side so we can decide the portion! The chicken was filling for 2, sauce added a new flavor to spice things up. Cajun chicken was a nice texture added to the crunchy salad. Would reccomend and try other outlets. Must try their yogurt drink!!"
Korean Fried Chicken,"Tried the Honey Butter Chicken, fries and topokki & cheese, they were amazing. Might need to wait awhile for the chicken but it comes fresh and hot. Would have been better if we went as 3 pax for the food we ordered as we couldn‚Äôt finish. 10/10 would recommend and definitely will be back to try the different flavours."
Great food,"The food they serve is great, quality is good as well given the price point. Really enjoyed the cheese tteokbokki we ordered. Will come back again when i am around the area!"
Great place for fried chicken and drinks!,"Ordered the rose chicken and grapefruit yoghurt cocktail jug. Rose chicken was a nice portion for 2 pax. The chicken was very well marinated and tender. I really enjoyed the mix of vegetables to balance out the meal as well. The yogurt and soju drink was really refreshing, definitely a good pairing for fried chicken."
Delicious fried chicken,We were spoilt for choices between the different chicken flavours available on the menu. We ended up going for their signature Rose Cheese Chicken and ordered Grapefruit Yoghurt to pair with it. The chicken definitely did not disappoint with its flavourful and tender meat. The Grapefruit Yogurt drink was refreshing and complemented the chicken. The staff was helpful and offered help in cooking the dish and pouring our drinks. Would definitely return for more!
Delicious Korean fried chicken,"The food was great, and I especially enjoyed the honey butter chicken. The dish contained teokbokki as well, which was a pleasant surprise. The chicken overall was tender and juicy, and complemented by great flavours. I also had the blueberry sofa, which was light and refreshing and not too sweet."
Satisfied my Korean Chicken cravings! üòã,"The restaurant was very conveniently located in the mall. Was greeted by the cute chicken mascot at the entrance and friendly staff. I had a tough time choosing between the unique dishes on the menu. We eventually ordered the Rose Cheese Chiqueen, Mac and Cheese, coupled with a jug of PassionFruit Yellow TokTok Mocktail! The food was so delicious and I had a lot of fun eating while vibing to K-pop songs. Would 10/10 recommend it to those looking for a good Korean Chicken place! ‚≠êÔ∏è"
Great Chicken,"The staff was very friendly and kindly reminded us that the metal pans were hot so as to avoid any burns. The food was very filling and tasty as well, with us trying the signature Rose Cheese Chiqueen that definitely did not disappoint. The Passion Yellow Tok Tok, a passion fruit mocktail (alcoholic option available too!) paired with soda water complemented the savoury chicken well. Would be open to coing back here again!"
"Casual Dining, Great Food","Casual ambience, great food. Tried the rose cheese chiqueen and honey butter chicken.

The first one was a very balanced meal - between the crispiness of the chicken and flavour of the sauce, between the colours of the vegetables and the brownness of the chicken, cheese and wedges. Flavour wise, I would say it's a bit more of your typical fried chicken with cheese but it's definitely pleasing to the eye.

The dish that won my tastebuds tonight was the honey butter chicken. The sweetness of the honey butter powder was delightful, and went surprisingly well with the cranberries and almond. The fried tteokbokki was sweet as well, although I wish there was a bit more. The sauce was slightly sour (it might have had vinegar) but absolutely went well with the chicken.

Do try out the honey butter chicken if you're there!"
Good Korean Fried Chicken,We ordered the rose cheese chiqueen and toppoki. The portion is really huge for 2 people so perhaps its better to share this with bigger group. The cheese melts nicely and compliments with the chicken quite well. It does not overpower the taste and retain that savory and creamy texture while eating. The toppoki is a nice addition to change the palette but is a bit too spicy for my liking.
Really good chicken!,"We ordered the spicy wings and topokki, both were really tasty and went well with the pineapple shake!"
Satisfy Your KFC* (Korean Fried Chicken*) Cravings,"The outlet is perfect for a weekday dinner if you want to avoid a large crowd!

We had the Rose Cheese Chiqueen - which was savoury and rich from the creamy mix of mozzarella and fondue cheese. The potato wedges and chicken tenders were delightfully crispy, pairing nicely with the fresh cherry tomatoes and broccoli. There was a nice bite of spicy from the rose sauce that personally elevated the dish for me.
The Topokki & Cheese was also a fun twist on a family favourite meal. You won't regret anything cheesy on the menu!

And lastly, no meal is complete without a drink - the mango lychee smoothie was both sweet and refreshing. It was big enough for sharing between 2 pax .

Overall, a lovely experience, 10/10 would recommend!"
My default Korean Fried Chicken spot!,"Had the soy garlicky chicken (half) and it was AMAZING! It came piping hot and every piece of chicken was well-coated. The chicken remained crispy throughout the entire meal and was never soggy. Loved the sweet and savoury mix of the soy garlic marinade, and will definitely be back for more. Highly recommended place to host group gatherings :)"
Good Food,"I‚Äôve been here multiple times, and the Mac and cheese never fails to impress, simple yet rich! My friend and I tried their curry-powder chicken and mango lychee smoothie, both of which didn‚Äôt fail to impress! The chicken was crispy, with a sweet curry powder and not that spicy, and the refreshing mango-lychee smoothie helped even out the meal!"
"Good Chicken, Great for Groups","Laid back ambience and a menu offering a wide range of Korean chicken options, Chir Chir is a good place to gather in groups over dinner and drinks. Had a cheesy good time with their spicy cheesy dakgalbi. If you love cheese, or really just anything chicken, this might be a place you should visit. Service there was prompt and polite so ‚Äò‚Äòtwas a good dinner!"
Hearty & Filling,"We had the Curry Chicken, Mac & Cheese, and the Mango Lychee Smoothie for 2. Generous portions, amazing service, and of course the food was excellent. Highly recommend all of the above, looking forward to my next visit!"
Fried chicken is a must-try!,"Had the garlic soy chicken and the spicy dakbap. Chicken was fried perfectly, the sauce was savoury and yet didn‚Äôt make the chicken soggy. Loved the spicy dakbap, though be sure to bring more people to share the large serving. Also slightly towards the spicier side, so opt for the soy dakbap if you can‚Äôt really take the heat. Overall excellent experience!"
Cheesy goodness,"Nice, quiet ambience. Ordered the Toppoki and Cheese and it was really satisfying. Chewy rice cakes and an addicting cheesy sauce, topped with slices of ham. Would definitely go back for this dish! Also ordered the Rose Cheese Chiqueen, which was hot and cheesy with decent chicken tenders."
A good korean chicken fix,"This place has long queues, but it was worth the wait!

We ordered the spicy chilli soy and garlicky chicken - both were really good, w really huge portions! The sauce is generous and the chicken crunchy.

We also ordered the rose cheese chiqueen - a wonderful hot plate of chicken, potatoes and melted cheese.

Would recommend for a quick korean chicken fix!"
"5/5 Korean chicken, must try!!","A really pleasant experience, will definitely patronise again!

Ordered the Garlicky and Spicy Chicken, the spices were really on point for both flavours and the chicken was very tender and also served piping hot.

The Bulgogi Fries Tower was a good accompanying appetiser and the meat bits complemented well with the fries.

While savouring the crispy, tender and flavourful chicken, the Grapefruit Yoghurt drink acted not only as a thirst quencher but also as a really refreshing beverage to complete the entire meal.

Overall a 5/5!!"
FRIYAY at Chir Chir,"I love that all their dishes were served hot and fresh! We ordered half Garlicky and half Spicy Chicken (and personally prefers Spicy!) and the chicken was still crispy after eating till the last piece, despite being drizzled with sauce!

The bulgogi from the Bulgogi Fries Tower was a generous portion and went well with the fries and olives - really brings back memories from Korea!

Rly glad we had our FRIYAY dinner at Chir Chir and excited to visit again!"
Good korean fried chicken,"Tgif!

We ordered the spicy chilli soy and garlicky chicken - both were really generous portions, with generous sauce and very crispy chicken.

We also ordered the rose cheese chiqueen - a wonderful hot plate of chicken, potatoes and melted cheese.

Would recommend for a quick korean chicken fix!"
YUMMY KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN,"Had the kurry chicken, bulgogi cheese fries and chilli soy chicken! My personal fav was the Kurry chicken. It was saucy and delicious, and even had tteokbokki bits in it. The cheese fries were also delicious and super yummy! Portion wise, it was super duper filling, I had to eat much lesser for dinner after. I like having big space when I'm eating too so the spacious sofa seats in the bugis branch is suitable for me! Will want to go back to try the drinks out the next time!"
my fav korean fried chicken,"This is one of my favourite chicken places in singapore because of the good deals and the tasty chicken. For a change wanted to try the kurry chicken, cheese fries and chilli soy chicken. But the lunch deals (spicy or garlicky) are awesome options if you‚Äôre here for a quick combo lunch. Will be coming here again soon for sure!"
korean fried chicken!,"had a great time with my friend over at chir chir on tuesday! wasn't too crowded and the food was yummy. the cheese dakgalbi wasn't too spicy and its perfect for those who prefer boneless chicken. garlicky chicken was not too bad too, but would be better if it could be more tender. overall would definitely recommend anyone craving for korean fried chicken !"
Good Food,"Ordered the Cheese Dakgalbi and Garlicky Chicken. It was quite a lot for 2 but the Garlicky Chicken was really good we really enjoyed it! The Cheese Dakgalbi was also nice, the tteokbokki was very soft and there‚Äôs fillings too. However it‚Äôs can get very cloyed but it‚Äôs still very enjoyable!"
Spicy Jjimdak is great!,Had the Spicy Jjimdak and Rose Cheese Chiqueen recently at Chir Chir and am so surprised at the Spicy Jjimdak because the flavours and the sauce were so good!! The Rose Cheese Chiqueen were rather basic and really cheesy which I was okay with. It can get quite jelak cause the portion is rather huge (quite worth it).
Chicken galore,Ordered the Spicy Jjimdak and Rose Cheese Chiqueen. Really large servings and chicken was nicely flavoured! Really love the generous amounts of cheese that came with the Chiqueen. Really nice service from the staff as well!
One of my go to fried chicken,"Been to Chir Chir multiple times, the fried chicken is scrumptious and the tapokki is good too. The fried chicken is recommended to be dined in then take away, as the fried chicken would not taste as good when you consumed it after awhile."
A little disappointing from what I remembered of Chir Chir,"Had both regular fried chicken and curry fried chicken delivered via Oddle for home consumption; overall OK but there is a strange taste to the chicken which I can't describe... Doesn't seem very fresh. A bit disappointing because I remember being wowed by the Chir Chir fried chicken I had in Bugis a couple of years ago. The squid and leek pancake was OK too but the squid on it was rock hard - again suggesting it may not be very fresh. The spicy rice cake was not bad (though a bit too spicy for my personal liking). Had expected the cheese egg roll to be sweeter like the Japanese egg rolls I am familiar with but it is not at all sweet; tastes just like regular omelette with cheese (- maybe Korean egg rolls are meant to be like that?). Had made a note requesting for 1 can of coke to be changed to Sprite. I even saw my note clearly printed on the receipt stapled to my food bag but my request was totally ignored. No reason given, nothing."
My Favourite Korean Spicy BBQ Chicken!!,"Chir Chir Chicken
Food - Spicy BBQ Whole Chicken - The chicken does not have alot of fats, the spicy bbq sauce blend into the meat and skin. Every part of the meat is tender even breast meat. Serve with salsa sauce, an egg, potatoe and Toppoki. Mango Salad - Depend on season, the mango can be sour but I love the vinegar dressing for the salad. It's open up my appetite and to have some salad with all the meat. (feel less guilty) Pineapple Smoothie - I Love Pineapple, the drinks is smoothing, in the meant time you had your fruit of the day!! (Like that also can) These 3 are my favourite MUST to order and their Mac & Cheese and Cheese fries if you have more people!! OMG!!

Service - All orders of Chicken have to wait for ar least 25mins to bake/fried it fresh what so Yummy?? Try out for yourself, those cannot take spicy it might be Hot for you but it is Shiok!! Fried Garlicky Chicken for those who dont take spicy."
30 mins of each of our lives wasted,"Our family of four visited this restaurant on 7 Mar at 6.15pm. Our order was taken at 6.30pm. At 6.45pm when we noticed that tables that arrived later than us were served their food, we decided to check with the server. Despite pressing the bell for service none came, finally a man in black approached our table after 5 mins. We asked him to check on our order. He left and came back and asked us brusquely, ""who took your order"", and left. The guy who took our order then came over with another menu. He said, ""sorry I keyed in your order to the wrong table. Can I take your order again."" We asked him, ""how long will we have to wait again, since we already waited for 30 mins."" He replied surly, "" I don't know. It's very crowded now."" Well it wasn't even that crowded when we first arrived and placed our orders to begin with. He did not even try to reassure us that he will get the kitchen to expedite on our order nor offered us drinks while we wait. Nothing. At that point we decided to just walk out. Very disappointed in the service."
Yummy chicken with hearty portions,"I‚Äôve tried Chir Chir before because of their Burpple deal previously, and I enjoyed it so much that I dropped by Chir Chir again using the 1-1 deal.

Food portions are huge! Definitely best to go with at least 4 pax to enjoy a wide variety of food. Dinner times are usually crowded, had to queue pretty long to get a seat, but it was worth the queue!"
Great chicken,"Love this place, always try to get there when in Singapore. Service is always average, which is weird because it is definitely not cheap! Love the chicken nest! They need to sort out the service and drop their prices but otherwise its great."
Bad service,"I stood outside for nearly 10 mins, multiple times the crew walked past me without even saying a word. Even the man in a black shirt (the manager?) looked at me and just walked away. Not even a ‚Äúhold on a moment‚Äù or even any semblance of a smile. Gives off a really unfriendly feeling and makes me feel like leaving instead of waiting and wasting my time. I don‚Äôt mind waiting if they‚Äôre busy, but they could at least have the courtesy of letting the customer know they are busy. Also, just a suggestion but a couple of chairs outside would be helpful, especially for takeaway orders. Saw someone standing outside for a long while waiting for her order. Food is been pretty good overall, just the service needs improvement. I‚Äôve worked in the service industry as well myself and it just doesn‚Äôt give a pleasant feeling if the service crew is always frowning all the time, it makes the customer feel unwelcome."
Poor service attitude,"I do not see it as a coincidence that both branches that I have visited for my meals with my family and friends have such bad attitudes even though the food is fantastic. From the moment I stepped in and ordered my food, the service by the people here have been so unfriendly. They even discouraged me to order the food I wanted just because of the long waiting time. When I asked for a larger table when the whole restaurant was empty, the staff refused to give it to me. Furthermore, the face they gave was super black and often walked away so quickly when I wanted to order my food or called for them. Please take note of the service in Chir Chir."
Food tastes sooooo good; Service can be improved,"we ordered the Clucking set menu for lunch and nothing disappointed us. Crispy chicken was tasty and juicy; Fries was good and salad is well mixed. Their grape fruit ice blended was nice too.

However, to achieve a 5-star, I would recommend to train the service staff in 2 areas

1) To be able to recommend house / guest favourite; Staff replied, ""it depends on your taste."" after being asked that we are the first time guest and would like some recommendation.

2) Not make a guest wait at the queue line while 2 staff are sitting at the table chatting and then when the guest went in to pick a random table, only after 5 minutes than a server came up to ask ""table for how many pax?"""
Amazing chicken,"Tried Chir Chir chicken for the first time yesterday and it was amazing! I loved the original fried chicken which was served with a wasabi mustard(?) sauce! My next favourite would definitely be the garlic fried chicken and mac & cheese! It was a very simple but good mac&cheese my friends and I truly loved it, the portion of the chicken and mac&cheese were just nice for us too! :)"
Korean chicken,"This place serves a good servings of korean chicken. As a person who don't eat much spicy, this place serve quite good soy korean chicken, its neatly fried and i must say the quantity is huge. With the price, i believe its worth it. I really recommend this place for a gathering."
Chir Chir at JEM - Terrible,"Patronized Chir Chir at JEM, and the restaurant was pretty empty at about noon time. They gave us the menu and we ordered the food from the menu given. Then, after ordering, we saw a signboard which was rather hidden at the entrance. Then, we asked immediately that we would like to change our order. and I asked the service staff why wasn't the set menu given to us when we first sat in. The reply was, you have to ask for it. CRAZY MADNESS seriously... how would I know there's set lunch menu when it's not given? The service staff can reply me, you could have referred to the signboard. Seriously, I dine in and I've to refer to the signboard. terrible service."
Crispy chicken wings,If you‚Äôre looking to get your fix of crispy chicken wings in Singapore you can get it here. The wings are freshly fried to order and come with a choice of sauce if you want. They wings and fries are seasoned with a lemon peppery spice that is quite interesting.
good fried chicken,it serves very good fried chicken but I do agree that they r overpriced. Prices of Korean fried chicken in Seoul is even cheaper than spore.
Korean Fried Chicken,Service was pretty good and the atmosphere was a lively one. The portion for the mac n cheese was a little short and a little too cheesy. The sweet and spicy chicken was pretty good though! Can't say that it is totally worth the price paid however.
Overpriced Fried Chicken,Deep fried chicken with cheese rice balls. I went to try with my family - quite disappointed. Should've gone to KFC or Popeye's. Spent 4-5 times as much. Never going back and wouldn't recommend.
only chicken dishes,"i feel that they should expand their menu instead of just having chicken dishes, they don't even have rice as a side, and water had to be purchased.
portions were for a group of at least 3 people, some dishes were good, others mediocre.
will only come if i crave chicken but not as a typical meal."
Delicioussss,Had a early dinner here with my friends. Ordered a spicy rice cake with seafood which we really like it. So spicy yet tasty. Then ofcourse we ordered the fried chicken as well. Both dishes were fantastic.
Chinatown Point Outlet,"Dined here on New Years Eve at then Chinatown point outlet as there was no queue. The roasted garlic cHicken is tender and flavourful. We also liked that they provide plastic gloves but u need to ask for them.
Agree with the other reviewers that it would be good if they have single portions because as a couple, we struggled a bit to finish that one mains and we did not order sides. Would have like to be able to just come back and eat alone and try other flavours but you definitely need 2 at least."
Nothing Special,"Had decided to try out the Chir-Chir, it's nothing special. Their ""Korean"" fried chicken doesn't taste much better than those you get at KFC. It's overhyped and overpriced, you're better off getting cheaper options elsewhere."
Chicken,Possible the best Korean fried chicken in Singapore! Always get the original one to share - or not. Interesting selection of drinks too.
Interesting to say the least,"""Fusion"" is a fun way to look at this. It's delicious chunks of chicken smothered in various sauces, cheeses, seasonings, etc. It was fantastic, although it seemed more appropriate for dining for two. I felt like a real fatty eating there by myself."
Korean fried chicken delight!,"If you are a fan of Korean Fried Chicken, do not miss this! Tried half original crispy chicken and half ""garlicky"" favor, very tender and not too oily! Goes well with the mango salad! The interesting thing is the restaurant provides a nice little metal pick that allows you to pick up and tear the hot chicken pieces apart without getting your fingers oily."
Amazing Fried chicken,"Visited this joint with my SO during a weekday afternoon. The place wasn't crowded then but I've heard that queues can get pretty crazy.

We ordered the cheesy rice cake and the soya sauce fried chicken. This place does not serve tap water so you'll have to buy your own. The chicken was amazing but the cheesy rice cake was pretty mediocre.

The portion size was rather huge. Service wise as it was not busy the staff were very attentive."
Garlic Roasted Chicken,"I am a local and was with a friend at 313 Somerset when we decided to try out Chir Chir since there wasn't a queue. (The restaurant used to have really long queue at all other times I visited the mall.)

Firstly, I am very bad at eating anything spicy and boy was I glad that they have a wide range of non-spicy flavors available. I was contemplating between the mac 'n' cheese, all the 'cheesy' chicken options, and also roasted garlic chicken. Chose the garlic one at the end as the picture on the menu looked too good to resist. Was a tiny bit upset that I couldn't try more since each portion is meant for two. So go with a big group of people if you can!

We waited 20mins for the food to come, and honestly, it was well worth it! It actually looked even better than the picture. Taste wise, it's probably the best korean/garlic chicken I've eated. At my age, barely any food surprises me anymore. The garlic chicken far exceeded my expectations and I find myself constantly thinking about it all the time.

I heard that the beer with the whipped cream is awesome as well and I can't wait to be back for the garlic chicken as well as to try all the other dishes I was eyeing."
Spicy BBQ chicken never fail me!! It's disappoint me when it is SOLD OUT!!,"I visited the outlet of Orchard 313, Bedok and Chinatown. I had tired their fried chicken and BBQ chicken. I still prefer the Spicy BBQ as the sauce is very tasty and even the breast meat is tender. The mango salad go well with the chicken as too many fried stuff or meat will get bored too. Another recommendation is the Mac & Cheese, there's few different type of cheese and it is serving in a hot pan. The staff was attentive too, I do not have to wait and order my food but pls note that the BBQ chicken take 20 mins to be cooked. In the meant time, we could enjoy our salad and Mac & cheese first."
Higher end Korean Chicken Wings WORTH IT,"Good choices of chicken wings recipes and beer with whipped cream. It was new for me and quite enjoyable. The service was efficient and the place was clean. I recommend this place if you want good chicken wings with heavy seasoning such as cheese, whipped cream and more.

2 Dishes for three guys was perfect."
Nice Garlic Chicken,Visited the outlet at Bugis. When for the garlic cum original fried chicken combi and the passion soda drink. The drink is enough to fill 4 glasses. The chicken is a tad too much for 2 adults. Preferred the garlic chicken which was delicious. There's quite a lot of seats available at this outlet.
"First attempt, will not try again","Tried my first attempt during dinner. Walked 2 tables occupied, but within 30mins. Almost 98% occupied.

Looking through the menus, was quite reluctant to order as there were not much choices. So me and my female colleague asked the service crew to recommend and helped us order. Bad choice made. She ordered a whole spring chicken for us 2 ladies. We did not finished the chicken as it wasnt fantastic at all. KFC or 4 fingers beat them down anytime. I have to admit it is based on personal perference. But their drinks and chicken is really nothing fantastic."
Delicious and fresh chicken,Was quite a wait for the meal. The chicken set TOP up for 2 Flavours (original and spicy) was certainly worth it! Chicken with mustard sauce can be surprisingly delicious too. The grapefruit yoghurt jug is suitable for 2 pax only.
