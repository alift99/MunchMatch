Good Greek Food,"Greek food is very different in taste from French and Italian food, but it is delicious, simulating, filling and hearty nonetheless. And dining here feels like being transported to a sunny town in Greece.

Looking at the menu, I decide to order Tzatziki at first look because I like its ingredients of Greek yoghurt–best yoghurt, cucumber, garlic and olive oil. The service team lead is very thoughtful to suggest two dip platter instead, so that I can try another kind of dip and I, as a solo diner, will not be overwhelmed by huge amount of one of kind of dip. I opt for Taramosalata, which is white cod roe with lemon juice and breadcrumbs.

Tzatziki is so creamy and refreshing in taste. The tangy flavour of the yoghurt complements the cool element of cucumber so well. The garlic adds a hint of distinctive aroma to further spice things up. Spread it on the delicious pita bread with pillowy interior, this is pure comfort food, with lots of zest.

Taramosalata is more intense in taste. Not bad, but I prefer Tzatziki, which totally whets the appetite.

Super fluffy bread with crusty exterior is a joy to much on. This is the first time I try bread sprinkled with rock salt and oregano, and I love it.

I get a shock when Htapodi, aka the Octopus, is presented onto my table. My first thought is, ""Is it possible for me to finish this?"" And to add on to it, I'm not even a fan of octopus.

But this dish manages to convert me into a fan, and I know now why this is a speciality of the restaurant. The octopus is unbelievable tender. In fact, this is the most tender octopus I ever have, baby octopus aside. Slightly chewy but still easy to bite, packed with light briny flavour accentuated by splashes of lemon juice, and laced with a thin layer of smoky taste and charred meat, this is oh-so-good. By the way, I easily finish every bit of this.

Galaktoboureko, which is flaky thin Filo Pastry stuffed with semolina custard and Greek honey syrup, looks simple and is simply yummy. Semolina is a kind of durum wheat used to make this custard that is slightly different from the usual custard. This custard has more structure and is more curd-like in texture, I like it. And it pairs excellently with the slightly stretching thin pastry.

The place is beautiful: full of little details, like the bird-like lamps, the bougainvilleas, the straw-hat lamps, ratan chairs, , white-washed walls, full-panel glasses to let lots of natural light in to add to the dining experience. It reminds me of the famous Greek island, Santorini that I see in the photos.

The service is very good, being polite, professional, friendly and prompt to response. The team lead guy takes very good care of me by informing me to order dessert later and offering to hold my order of chicken skewers due to the possibility of me not being able to finish everything. And true enough, due to the generous portions of food, I have to limit what I can order. I'm really impressed by this thoughtfulness.

There are other food items that I really want to try here, not to mention a dining experience here really perks up my interest in Greek cuisine, so I look forward to be back again.

Thoughts: Greek food is awesome!"
Fantastic!,"Absolutely phenomenal! We loved the food and the wine and service was very warm and personal, much better than what you get while dining out on average. It was our first visit and we will definitely be back!"
terrible cashier,"The foods were good, and the service staff was excellent.
However, the cashier staff was terrible.
She looked very angry about something and ignored me for more than 10 seconds.
She made a loud sound to do a cashier job in front of me. I was so disappointed and got unhappy feelings."
Good Food partially let down by service quality,"Food quality is excellent though service was cold and slightly aloof, a big drop off from that experienced at the Tiong Bahru experience unfortunately."
Best Greek restaurant in Singapore!!!,"By far my most favorite restaurant in SG! A modern sophisticated venue with an exciting ambiance offering authentically the best Greek cuisine in SG which is all jazzed up. Highly recommend and please note this is coming from an authentic Greek Must try the prawns, calamari, dips, horiatiki salad, gyro and the yummy desserts Wine menu is also impressive with some of my most favorite white wines from Santorrini... Assyrtiko!Greek inspired cocktails are also a must. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do every time I visit from Australia!"
Family Dinner at Bakalaki,"Arranged family dinner at Bakalaki. Food, wine and the staff services are excellent and also reasonable prices. But the seats taken at hall was a bit noisy."
Great food. Even better Service.,"Came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary.

One of the best (if not the best) service we had in a restaurent in Singapore. We were attended to by MK and he was simply fantastic.

Food was great too.We ordered the bread and dips, moussaka, meat platter, the Greek doughnuts. The highlight was the moussaka, which tasted heavenly yet didn't feel overly rich. The Greek doughnuts were fluffy and light. Will definitely return for sure :)"
Excellent food and service,This is our go to restaurant every time we are in Singapore. Just wish we have more time in Singapore to try all the dishes on the menu. Food is authentic and excellent. Service and atmosphere was top notch. Looking forward to our next visit.
Great food but service only OK,The food is still amazing and comes relatively quickly. Wine is very well priced. Just the service is a little off with not enough staff and staff dont seem to know whats going on
Awesome!,Very satisfied with their food! Nice place for couples or groups. Staffs are friendly & helpful; 1 of the staff moved my husband & I to a bigger table that seats 4 although we didn’t ask for it.
Go to place for Greek Food,"Great food - the greek salad is must try, Amazing service - very attentive and pleasant Cheerful ambiance which will transport you to Greece."
Best Greek restaurant in Singapore,"Celebrated father’s and mother-in-law’s birthday here. The service is fantastic, lamb chops and cod fish roe with pita bread is a must order.

You can save some money by buying and using chope vouchers. Check with the staff before buying the vouchers just to be sure.

I bought the vouchers and used them on the spot.

Also, once in a while they give free desserts if you dine in"
A Taste of Greece,"Homely, authentic, genuine flavours. When a restaurant focuses on the quality of food, all else falls into place. For me, the best Greek in Singapore!"
Excellent Greek food,"They have recently moved from Tiong Bahru to a new location at Martin Road which is still nearby. Always enjoyed the Htapodi (grilled octopus), Paidakia (grilled lamp chops), they never fail to impress!"
Excellent Food and Service,One of the best Greek food restaurants i have been to for a long time. Service provided by Miss Dimitri was superb.
Family Dinner,Love the new ambience and as always food excellent! Still have room for improvement for service. Nevertheless we will be back!
"Unnecessary stress, unprofessional and poor service.","Unnecessary stress, unprofessional and poor service.

My husband and I love the food here so when I was assigned to organize our team dinner for 15pax, I immediately called them to make a reservation. I called one week in advance as I know reserving for a big group is challenging and booking for large group is often received via call only. They confirmed my reservation right then and there.

Two days ago prior to the team dinner, I called them to ask if I can add one more pax. To my surprise, they said that there’s no such reservation and that they can’t accommodate it on our agreed date. I even asked if there are other options, but they bluntly just said ‘no we cannot’ without offering any amicable settlement then hang up.

That was very rude. And I didn’t even hear a single sorry. They weren’t apologetic at all.

I hope they’ll have better reservation system in place soon."
Advantages of the Restaurant,The ambience was clean and great. Employees are friendly and helpful. The food is delectable and fresh. The price is reasonable.
Daughter’s recommendation,"Made reservation at their new location. The ambience was great, it was very crowded. Great place to try , nice selection of wines."
Delicious Greek,The owner Antonis was very friendly The food is out of this world and the service was amazing Best Greek I’ve ever had The galaktobourek was phenomenal
Thriving dining experience,"Bakalaki provide such an exceptional dining experience during my visit. Their services are superior. Moreover, Bakalaki able to cater the needs and exceed our expectations."
"Mediocre food, bad service","No one greets you when you enter the restaurant. You have to seek for attention to get seated. You want to order food, a waitress who served us free bread says she cannot take it. Someone else has to do it apparently? Ordered house wine. Takes ages to be served (dunno why?). Octopus was overly dry. Lamb was ok but nth amazing about it- rather it was salty for my liking. I prefer fresh lamb racks simply roasted. Good ones taste juicy on its own without much seasoning. Don’t understand why ppl rave about this place. It’s just average. Using Chope vouchers, it’s cheap. Maybe that’s why ppl like this place.."
Perfect Greek restaurant in Singapore,I think with title I said everything.. Very nice food and service. Everything is good there. Strongly recommend to go there. Price is on the higher end but it deserves ( something like 100 SGD per person)
Awesome food and great service!,I love the cozy vibe and ambiance of their new location. Food was great and good amount of portions. Kudos as well to the great service and food recommendations from Maricel! Would definitely come back to try the other dishes!
Disappointed,"We travelled 15 mins each way to go to this restaurant being Greek-Australians and we had scouted out this restaurant wanting to support fellow Greeks. The service was rude & blunt. We tried engaging with the owner by speaking in Greek, and honestly it was like speaking to a person in another language. We have had the most magnificent experiences here in Singapore with Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Korean and Singaporean restaurants and we have felt so welcome and at home with these other restaurants, but funnily enough in our own cultured restaurant we felt like foreigners. Not only that, but the food was cold, not authentic and extremely overpriced. We go to Greece every year and have never experienced this low level of service and high prices to buy a gyro. It cost us $115 AUD to have 2 gyros, saganaki, a Coke Zero and a small Greek salad? We wouldn’t of minded if it was good, but it was honestly mediocre. If you’re a Greek or non-Greek wanting to find the friendly Greek hospitality and culture that the Greeks are known for, you won’t find it here. The only thing this restaurant had going for them is that they played nice Greek music."
A great journey in Greece!,"Very good greek cuisine. Fresh, full of mediterranean flavor . Warm welcome from the team and many gluten-free option.
The new place is bright. Beautiful bar area. Still a bit noisy unfortunately and no more terrasse but better neighbourhood.
Greek salad, whole fish, tatsiki and kebab style sandwiches are great.
Less convinced by the desserts (bit heavy)"
Needs improvement on food quality and food stock,"Disappointed that many items were out of stock, and we even ate early at 5pm. There was no hummus (what?! you're a greek restaurant!) There were no dolmades (a staple of any greek table) and there were no loukoumades (the Greek honey doughnuts). The calamari starter was chewy and not fresh. The meatball starter was dry and poorly reheated, not fresh. However, the beef skewers were fantastic! Decor is beautiful and staff is attentive and helpful. Pity about the out of stock items and poor quality."
"Awesome Services , Amusing staffs","Came for dinner with Family as they visited their old place at Seng Poh Road. All staffs were friendly especially Mr Han who gave us his undivided attention , alternatively recommended the potion for my family.

Our orders came fast and food tasted just right for my famly. Beside the free flow warm and cold water , generous sauces displaced on the table quickly replenish, just before we do payment, the Boss of the restaurant blessed us desserts flow with Honey and was soft to our last taste.

Will return for the unique taste again !"
Awesome experience,"Love the food especially the lamb and the ambience ,the staffs were friendly and attentive, this was birthday celebration for my daughter and their gave us dessert and candle for celebration, awesome !"
Lovely afternoon celebration,"It was my first time, have been wanting to go for a long time after a lot of recommendations. It was a lovely experience.
I went for a special occasion and I noted this in my booking. They gave us a very nice dessert not from the menu which was such a lovely touch to end the afternoon!
Highly recommend their octopus, spicy feta dip and the doughball dessert!
I will most definitely be coming back for more visits!"
Best meal in singapore,"I went to singapore for 5days and went to a lot of places. But Bakalaki was the best meal I had in singapore. Definitely recommand the octupus dish, and the lamb."
Authentic Greek Food & Atmosphere,"A great authentic and above all warm and hospitable Greek Dining experience. Charming host, accommodating and quick service of exceptional greek cuisine. No Dips and Pita Plater but other selections, make up for it. Strongly recommend and will be back."
Celebrating a birthday over dinner,"This is the award-winning Greek restaurant that is situated along Tiong Bahru Road and has won numerous awards for its fine culinary skillsets and the quality of the food.

The decor and ambiance really felt like I was really in Greece by the seaside and furthermore, the staff was super friendly and nice.

The food ordered was delicious as we ordered the platter, some Greek favorites, and topped up with a bottle of red wine.

When dinner was over, the staff cleared the table before bringing out the birthday cake and started singing the birthday song. They were also nice to give us a round of their special Greek wine in a shot glass.

Overall, it was an excellent experience!"
Dinner for 3,"Totally enjoyed the food and the ambience. Service is good. Love the pita bread, octopus and lamb chop! Can't remember how many visits already. Will be back again for sure."
It is worth the experience..,"It is one of these very few restaurants in Singapore where you do not even check the bill when it’s coming. No matter what the price is, it is worth the experience… We are french, we know Greece well and this is a really great address.."
Good Food and Excellent Service,"Yummy food especially the grilled octopus and lamb. Service provided by Indran is excellent, attentive and not imposing. Heard that they are shifting to a new location soon, at Martin Road, hope it will be as charming as the current Tiong Bahru location. Will visit again!"
Great greek food experience,I was a very pleasant food experience. The venue it's clean and spacious. The service is great and the food is pretty greek.
Excellent Find,A colleague recommended the restaurant. As a person who lived in Melbourne it is easy to know good Greek food. Bakalaki hit the spot with an excellent menu choice for sharing and experiencing the many options of Greek food. Good service and highly recommended.
Excellent,"Food was delicious as always, service is on point - enthusiastic, timely and joyful …showcases the amazing Greek spirit Never a disappointment and always exceeds expectations and my good memories"
Grilled Octopus is a must order,"Food is decent (though I think in general Fotia's better), service was warm but the overall ambience is loud and noisy (bad echo) given they were running full house. Plus aircon was dripping water on my arm half the time.

Love the pita bread with the dips - Eggplant, White Cod Roe and Hummus (not smooth enough though). Grilled Octopus was on point, in fact a generous portion for that price compared to many other places. The pan fried feta cheese drizzled with honey was interesting, but can be an overkill if you have less than 6 people sharing it. Sea Bream was fresh, but the mixed grill was disappointing.

The Greek white wine that the server recommended was good but forgot to note the name and take a photo."
Humiliating experience at Bakalaki,"Had the most atrocious n humiliating experience at Bakalaki last night. The manager of the restaurant made a racist comment about Indians loudly, targeted at us and we heard it! He said crazy Indians further supported by a gesture of fingers rolling at the side of the head! Worst is that he said this remark to the owner of the restaurant seated at the table next to us! They all laughed at our expense! Being Indian, I felt enraged and summoned the manager who had made that remark when we had requested him to cut our chicken roll into 2 as I wanted to share it my sister who had accompanied me.
On confronting the manager, he first denied saying anything and then apologised casually as though it was no big deal!
We asked for the owner of the restaurant to come who shrugged off the comment by saying what’s done is done!! The cheek of the man!! We felt so humiliated and decided to leave the restaurant immediately and there was no genuine apology from any of them except for standing around and defending their behaviour!
Never Again!! Horrible experience for a night we wanted to enjoy!"
Great food & service (special mention to Peter),"We had such a great time! We ordered dips with pita bread, grilled chicken, lamb chops, Greek salad, grilled prawns, fried calamari. All were delicious, and the Star was the lamb chops that were cooked perfectly - tender, juicy, delicious & no gamey taste! Even the grilled potatoes that came with the lamb were flavourful! Service here is also really good, especial mention to Peter who attended to us- he’s friendly , warm, and made sure everything turned out well, thanks!"
🐙 Super Rare Find Greece Food Grilled Octopus Htapodi! 🐙,🇬🇷 Our out of this world Greece Food dream was made possible by Antonis & Bakalaki's wonderful heroes filled with love & passion 🇬🇷
Wonderful lunch,Wonderful lunch break with family. We had greek salad. Was a generous portion. Moussaka was great. Lampchop was soft and juicy. Seabass was really fresh. Try it!
Great time!,Food was great but didn’t expect to see so much fries and we ended up over ordering. It was for a birthday celebration and it’s great that they gave us a cake on the house!
Amazing food & such a beautiful restaurant,"The best Greek food in Singapore, with amazing vibe that transports your right away to beautiful Greece. I wanted to try everything on the menu as everything looks so good. Back in 2 weeks for more yummy food!"
"Great portions, service and quality","We went to Bakalaki with our son visiting from uni to celebrate his arrival. Despite the reputation for Singapore restaurants being high quality we found that exceptional quality here to be surprising. Everything from the salads, freshly made hummus to the meat platter was well portioned and seasoned to perfection. The wait staff was attentive and charming. Say YES to the Limoncello!!!!"
Nice food and nice environment,their service very good. i have ordered lamb chop and octopus leg. the lamb chop very tender and nice. the meat seem like beef...nice!! definitely will come back again to try their fish
Bakalaki delivered,Bakalaki lived up to its reputation. The taramasalata was so very good. Every thing we we ordered was good except for the chicken with pasta. that was the only dish short on flavour.
Yummy food & cozy place,We enjoyed our CNY reunion dinner at Bakalaki very much. Food is great and place is beautiful & clean.
Standard still good!,we enjoyed the grilled octopus tremendously! The meat platter for two was actually good for 4 people provided you also order 2 other dishes.
Good food and welcoming vibes,"Singapore has a number of really good Greek restaurants which means Greek food agrees with the Singaporean palette. Bakalaki occupies a very spacious venue at Seng Poh Road, right beside a fairly busy road, but the noise level of the traffic was not a bother when you are sitting inside, but it could be if you are dining outdoors. The service is warm and welcoming and prompt - a well run crew. We ordered the three dips and the Pita bread. I liked two of the three dips - the egg plant one does not quite agree with me. Next the Massouka and the Spanakopita - very well executed. The Feta Saganaki was a good combo of cheese and honey. The mains - the Octopus and Lamb - were good although I liked the Lamb better. The Octopus was a little tough I found. Decent selection of wine but the one I wanted was not available alas! Overall, I think it was a good experience so it is a good choice to satisfy your Greek food cravings."
"Great Food, Great Service",Food was authentic and delicious! Service from Peter was exceptional as he was warm and attentive to our needs!
Splendid,Very cosy environment Staff is very friendly and attentive to our needs Place is very well decorated and windy Food portions are pretty generous and taste great
Dinner,Good food and service. Ambience is fun but peaceful at the same time. Staff were very friendly and ensured that experience was pleasant.
Restaurant with a vibrant ambiance,"Come here with friends to have a good evening out. The ambiance is vibrant. Our food experience was average, starters better than mains. Wine was good."
Excellent service and food,Enjoyable in every aspect highly recommended. Only issue is parking which can be expensive. Staff are freely including the bosses !
Excellent dining experience on 28th Dec 2021,"1. Excellent ambience & food was amazing.
2. Customer service was impeccable. Special mention to CY or See Wah who was extremely attentive, polite & professional. Explained about the options to have reduced portions for certain dishes that really helped avoid food wastage.
3. Definitely worth patronizing again and will recommend to friends."
Best Greek food in SG!,"Cosy ambience, delicious food and great service. All praise for the traditional greek salad (Horiatiki) & grilled octopus (Htapodi)."
Delicious Birthday Lunch,"Bakalaki never disappoints. Of all the restaurants in Singapore, my daughter chose to eat here to celebrate her 18th birthday (and her 16th). Delicious food, open atmosphere, and attentive service. A perfect outing."
"Delicious food, excellent service","Second visit. Quality of food was wonderful. A great warm environment to sit and eat at. Great service, did not have to wait too long for the food. During both of our visits, we were given 1 desert on the house. And the deserts were absolutely brilliant. Would love to go back for a third."
An excellent Greek restaurant,"Bakalaki has a charming decor and is an excellent restaurant, with authentic Greek food and friendly service."
"Excellent food, great hospitality","We love Greek cuisine and Bakalaki is one of our all time favourite. The food is hearty and delicious, the staff and management are very generous. We love their hospitality.
All dishes were great but tonight the winner was the Feta Saganaki. Wow! Looking forward to the next dinner."
Great dinner,"Had a really nice dinner at Bakalaki: service, food and ambience were on point. They were very kind to us, highly recommend coming here!"
Friday night out,Amazing restaurant with implacable service!! Every time we go we are impressed with everything! Definitely worth the time!
A greek restaurant worth visiting in Singapore,"I have been visiting regularly bakalaki and I am very happy with the ambiance, the service and the food quality.
Their food is very close to the food we have in Greece. The personnel is very friendly. Prices are similar to other greek restaurants in Singapore. They use very nice ingredients in their food. Wish they had some special offers for greek alcohol."
Back to Athen for lunch,Authentic Greek food coupled with great ambience and service. It felt like we were in Athen for lunch. Love it.
Amazing and consistent,We order the same stuff as it’s so good and always consistently good so why experiment Great ambience great service Keep it up
Fantastic Greek Food,"I had booked a table for dinner and we were punctual (as always). We were escorted to a nice indoor table with a lovely view of the restaurant. The menu is nice and quite easy to follow. Drinks menu is nice as well. The decor is quite artistic and truly Greek. We really felt like we were transported to Greece. Service staff was attentive to our table and after seeking some recommendations on wine, we ordered a lovely medium body red wine. We ordered a starter and some mains, just enough for 2 pax. We couldn’t really finish the moussaka as by then we were quite full. Portion sizes are good. We really loved the grilled octopus, which was charred, smokey and flavorful. Wish there was some lime sauce / tartare to go along with the grilled octopus. Thanks to George, we were treated so some delicious baklava cake and port wine which was a perfect way to end a lovely dinner evening. We will surely be back here to try some other dishes. I hear the lamb chops are delicious, which we will eat on on next visit with some lovely Greek wine. Price wise it was quite affordable as well. I recommend getting the Chope voucher if you plan to spend big. Bon appetite !"
Lovely place and food but...,"We didn't know what to expect as it was our first visit.

Queue management needs improvement. A lot of people were there as everyone had a 5pm rsvn. The head and tail of the line was unclear to us. The lady with frindge who was manning the entrance looked clueless and just stood there daydreaming didn't manage the crowd. Some diners who came later were ahead of us.

We were served by an Indian staff and all was good until a young lady served our food. As the table was small, it makes sense for the staff or us to arrange the dishes to make space before you put the new dish down. This lady, intended to put our grilled squid down with the handle poking into our dips until I asked her to stop.

All in all, food was great albeit a bit pricey. It will be better to reinforce trainings to your younger staff (part timers?)."
"Great food, amazing service","Food was great, service was exceptional. We were served by Peter, and his customer service was superb. He was very attentive and hospitable. Whenever the food was served to us, he would introduce the food to us individually and speak a little on it. Also, throughout our dining experience, he will pop by to check in with us (ie, if we enjoyed the food etc).

Great service overall that makes you want to return!"
Excellent!!!,Great Greek food and service and atmosphere! What else can one ask for? Been there before and definitely recommend it to my friends as well.
Excellent as Always,"This is my favourite restaurant in Singapore for food, service & ambiance. A fabulous menu for everyone’s tastes and great for vegetarians, as well. Thank you for another memorable lunch, superb"
Great food and environment,Enjoyed our dinner. The team is very attentive and the food always great. Strongly recommended for anyone looking for a lovely evening
The 'overseas' in Sg,"Best place for Greek food. Excellent service, fresh seafood, nice ambience, good spread of food. I'm a repeat diner here. Order the Greek salad, octopus even you're there"
Always my favorite place,"Awesome Greek foods, friendly staff, good service, good wine... what more I can ask for! Taramosalata and Moussaka are my family's favorite and just to die for...so good!"
Good,"The food is good overall, the price is just nice with fifty percent discount. The restaurant is at ground level of a hotel, took a while to locate the place"
Nice ambience but sneaky upselling,Nice ambiance and the food was good but the upselling is a little sneaky; was asked by the staff when ordering starters if a dip was wanted with it. Said yes only to find out on the bill that the dip cost $17++. Hence a bit dishonest I feel.
Absolute must visit! Amazing,"Absolute must visit! Amazing staff, music and food. I would recommend the typical Greek salad and tzaziki with pita"
Salty,Usually one of the best restaurants in Singapore. Had delivery tonight and I have to say I was disappointed. Dolamites and chicken Yiros where so salty it was not enjoyable. Guys try to keep up the quality we associate you with even with deliveries.
Will go back. Fantastic service,"First time visit.
Modern restaurant serving delicious, authentic food.
Couldn't get a reservation inside (place was packed, even on a Tue) so sat outside.
Service was really good, to the extent I was very pleasantly surprised.
One issue: lighting was low so it was difficult to read the menu as it was in small letters so I had to embarrassingly use my phone light to read it.

Food was great and the souvlaki kebab beef/lamb mix was mouth-wateringly good.

We will go back..."
Delightful evening in Greece (when unable to travel there),"Great service, very professional yet friendly. The restaurant has a very large spacious feel with lots of variations on how to dine from high chairs, to normal tables to lounges. Has the feel of a modern taverna. We were 4 people and started with 4 starters, calamari (delicious), eggplant dip with pita bread, feta cheese in honey and sesame (amazing) and halloumi in lemon. All delicious. We then shared a mixed grill platter for 2 between 4 and oven baked vegetables. That was great and plenty for the 4 of us. We had coffee and baklava, icecream and they threw in a complimentary plate of honey puffs which was a lovely surprise. Lovely evening. Mid to high in price but definitely worth it. Also be prepared to book ahead as books out quickly."
Amazing service and gyros,I went here with my family. It was the first time we were here and the service was amazing. They were very attentive. I ordered a souvlaki which is a wrap with some meet and vegetables. It was deicious and I have even had it in Greece.
Great service,Very good food with great service. Bakalaki has a pleasant atmosphere and the service staff was attentive
First experience with Greek food and definitely not the last!,"It was our first time here for me and my girlfriend and we had the most amazing time. Food was amazing from start to finish. We had Pita with Tzatziki, the calamari, the Moussaka and Souvlaki. Topped that off with the Loukoumades for dessert and even got a complimentary Giaourti!

Absolutely amazing food coupled with an ambience that made us feel like we were in Greece, it was a perfect date night. :)

Special thanks to Bartender Kenny for attending to us. His warmth made us feel very welcome and his recommendations were spot on. We also had a pleasant conversation with him towards the end of our dinner. His service is commendable and I am impressed.

100/10 will definitely be back again!"
Wonderful Greek Food,Awesome lunch. Food is great quality. Service is fabulous. I will keep going back for more. Nice spacious ambience.
Awesome Dinner,"From the moment we walked in we were warmly welcomed. Lots of greek wines on the list, so I asked what would suit me based on my tastes, and the recommendation was spot on! The food was fantastic. Service impeccable and the atmosphere. Was brilliant.

While you have to book well in advance, and having heard great things about Bakalaki, it was well worth the wait! Can't wait to go back again."
One of my favs. Service could be better though,"Great energy when you walk into the restaurant. I have been a few times and it has never disappointed in general. The fava is fantastic, the sea bass was well-prepared and they even de-bone it for you, the desserts like their rice pudding are marvelous. The drinks are a little short on variety, while there are a number of Greek options like wine etc which is great, if you feel like just having a nice single malt or an interesting cocktail - the options are extremely limited. We had to re-order some things a few times because a male server wearing a pink shirt missed it out, he also seemed to have an attitude for no reason and was rather rude. The rest of the staff were super friendly though giving it a homely vibe.

Overall would definitely be back."
The best Moussaka and Service in Singapore!,"A bustling tavern on the side of Tiong Baru with cheerful lighting and a large donkey at the entrance!

We went there famished and ordered the Moussaka, fried sardines, grilled chicken, vine leaves and Greek salad from a waiter called Calvin. He was cheerful and added “perhaps you might wanna get a half portion instead of a usual portion so that you could try more stuff?” This was great advice!

When the bread was served, it was crusty on the outside and moist yet warm on the inside smelling of olive oil. Lovely.

The house white was a good pairing and as we were enjoying the evening, Calvin appeared with dessert and limoncello and even an extra shot digestive which added sparkle to the evening.

If you’re looking for a great experience, friendly vibe to cheer your soul during COVID, come try the food here."
Great food and great service,"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, everything was delicious. We had the Horiatiki salad, dolmades, chicken yiro, lamb chops, octopus, melitzanosalata agioritiki (eggplant spread). Food arrived fast. Our server, Calvin, was very cheerful, attentive, patient, and gave good recommendations. I'm so happy to see that despite covid the restaurant is still going strong, maintaining their quality, and attracting diners."
Yummy Mediterranean cuisine,The location is lovely and you feel like being in Greece. The food is very good and the portions are generous.
Best Greek food in town!,"Always a pleasure coming back to Bakalaki. We’ve been buying takeout, and the online ordering is very smooth. Delivery is an option, personally I prefer to pickup.
Christos and George are always most hospitable, and the food and wine impeccable! Best service, & best Greek food in town!"
Great place and great service,Celebrated my friend’s birthday at this restaurant. It has nice ambience and delicious food. Ingredients used were fresh! Great service from Calvin - gives great recommendations on the food selections and make sure we don’t over-order. He always refills the water and ice without us asking. Very polite and attentive! Overall a 10/10 experience:)
Exceptional service by Calvin,"Came here for a birthday celebration with my group of friends and was served by a young gentlemen by the name of Calvin. He provided exemplary and exceptional service, with great attention to details. Food here was great and not to mention the relaxing ambience as well. Will definitely come back for sumptuous greek food again!!"
It was almost like in Santorini,It was a great dining experience. Service was fabulous and not only the waitress that served my table (forgotten to ask for her name) and the owner too. They serve complimentary dessert because it was a birthday celebration and the fantastic dessert wine. Food was yummy and even bought some bottled honey from them and it was great. Will visit again！ So noisy and so happy.
Dinner at Bakalaki,I would highly recommend this place for dinner! We sat outdoors and it was lovely. There were fans. The food was good and the service was great with smiling faces all the time. I would recommend this place over Blu Kuzina just because of the service itself!
Please sit inside,We had a lovely birthday dinner sitting outside at the veranda and the food was excellent . Unfortunately we got at the end interrupted by three gigantic cockroaches. One came onto the table and two were crawling under the table . We just paid and left in shock . Before we left we told the crew but they didn’t comment at all. So we won’t be back
All the revie,"All the reviews are true about their delicious food, but more outstanding is their service, it was excellent."
Great service & great food,We were so impressed about their service and we've been happy about ordering what we've got recommend by restaurant! We believe the recommendation should be coming from their heart (not something try to sell us the most expensive thing from the menu) and we truly appreciated it. Special thanks to Mohammad (hope I spelled your name correctly) for your hospitality and service towards to us!
