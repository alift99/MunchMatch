Interesting young waiter,"We were served by an interesting young waiter with messy hair. He misheard our request and orders a few times and was not apologetic at all (with some attitude shown). While I can understand he is still young, but management can spend more time on training to uphold reputation."
Birthday dinner at PS Cafe Raffles City,"Food was good and ambience suitable to chilllax with friends.

Price of food on the high side though.

Overall it was a good experience."
Best Food & Service in Singapore,"This is just one of our favourite restaurants, excellent food quality and quantity, good beverage selection, superb service and awesome location. We return here every time we are in Singapore"
Service from some staff was not great,"As a frequent customer of PS cafe group of restaurants, I naturally chose PS Cafe as the meeting place for friends catch-up. However, for the first time ever, I did not have a pleasant experience. While I was busy settling down, one staff kindly asked if I wanted still or sparkling water. Caught by surprise as I usually will not be asked and just be served with normal water, I said “still” since I am not a fan of sparkling. To my surprise, it was a bottle of mineral water served. I looked around the neighbouring tables and none has the bottled water. I then told the staff I just wanted the normal tap water but was told off that I had requested for “still”. I said I wasn’t given a choice of “tap water” and I thought “still” means tap water since this is what I usually drink here if am not ordering beverage. The staff said there’s nothing he could do since the bottle was already opened and kept saying it’s their standard SOP that they will ask customer “still” or “sparkling” which to my surprise is the first time I have heard this despite numerous visits to PS cafes. A team leader/ senior staff then came to serve food and we provided the same feedback, hoping they can be more transparent to customers in future. Th senior staff kindly offered to take back the bottle given we have not touched it but again stressed this is their standard SOP. Overall, definitely not a pleasant experience as the message was not well put across. It’s not about the cost of paying for the bottled water but the way the issue was handled by the team. Fortunately, the food was still nice… also to highlight… a manager came over to help us take pic and make small talks with us and he had a great sense of humour which helped to lighten the mood."
Love the ambience!,"Food was great, service crew was accommodating! We had an awesome gathering at PS (RC). Love the black and white decor"
Slightly disappointing,"We tried truffle shoestring fries, crab tart, steak sandwich and double chocolate blackout cake. The truffle shoestring fries was packed with plenty of awesome cheese but lacked in truffle flavour. Crab tart tasted like crab but it was disappointing because it was dry and the texture is like steamed (not silky) egg. The steak in the steak sandwich is quite difficult to bite and cut through. Double chocolate blackout cake was SO GOOD - moist, rich chocolate and big slice (MUST TRY)!"
Excellent Concierge Service and Nice Food,I am impressed with their prompt response on reservation. Credit to Natasha and Yanna for their assistance. The atmosphere of the restaurant is so well.
PS..I love it,It's been my favorite cafe..need bigger menu...a bit pricey...should hv some discounts for regular patron...like us. Will come back
Pleasant Experience,I went with my date on a Saturday night and it was not very crowded which was what we wanted. The atmosphere and ambience were fantastic. Manager and waiters were all friendly and professional. Food was not bad too. Was just hoping that they could do with more variety of draught beers on tap.
Big breakfast at coffee academics is better,"Had the big breakfast 27$. Scrambled eggs, one bratwurst, a slice of bread and some bacon. Tastes ok but it should for $27. However it really is too little variety comapred to other big breakfast places like coffee academics"
Positive Experience,"It was a great and enjoyable time to celebrate my wife’s birthday at a place with great ambience, comfort and good food."
Dinner with long lost friend,"Caught up with my friend from Australia that I had not met since University days. Good ambience food and service, which really made our reunion experience memorable! Will definitely return to visit!"
Quality of food has dropped tremendously,My friend and I order the specials of the day . We had the portobello fries and the fish burger. These items were overly fried and dry. The portobello was tasteless. My friend had the fish and chip and the fish is not fresh and the chips is not crispy and tasteless. We had the cooler soda and ice tea but again another huge disappointment… totally tasteless!! My friend and I used to have very good food at the PS Cafe but this experience is a total put off !! Please do something to the food quality else I don’t think I am ever gonna step in again!!
Wonderful food as usual,Carbonara was very good as donesness of the pasta was Al dente . Black out double choc cake and Sticky date pudding with toffee sauce is my all time favourite ! Lucas the server was most friendly and personable. Thank you
Great food and service,PS Cafe has never failed me when it comes to their food standards and there were some trainees doing service that night who had such a great attitude. Kudos to them for still being all cheerful despite it being the end of the day.
Lucas is a star,"My first visit to PS Cafe, great service by Lucas and the female manager ensuring we got everything we needed before, during and after our meals.

Thank you both and to Lucas especially, such a sweet boy."
Food not as good as expected,"I had PS cafe at paragon, the food and ambience is very nice. At raffles city , the fish and chips are not fresh, and that the food was cold."
PS cafe at Raffles city - lunch,Service is not efficient despite paying for service charge. Food is ex - does not warrant the price I paid for- will not go back to any Ps cafe
not for me,"they should just turn off the fans. making me nauseous as the fans are located under the light casting spinning shadows on customers. and they are not even generating wind at that lowest speed set. just aesthetic.
ordered the crab tart but the sauce was soup. crab tart tasted like plain omelette tart.
service is good thou, very accommodating and changed my table otherwise i think i would have puked from the nauseous caused by the spinning shadows"
Phoebe’s Dining Experience at PS. Cafe Raffles,"Their Filipino staffs are exceptional! At first, I was greeted by the manager, Toni who ushered me to my table. Then he even offered to transfer me at a better spot which I love because I asked him first if it was Instagrammable (lol) and he said yes! He actually did that because there was a group next to my table and since it’s a group, they’re a bit loud hehe. So I highly appreciated Toni offering me that way. Also, server Paul who’s also a Filipino, offered me to take some photos and since I went there solo, I appreciated it too. The place is really a must-visit, because it’s a high-ceiling resto that has a French vibe with many plants and its so pleasing to the eyes. It’s in the middle of the mall and you won’t realize that it’s only a one-storey resto because it’s huge. Good for meetings, dates or any special occasion. 10/10!"
Nice Food Lovely Ambience,The food is nice as usual and the ambience is lovely and conducive for an informal business meeting over meals.
Welcoming!!,"The welcoming not so great! They start by telling you how long you are able to stay, even though you are having a meal and perhaps you are going to order more things. I noticed that they tell certain people and certain people stay just drinking coffee. Very unpleasant welcoming."
"Convenient, good food, simple casual fare","Was here for Tuesday lunch. Great atmosphere, food was good. I had my usual king prawn aglio olio and wasn't disappointed. Not too crowded at lunch time. Perfect for a casual, easy catch up with clients. A bit noisy though so won't be ideal if you are looking for a quiet lunch venue. My dessert was chocolate cake and ice cream, the portion was more than generous. Recommended to order still or sparkling water for the glasses used for tap water served were not really clean I found dust inside the glass and asked to replace only to get a second cup with a piece of lettuce in it!"
Service at PS Cafe Raffles City,"With staff shortage, staff appears impatient and service was appalling. As a paying customer, deserve some service and not pushing me to give up table when I am in the midst of a serious discussion."
Did you say Chicken?,"Singapore is known for chicken rice. But when it comes to roast chicken, PS Cafe has got it down to perfection. From the skin to the breast meat and even right down to the bones. The thigh was nicely cooked through while the wings are not overdone. What amazes me was how juicy the breast meat was. I’m not a fan of breast meat but if everyone can cook it like PS Cafe did, I’ll gladly switch to this healthier choice.
PS Cafe never disappoints, though I wished they would bring back an item from when they 1st started their very first cafe within their retail outlet, Project Shop, at Paragon - the Tau Kwa burger."
Excellent customer service!,The entire staff at the Raffles city branch are all friendly and accomodating. We will definitely comeback to dine in again!
Dreadful,"Friends and I have sadly watched the decline of this franchise for a number of years now. But we thought hey, let’s give it a go and went anyway. A massive departure from its early days when it was just a cafe at the back of the then Project Shop Blood Brothers store in Paragon. Clueless staff (when asked what was available for a celiac, the server returned from the kitchen with a message from the chef assuring us no celeriac was on the menu. Good to know). Was told our guest could have the impossible burger without the bun. When we asked how was the actual burger made, not even the chef seemed to know. An indication that a great deal of the food comes out of a box or at best, the freezer. Yucks. Another sad case of a restaurant (using the term very loosely here) has absolutely no real regard for Celiac Disease and no clue when it comes to gluten free options. Don’t get me started on the level of staff knowledge, quality of the food we could see being delivered or anything else this sad, overpriced establishment had to offer, we simply left and went elsewhere. After being an avid supported for almost 20 years, we’ve given the place a good nudge but we will not be returning. Spread the word. Shocking."
Dinner,"I recently had a birthday dinner at the restaurant however, I felt that there were some areas that could be improved. The lady who escorted us to our seat was very friendly so plus point for that. The guy who took our order was friendly but he was in a rush which we totally understood as it was the peak hour. Food was delicious. However towards the end of our meal I asked twice for our water to be refilled but no one came to us. Unfortunately that what made me feel service could be improved as we were totally ignored even though they were not that busy. Overall, I would come again just at a different location."
Good ambiance,The food was okay but overpriced. The penne was not Al dente and the prawns were tough. The mint and lime was poorly presented
"Lunch at PS Cafe, Raffles City",Great food! Great service! Great ambience! Look forward to my next visit to this restaurant. Thank you for a wonderful experience.
Great Ambience but overpriced food,"Great place to host that gathering be it with friends, family or business. The food was overpriced and not delicious. I ordered Thai Chicken Basil and it was not authentic at all. Tasted sweet instead of savoury."
Service needs improvement,"Their service needs to improve. Only one kind waiter, Jeorold attended our requests all the time. The others are either sarcastic in her remarks or not attentive at all."
Wonderful Experience,"My friends were first timers to PS Cafe and they were pleasantly surprised at the beautiful atmosphere< with even bird songs piped into the restaurant
The food was good as usual, we ordered Mee Goreng, Ribs, Roast Chicken, Ginger Pudding and Key Lime. The ribs were succulent, and the ginger pudding+key lime were not overpoweringly sweet.
The signature truffle fries did not disappoint.
Service was also top notch. Thanks for making the experience a truely wonderful one. This is the reason why I recommend PS Cafe for many of my gatherings"
Excellent Service & Food!,Great ambience & food! Booked reservation weeks prior to dining. Restaurant was fully booked on a weekday lunch. Walk-ins are not allowed. Respect for the service and food too.
Dinner,Had dinner with my family there but the food quality had dropped. The service was slow n inconsistent. Ordered 2 bottles of still water with 3 cups but only 2 cups came with a small slice of lemon. The 3rd cup without lemon.
Mediocre at best,"I had quite a terrible dining experience.
1) The waitress who sat us down suggested to start us with iced water. She went ahead to open a bottle of mineral for my party.
2) Waiter was not attentive at all.
3) The standard of the food has also declined.

Overall, it was a negative experience."
1st time coffee date,I did my coffee date at PS.Cafe@Raffles City and it was super amazing! My date loved it too! Superb service and the dessert was sinfully delicious! Will be back for more!!
Nice place to chill in the heart of the city,Nice place to chill after shopping of sight seeing in the city. Mix of international and local dishes. Quality is good but priced on the higher side. Nothing really unique or a signature that I can recall. Service staff were professional and polite and attentive.
Kind of disappointing,"The place has a nice setting. Food is good. But the reservation process was a bit disappointing. There were 2 occasion to elaborate.. First, the lunch was supposed to happen at 12pm. It got push backed to 12.30pm. So amendment was made online. The next available slot was 12.45pm. Proceed to take the slot as it's understandable during lunch hours. Proceeded to call the concierge to highlight and requested to let the restaurant know to take note on getting a table ready at 12.30pm. The concierge was not really helpful. Only emphasized they are fully booked at 12.30pm and no further assistance rendered. I believe tables are not reserved right at the opening hours and left empty until the guests arrived. Arrangement can be made when you have a table that is likely to vacate nearing the next reservations, Believe this is how reservations are managed.

The next unpleasant moment on the second lunch appointment was when the guests are abruptly asked to leave, citing their time is up. Remembered clearly there wasn't any indication that there is a lunch hour limit. The abrupt ending of the lunch, didn't sit well. It left a bad experience.

From experience, believe PS.Cafe is fairly nice place to go to for catch up, meetings, celebrations, etc. The rating given for service don't truly speaks for all other staff. A few bad traits is going to affect the image though. Moving forward will appreciate more care will be put in."
Service is Great. Superfood Salad is not.,It was not the usual Super Superfood salad. Perhaps the supply chain woes have hit this particular branch of PS Cafe. The wonderful variety of greens in the past have whittled down to wilted lettuce and some unidentifiable greens sitting soggily on a bed of white (later identified as Miso) flavourless dressing. Please bring back the Super Superfood Salad or please bring back the chef that did it well. Thank you.
Nice ambience,Good place to chill and hangout. Wish they could take note of the special request as it was suppose to celebrate my Godbro's birthday.
Food and ambience is great,"It was a birthday dinner for my husband. We didn’t have to wait to get our seats. Food is great, but waiter could be more friendly."
Worst service cafe EVER !!!,"The waiter that serves us had a very grouchy face as though we shouldn't be there which was so uncalled for.

Can see that the manpower is really an issue. We waited for quite a while for someone to notice us and come take our orders (grouchy waiter), maybe because we were all wearing mask, so cannot see whether he is smiling or not But his tonality certainly put us off. Then when we wanted to order our coffee, we feel that he literally ignored us and pretend to be busy with other things: walk past us yet pretended not to see us waving at him."
Makan with friends !,"Thank you for the easy way to make reservation through Chope and we have a good time with good food , good service and good fellowship !"
Short-handed n strange food combination,"Can see restaurant was short of staff, staff was grumpy n looked stressed, overall unfriendly. Sticky ribs served on top of cold salad quickly made the ribs turned cold. The dish was re-served. Unless u like your ribs served cold, best to upfront ask for separate serving."
Hot drink is not hot,"Order Chai Latte , ingredients are prana chai tea, soyamilk and manuka honey, requested HOT drink, very disappointed that the drink come in room temperature.
Order simple drinks and waited for 25 minutes, remind staff to get my order."
"Surly, pushy servers","I get it that there is a manpower crunch in Singapore’s f&b scene. But it should also be noted that we pay a service charge (this is not a debate about tipping).

When I arrived for my networking dinner, the server told me “your friends are inside” without even showing me where. I hadn’t even met them.

I wonder if servers earn commission on alcohol. We were interrupted no less than 3x by a very eager (euphemism for pushy) staff. Please lay it off.

Topping the poor service were
surly staff who dampened our dining experience.

My group has declared we won’t be returning to this branch. Prices, we note, have also gone up."
Standard dropped,"1st: Birthday wording supposed to be Blessed instead Happy
2nd: placing order in Roasted Chicken was dry and not tender
3rd: Seafood angel hair spaghetti doesn’t taste like Aglio Olio"
Good evening,"My friends and I had a great dinner time on 20 April & we rewarded ourselves at the end by sharing 3 desserts among us. The sticky date pudding was great as always! Our dining experience was complimented by Paul, our friendly and attentive host. Thank you Paul and PS Cafe."
Good email reminder with regards to the booking made,It's good that your site has sent email reminders regarding the bookings made. This will ensure confirmation from both ends:)
Expect the unexpected,"Had the most expensive Laksa in town $28. Was expecting many ingredients stated on the menu for this bowl of Laksa. I think Laksa at Hawker Centre, $4~5 worth has more ingredients and taste much nicer then in P.S. Cafe. Didn’t want feedback or anything coz the staff attitude is bad. Just let it go and walked out. Not going back again.."
Fabulous place,The food and staff is fabulous. They were very attentive to customer's need and the deco was very chill and nice. seat provided was very suitable for business chat. Will definitely go back again.
Nice place but very poor service,"Was met at the entrance by a male waiter who told me to wait and left me standing when I saw tables inside. As I was early for my appointment, I was told to return the table in 90 minutes regardless what time my client arrived. The feeling was very negative and I didn't feel welcome at all. Could be the last time I patronize the restaurant."
90 minutes dining time limit?,Is it really necessary to remind customers upfront that there is a 90 minutes dining time limit? It is so annoying and mean and leaves a very negative impression on customers.
Poor service on hostess,"Overall experience in food, ambience is good. The service staff that assist for our table is friendly and efficient. The hostess on duty is horrible with her rudeness of service."
Unfriendly staff and service,"I never get the worse dining experience in Singapore, PS cafe in raffles city is the first one!!! Unfriendly staff especially Marvin who are guide us to the table, food just normal with five star hotel price. Only the cafe is nice design, overall keep your money and go other cafe."
Awesome food and service,"Went to PS Cafe @ Raffles City with my friends, first that caught me was the ambience, cosy gardens style with high ceiling. Very relaxing, and not too crowded. Service was good as well as the food too!! Kudos to the manager and staff! Keep it up!"
Good Food.Nice Ambiance. Good Service,"The food was superb. I especially like their double chocolate cake and their carbonara. The restaurant has good ambiance with its high ceilings and nature inspired decors. And most of all, their staff was attentive to customer's needs.

Will definitely come back!"
Disappointing Service - Hopefully an Exception rather than a Norm,"Been to this branch of PS Cafe multiple times and today’s experience at lunch was the worst. Quality of the food and drinks is good as expected. But service? The reception was cold and almost nonchalant. The lackadaisical table service is wanting and disappointing. Then my Chope reservation was marked as a ‘no show’.

Our request for water was not acknowledged, unless the sharp about body turn of the wait staff upon the request was the response. A request for ketchup to go with the burger and fries served was met with the hand. And the table next to us had to ask for their bill thrice .

Perhaps the wait staff are stretched? Still, some semblance of warmth or acknowledgement like ‘sure’ or ‘please give us some time’ would be appreciated."
Worse Reservation Ever,"The pasta and truffle fries were no doubt great. However the service given by the male manager was so bad. From simply ignoring us to pretending our order had been forgotten, I believe perhaps you should go to another PS Cafe for better service. However, the female server was great. She was polite and thoughtful."
Great brunch,"Went for brunch in the late morning.

Service was excellent by the ladies, they were attentive and friendly.
Food was great as usual and portion are big.
The coffee were normal."
Excellent,Very pleasant dining experience with my clients. Wi certainly bring my other clients n friends over again.
Worth the food if with reservation,If you go over without reservation then no worth the wait. However if you went with a reservation then everything is just fine
Lunch at PS cafe Raffles City,"The service staff were slow, we wait for quite a while after signing to the staff to help us take our orders. Probably 10 mins before someone came near and we asked again to take orders.

Food were salty based on my taste bud."
Dinner on 27 Dec 21,"The ambience was at its best as usual. However, the serving of fries with steak was too much. It was more than half of the plate."
Bad service,The manager repeatedly reminded us that they needed the table back even though we had made reservations beforehand and it was not peak period for the cafe (mid-afternoon after lunch period). We were confused as there were many empty tables around and no queues at the entrance. One waitress actually rolled her eyes at my dining companion who asked for hand sanitiser to sanitise his hands before the meal. Utterly rude service staff. Overall bad experience.
"Good service, but quality of food was rather poor.","Worst fish and chips I ever had. Served in 3 pcs, with 2 pcs not crispy, to the extent of soft outer layer. Fish inside was stale and taste terrible. Will not visit again."
Nice quiet ambience,I have been going to PS Cafe for years now. I still like the earlier years menu. The current menu is too boring and narrow. That has been one of the key reasons why i stopped going to PS. But their ambience is hands-down one of the best.
Can be better,Service was good and prompt but the food quality has reduced. Not as tasty anymore. Not value for money as food taste seems normal. Will probably only go for drinks or convenience
Dinner at PS Cafe Raffles City,Good service provided by staff. Nice ambience. Love the lighting and decor. Food and cakes are great.
Service and Food are Good,"The waitresses service is fast, efficient and friendly. The food are delicious and the deco of the cafe is very pretty and nice."
Friendly crew and great food,"It was nice venue for me to catch up with my religious teacher.
Foods were good and the service crew are very helpful"
Very pleasant,Was glad to be able to get a table at the Raffles City outlet to enjoy a very pleasant dining experience
Excellent food and friendly staffs,"Always love dining at PS Cafe. Reservations and chking in were a breeze.Food was excellent as always. And the staffs were friendly and gave good recommendations of a current drink, Berry Soda. However, wish PS Cafe will bring back the Laska Pesto Pasta. It was my 1st love at PS Cafe."
Nice ambience,"Staff are friendly and food is great. If there’s one complaint, the mains variety needs to be more extensive."
Excellent,The ambience was nice over there. The food was excellent and staffs are friendly and helpful. Will definitely go again
Excellent service by Chaki,"Coffee good , door stop cake good and service by Chaki was excellent!
From the start ,Chaki greeted us with warmth and friendliness! And his service throughout was excellent ! Makes our dining experience so enjoyable!
Thanks Chaki"
Great place to chill,The service is good and warm welcome. The food served fast and taste great. Especially Chati is really friendly and lift up the spirit up.
Dinner at PS Cafe Raffles City,Food is terrific. Just that service could be improved. But I guess the cafe is also short handed. Therefore fully understandable. Overall we still enjoy the dinner. Thank you to all of the staff attended to us.
Overall Pleasant Experience,The cafe wasn't too noisy and the staffs were very approachable. Overall dining experience was good. Wish there could have more options for the food in the future :)
Terribly Unpleasant Experience,"Total lack of courtesy & basic customer service. Even Mcdonalds has much better service and they don’t even levy a service charge!

All staff were already preparing to close 1.5hours before by asking for bill at 8.30pm before orders were served and by keeping stuff on tables and interrupting conversations, and not wanting to top up water even when requested!

Customers being asked to leave 30min before published closing time at 10pm is unacceptable!!"
Great food & service!,Service staff was attentive and friendly. Order spaghetti and truffle fries - portion & taste is as usual - very good! The seating well spaced out so there is safe distancing between the tables.
Raffles City Branch,"Rude, abrupt, bad attitude of staff
Lacking basic level of service
A terrible letdown
Do not recommend at all"
Lunch at PSCafe Raffles City,Nice lunch here with a good menu. The PSCafe wagyu burger was delicious. Service is very good. Happy overall with the visit
"Good, but not as advertised","We made a reservation because of a food item on the menu. When we arrived, we were told that the particular item was no longer being served. Even though it was advertised, it was not being served. Not really great for a restaurant to operate this way"
Excellent service & food,Was served by Chaki & we had an excellent time there. His service was exceptionally superb! Would definitely come back to be served by him!
Worth visiting but good to make reservation in advance.,Went there for tea break with friends. Nice ambience. Seafood basket is delicious. Staff very friendly and attentive to customer's request. Will definately visit again
Dinner Reservation,Enjoyed our dinner there. Welcomed with great service by Yoba & a male Filipino staff but Ashley was rude and ruined the experience for us.
Thank you for being honest,Went to restaurant and have a relaxing afternoon tea . The staffs are friendly and helpful . Left my iPad on the table when I left and Meena call me to go back and retrieve my iPad just before I left Raffles city . Thank you Meena for taking the trouble to call me and save me the trouble and hassle of looking fir my iPad
Feedback,The environment is nice and the foods are tasty in reasonable price. Staffs was very friendly and helpful.
Bday Dinner visit,Chaki and Sharlene gave very good service even though it was peak hour. Great Job! Very happy with my birthday meal here.
Birthday dinner,"My friend & I had dinner at the RC outlet celebrating her birthday. Had an enjoyable dining experience, food is great & fast seating. All thanks to the attentive & great service by Sharlene & Chaki. :) keep it up!"
Sumptuous Food and Amasing Service,Friendly crews. Food were served on a timely manner. This is one of my favorite place with my comfort foods
Ps cafe at Raffles City - kudos to Chaki!,"Hostess and Chaki the server was warm, efficient and genuine! Truly a great experience!! Keep up the amazing spirit especially to Chaki!"
Great service and food,Celebrating my husband’s birthday at PS cafe (Raffles Place). Nice ambience and great service by Chaki! Would definitely be back again ◡̈
Great service and decor,Service was great. Food is on the pricier end. Had the king prawn aglio olio and the portion was pretty generous. Blackout chocolate cake would be better with two scoops of ice cream -- one scoop isn't enough to pair with that huge slice of cake.
Good food and friendly staff,Love the ambiance and the food. Enjoyed the exchanges with Ashley too. She was really friendly and cheerfully helped us take our pictures without complaints even though she was clearly very busy.
"Great Ambience, Friendly Service",Was early for my reservation and was promptly seated by friendly staff. Love the indoor alfresco dining at this outlet. Burger and truffle fries were good and portions generous! Would have loved to end with desserts too but will save for another visit :)
Cozy and Relaxing Ambiance!,I have patron PS Cafe often and I have always loved their service and food. It’s my first time at Raffles City though and it’s not at all disappointing. Their staff were so welcoming and my friend and I had a fantastic time there. We were especially entertained by a staff named Ashley. Excellent service and Ashley even went the extra mile to make my birthday cake more pretty with candle and topper. Thank you for the wonderful experience. Highly recommended! Will definitely visit again.
P2HA EXIT CELEBRATION!,Four long time friends finally met for lunch after the P2HA! Had an enjoyable lunch! Good ambience! Excellent service especially Ashley Good to have some promotion available especially for seniors like us!
