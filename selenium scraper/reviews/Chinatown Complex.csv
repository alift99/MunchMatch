Smelly but great variety of food!,"5 for experience. 2 for smell. 2 for cleanliness. 5 for food experience if the fish smell doesn’t overwhelm you from the basement. 2 if it is hot and the smell from the wet market from the basement get up to the second floor food stalls. Dirty stair case as there were many cigarette butts. Tables not cleaned well. Lack of hand washing facilities except at the bathrooms which is hard to find. You definitely have to go here to find the rarer asian sweet treats. The Malasian Masi Lemak is delicious and cheap at $3 a plate, compared to $20 at a sitdown white cloth restaurant. Take for granted that the $20 portion included leg and thigh, and the $3 portion just a wing! But the essential taste is there! That is what I love about street market or little stalls - getting a mouthful of flavors for 1/5 of restaurant price! If you want fresh vegetables and fruits, you have to go to the basement where they also sell fresh meat and fish. Explaining why it is wet and smelly!"
"A complex with huge varieties of many good hawker food, an interesting wet market & many affordable products....worth a visit!","Chinatown complex comprises 3 floors. An interesting wet market at basement ( worth a visit), lots of small shops on ground floor & the biggest hawker centre in Singapore on the 2nd floor. Lots & lots of different & delicious types of local & asian food are found here. Avoid coming at lunch time as the place is usually fully packed with long queues for the popular food & no empty tables. Also avoid coming on Mondays as many stalls ( including the market ) are closed ( rest day ). If not sure what is good, just go to those stalls with the long queues."
Insane maze,This is place is an insane maze of food clothes and all sorts of stuff I can’t explain but its good to have a wonder round and have a look
Contains a good hawker centre,"We visited this complex for the good hawker centre which is busy and popular with locals.

We ate at Hawker Chan which was great and we also had some pineapple fried rice from the Thai store and servings were large. Prices are very good.

It did notice many clothing stores on the ground floor."
The daddy of all hawkers!,"Best selection, best atmosphere, best location…it’s great here. Be prepared to join a queue for the best stalls but I can pretty much guarantee you’ll enjoy what you do order. Since I first came here 11 years ago, a few new craft beer stalls have even opened too, which is a good development to widen the appeal I think. Today I had the best char kway teow I have ever had, anywhere, yum!"
Where most street food in singapore can be found,"This is where most of the street food in singapore comes together in one location. There are many famous local stalls here as well. Though crowded most of the time, this is where originally the food culture in singapore started, at small street stalls and food centers.

Can get hot and humid at times but this is also what makes it nostalgic. You can find your usual street food like chicken rice, Cha kway teow, satay, etc here and many stalls sell good old school coffee. Some of these stalls were here since day one and thus, in itself packed historical value and culture."
Zi char stall,"This is the first time we came here after covid suitation tends to relax more in Singapore. Definitely more ppl. We ate 123 zi char stall with 3 dishes: deep fried prawn paste chicken, salted pork ribs n chilli kang kong. All for 2 pax @ $30. Taste not bad. The lady who takes order is rude."
One of the BEST place for local food!,There are practically NO Ch!na d!$gu$t!ng food. Almost ALL local delicacies at low and affordable price. I'm a Singaporean and frequently visit this place for food. Recommended to visit!
Choke full of traditional food,Love this place as one can find lots of traditional food and some snacks here. It’s usually crowded during lunch time so come before or after.
28 Jan 21 (Thurs),"This is the first time, after Covid started in March last year, we came back here for dinner. Our main purpose is to buy ""lian gao"" & chinese sausage for CNY. We also ate the zhi char for $38 for two. Streets are very much quieter than last year. Much lesser people around 530pm.... Government does not allow the street stalls to open this year. Hence, lesser crowds...

Things"
One of the Top Food Centre in Singapore,"Outside of Amoy, Hong Lim, this Chinatown Smith Street food centre is probably one of the best if not already the best Food Centre. Besides Michelin recommended Hawker eats, this food centre also has the highest amount of Hong Kong food by Hong Kong immigrants to Singapore pre 1997. Many settled here and brought their great food and culinary skills. Must try here are the Benji Claypot Rice, Fatty Ox Beef Briskets, no frills Mongkok Dim Sum and Ma Li Ya Virgin Chicken, Hong Kong style soy sauce based, and forget the other one, the Michelin hailed and now becomes just a syndicate food, don't say I didn't warn you. Local contenders include the Shi Xiang Hainanese Satay, the best in Singapore, duck rice and Hokkien Mee. The great thing about hawker centres are the great value and cheap local eats."
Lian He Ben Ji Claypot Rice,"This stall serves the traditional dish-clapot Rice, tasty Rice and chicken meat and chinese style dried meat together. Other products are chinese soups. Great taste everything. Pricing are even can see your smile. Remind that stall would closed on every thursday."
Cheap and good local food,"The hawker stalls are on the second level with all the local delights you can think of. We ordered chicken rice, yam cake, char kway teow ( fried noodle) which taste very delicious and these are the Singapore favourite that would never go wrong. Level one is a wet market where you can buy fresh fish, meat and fruits. Its a good place to learn more about the local's way of life."
Hawker stalls,"It’s probably one of the least hygienic places I’ve eaten, but without question, this is one of the best places in Singapore to get your fix of local food fare from hawker stalls. Most of the food stalls are on the 2nd floor, while the ground floor is mostly shops. Many of the food stalls remain open late into the night. Every imaginable classic Chinese/Singapore dish is available from at least one of the stalls. The shops on the 1st floor (ground floor to the British) are closed by evening though."
Food stalls on the second floor,"Many stalls were closed due to Chinese new year, but the selection was still good. I tried Singaporean traditional carrot cake (which doesn't have anything in common with the sweet British version) and I liked it. It's funny how cheap the food is in these markets, I only paid 3SGD for a meal."
"So many stalls, can get lost.","So many stalls, can get lost. Too busy. Go try for yourself. We shared a table with two lots of people while we were there."
Date of visit : 12Jan20 Sunday,"Bring our mums to eat at HK""zhi char"" stall on second floor. 5 of us cost us $98. Cheap,nice, filling.

Then bring our mums go shopping for their new year clothings. N also buy some new year goodiness at CNY Smith Street stalls n ""Ta Zhong Gao"".

But we need to walk to OG taxi stand to catch a cab as the south bridge road is too crowded n more difficult to catch a cab."
"Go to the second level, up the escalators!",The best food we had! Level 2 shop 135! Xiao Long Bao! Also the Omelette Chef next door to this was super lovely cheap and tasty for my Non Asian food loving son.
Start of a foodie tour.,"We were on a holiday without the kids, the first one in nearly 20 years. I was all set to spend a lot of time arguing/fighting in convincing the other half to go to the places I wanted to go. But bless her she decided that this entire holiday could be mine to decide where to go and what to eat. (Probably will end up paying a heavy price for this later on.)
The first morning was spent mindlessly wandering around Mustaffa Centre. When it was time for lunch we headed towards Chinatown. Specifically towards Hawker Chan. His claim to fame being that his stall was the first hawkers stall in the world to be awarded a Michelin star.
There was a decent sized queue of punters at his stall. Waiting patiently to be called up to the counter by a stern looking old lady. Had to wait for around 15 minutes to get to the top of the line.
The menu is very limited. There's a couple of choices of soy sauce chicken and char siew pork. Selected one of each and joined my wife at a quiet table.
She had gotten a couple of fruit juices to go with the food. The seating is bare and minimal. Tables and stools bolted to the floor. And yes there's birds flying around here too. I thought this was limited to Tekka Centre. But saw it at every hawker market that we went to.
The food was great. Slightly put off when I realised that it was not hot or warm. But then realised that they would be cooking the thing in batches and serving it, as opposed to cooking each to order.
The chicken was moist, tender and lovely. It did not need any of the sauces that were there along with the dish. The rice could have been better if it was hot. But was full of flavour. The char siew pork was sticky, tender and called for the fingers to be licked after eating it.
Was plenty happy with the meal. For the price that you pay it really is amazing quality that you get."
Very specific...,"It is big, lots of space, like a covered Chinese market. Lots of things... you can find here anything you need ( and don’t need). On the basement floor is local food with very specific smell... Actually food is everywhere.... on every corner :)"
Unusual- worth a quick if passing,"Wednesday 23rd October we walking around exploring and sightseeing in Chinatown where we found this shopping area. It is situated very near to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.

Even from the outside it looked unusual with its wavey canopy and brightly coloured panels along the front. It could not be classified as your typical downtown Mall.

The ground floor was a bit of a strange affair, it was row upon row of stalls in an enclosed arcade with modern lighting overhead and old fashioned street lights along the way.

The stalls on ground floor sold clothing, stationary, meat and vegetable market. It was all very colourful with Chinese lanterns and a plethora of red and gold decorations and bunting on display.

We visited here because of its proximity to the Temple, otherwise we might not have bothered.

We did not venture to food court upstairs."
Went for the food,"Stall 168 CMY Satay, rated best satay in Singapore. I thought it was ok, while my wife loved it.

Menu consists of three meats (chicken, pork, and mutton) and a small order of rice wrapped in what seems to be banana leaf.

Satay comes with a mild peanut sauce that wasn’t too overwhelming and complimented it quite nicely.

It’s a good appetizer, otherwise order a lot because it’s not at all fulfilling. I’d recommend, but don’t think you should go out of your way for."
Top floor is the best for fabrics,"Go yo the top floor if you like textiles and fabric, great selection of fabric both for sewing and patchwork. Plus some blouses and dresses"
hawker food court,Big selection of food at the hawker centre and prices are so reasonable. Very noisy and busy but a must to dine there and soak in the amazing atmosphere.
"Great food, cheap prices.","If your looking for a cheap and interesting place to eat in Singapore, this is it. and I mean really cheap. With over 260 small food stalls to choose from its hard to decide, generally look for the busy ones with lots of locals lining up because they rarely line up. Had a great time, a must visit whilst in Singapore."
Capital of Nom,"Are you in chinatown? Is your stomach in working order? Do yourself a favor and wander around in chinatown complex (first floor). Get in line where there are a lot of people waiting (and you are intrigued by the food) and with a bit of luck you will have a great experience. Order from a couple of places and put together your own buffet. It may be overwhelming, but the food is great, hygiene is top, and be part of the local way of consuming food."
Great food and really great prices,"This is a fun place to visit and try lots of regional dishes cooked in small stalls. You can find just about anything here. I had some shrimp fired rice that was some of the best ever.

It can and does get crowded during lunch and dinner times. Most of the vendors prefer cash."
Great food,This is a great place to come and try different foods and reasonable prices. There is a great kiosk selling durian make sure you try durian!
Spoiled for choices,"This is one of the bigger hawker centre found in Singapore. There are many no-frills and authentic local dishes like char Kway teow, chicken rice, etc. And most of the dishes tasted really good. A good place to soak yourself in the local dining culture."
Over 200 stalls,"This hawker centre is near the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum in Chinatown off Smith St near Eu Tong Sen St. The ground floor has clothes and a meat and vegetable market while escalators take you upstairs to a clover-leafed double-halled food centre with over 200 stalls. It became our go-to place for food in Singapore. Our favourite was the Ann Chin Popiah stall but there is a lot of variety with chicken rice, satay, rice and noodle dishes, etc. Some things we tried were great and others average. Look for stalls with long queues for great food. At one of the entrances is an open square which sometimes has impromptu local karaoke performers and competitions at night. This hawker centre is less touristy than the Maxwell Food Centre."
Good variety of cheap authentic hawker food,"There are 3 food centres within walking distance from each other (Maxwell, tanjong pagar and chinatown).

This hawker centre has the most authentic food and the cheapest. There are many old traditional stalls. You can identify then from the super long queues (we went on a sat morning).

As a tourist visiting chinatown, you should give this hawker centre a try, instead of eating from other stalls inside chinatown (very expensive). It is also a good representation of hawker food around singapore.

There is also a wet market at the basement. You can walk to the very end for more exotic meat e.g. crocodile, frog, snake etc"
Chinatown Complex Food Court-Singapore,"Chinatown Complex Food Court-Singapore: - Foods is cheap, suitable for visitors with low budget - Clean - Many food stores - Next to Buddha Tooth Relic Temple"
Great Local food,"Of course you are able to visit Hawker Chan's stall and sample the food that has a 1 Michelin star rating, the line up is long but at least you can say that you have done it. The line moves quickly so not to worry.To be honest the food from Mr Chan was good but really no better than many other stalls near by."
Largest Food Centre in Singapore,"One can only be amazed by the number of cooked food vendors under one roof. The tables and stools may be a little too close for comfort but, there are allegedly over 200 cooked food stalls in this building, all on one floor. It can be extremely busy during the lunch periods, best time to visit is before 11.00am. In the basement are the fresh and dry grocery stall holders. On the first floor are all non-food stalls. An excellent Food Centre to visit, if just to admire all the varieties of hawker foods available in Singapore."
Its opened now...... back to good authentic local food at reasonable prices,"The long renovation is finally over. This place is opened now, since last Saturday.

Almost all of the original food stalls are still here, with few gone. Expect new ones to take over soon.

Not much has changed ""visually"" except a new paint job, new ( & more fans are installed, new screws on the stools & as I understood from one of the stalls, new drainage/piping has been done.

All our good old favourites stalls are still here ( see earlier reviews)."
lots of variety...,"A must visit for tourists. Best spot to get good affordable local meals. The complex itself is huge with so many stalls to choose from. Majority of the stall owners are friendly. Clean with lots of seating. Does get crowded during lunch time.

Notable stalls to try would be the The 1950s Coffee Wu Shi Nian Dai toast & coffee, Michelin star Hawker Chan chicken rice, Lian He Ben Ji Claypot rice, Ann Chin Popiah, Xiu Ji Ikan Bilis Yong Tau Fu & Old Amoy Cendol. To be honest I think any stall you try will be decent & worth the money."
"Closed indefinitely, stink of sewage","Yup, all closed up, even the taxi drivers didn't know Like a number of other 'attractions' In Singapore. Very modern city , but sadly lacking info about this.b see also art museum and Merlion"
"3 more days to enjoy wide varieties, great & cheap local food before it closes for 3 months major renovations...","This biggest hawker ( food) centre in Singapore will be closed for a long
3 months renovation from 01 March to 31st May 2019. Reopens on 01 June.

There are lots of very good local food here at local prices. More than 200 stalls offer wide varieties & choices.

Some stalls are already closed. But most will still be opened till this Thursday 28/Feb.

Don't miss this place if you are here in Singapore next 3 days.

Note that down on the same main street is the more expensive, limited choices & not so nice touristy Food Street.
This big hawker centre is located at Chinatown Complex - on the 2nd floor. It's different.

To get here, alight at Chinatown MRT station. Go up escalator at Exit A Pagoda Street. Chinatown Complex at Smith Street is 2 streets to the right of Exit A escalator."
Level 2 dining hall has a range of interesting local foods,"Meals are cheap and you have a floor full of dining stalls to line up at. It's a bit of a rat race but highly prized by locals and well worth enjoying. Not sure about the cleanliness of cups etc but staff are kept on their tippy toes meeting orders and the vibe is vibrant and very casual, with bench-style dining and fans to cool the heat somewhat. Worth a look."
Fantastic selection of food stalls - avoid the Chinatown street stalls and go here,Looking for food? Go upstairs and get lost in the maze of food stalls. You'll find a bit of everything the Singapore street food scene has to offer. There's a sizzling rice place that had an HOUR wait for the food to be cooked. I didn't have time to wait but it sure looked amazing. The quality is delicious and the prices are super reasonable. If you go out to the Chinatown streets you'll find the prices more than twice what they are here -- and more touristy. Afterward go get an egg tart at Tong Heng.
So delicious,"This is our first time in Singapore with my family, where looking a very affordable food and of course look good and then we saw it. Just try this, so delicious and good service. Anyway I recommend this to my friends also. Kudos to all staff!"
Friendly shopping,"Remarkably good & cheap shopping. Bath towels, etc - Level 1 - Shop No. 185. Good taste of Food court upstairs 👍"
Lots of food eateries,Was a bit put off by the smell on the street/first level but that changed when we reached the upper level where the ‘food court’ was. Lots of food eateries and very cheap. I had a veggie fried rice that was quite large for $4.
affordable and tasty food fare,"place to find very affordable and tasty foods. Wide range of food fare from exquistie dishes to basic down-to-earth snacks . It caters to all taste buds and discerning food lovers. Good craft beers could be found here , but only open after 6pm daily."
Insanely must-experience,"Only visited it for having lunch on the 2nd floor food court. The amount of food stalls and options is just incredible, you will definitely eat like a local - not for the gang hearted but to me an insane food experience while in Singapore."
"Close to Chinatown MRT, excellent food","This long established hawker centre has a local vibe to it as judging by clothing most of the people there are not tourists or officer workers. Located on the first floor above a traditional brics-and-bracs shops on the ground floor the dishes from here are the best I have eaten amongst all of the hawker centres in Singapore.

Prices are very reasonable considering its central location with most medium servings being around the $5 mark. There seems to be more seating area here compared to other hawker centres so you have a good chance of getting a table for yourself even at the lunch time peak hour. Chinatown MRT station is less than 200 metres away and it is also walkable from Outram Park MRT depending on what train line you're on. Another bonus is other tourist attractions like the Buddha temple and the street market at Smith Street is just outside the door. This will be my ""go to"" hawker centre the next time I'm in Singapore even if during a short layover at Changi."
The place to eat like a local,"Went here for lunch a couple times. This place is home to hawker chan, the famous 1 Michelin star food hawker. If you're in Singapore, come here for some ways and a beer."
Lunch on 2 November 2018,"It is hard to find Herbal Bak Kut Teh in Singapore and so my lovely friend Connie started this stall in Blk 335, 02-119, Smith Street Hawker Centre, Chinatown Complex, Singapore 050335.

The soup is really delicious. Very flavourful and I’m not writing this compliment just because she is a friend. In fact, I only got to know about her stall only recently in September 2018 even though she started this stall a few yrs ago. There’s lots of good stuff in her soup like wolf berries, Japanese mushroom, local lettuce and there is absolutely no msg! The pork bones with some flesh are also tender and the flesh comes off the bones easily. She also cooks other yummy dishes. I especially like the thinly sliced squid and okra fried together with marinated chicken slices. Absolutely yummy. . Do try her stall and if U run out of the delicious soup you can ask her for more. No need to pay extra $ for more soup! Enjoy !!!"
Don & Udon is excellent,"I chose this as I prefer seafood and it was conveniently located to the stall next to where the rest of our family ate.
I ordered ebbi & udon set for $5.50 it was prepared quickly, the butterfly prawns were on shredded cabbage with a delicious sauce. The udon noodles were hot and delicious.
Avoid the main tourist trap of China town food stalls, head to level 2 of Chinatown complex and eat local food with the locals."
Time has flies,"It has been some months since we last visited this place. So tonight we decided to go eat the ""zhi char "" on the second floor.

No specific stalls to be mentioned, but we always try the two stalls.

This time a total of 7 adults joining the dinner which cost less than $80. Still taste as good but place is cooling since evening and had just rained."
Come to open your mind and taste the foods of Chinatown,"Come at afternoon to feel the live of Chinatown. We came also to taste the different foods. Come to satisfy the stomache. Foods are clean and original. Donot be afraid that you will fall sick.Be adventurous and try new foods. Many stall keepers selling foods have cook for many years to keep themselves to survive
and are proud of their foods to serve. My family and I travel from Europe to come here to taste Singapore foods."
Delicious!,Looked like a favourite with the locals. Had Hainese Chicken Rice and it was amazing. Beers were available too. Love this type of eating and atmosphere. Definitely worth a visit if you like Hawker food.
Heritage,"House of the Michelin star soya sauce chicken noodle, steam song fishhead and many other traditional dishes that’s hard to find in other food centers. I find the place congested, having more stalls than there’s seats."
"Food, Fruit and Nik Knacks","I was only in the centre for one of the three in the title and that was the Hawkers Food Stalls on the first floor. The first floor is Excellent. Make sure your hungry..... wander round and eat to your hearts content for little monies. There should be something for all tastes. Main floor, clothes and trinkets. Basement fruit and some Hawker Food Stalls."
Must visit if you are a foodie!,"Head into the complex, go up to the 2nd floor and you will be greeted by rows of food stalls and tables+benches reminiscent of school days. All the food here is authentic Chinese food cooked by local families, for a super cheap price. Both food and drink are available here and you can easily stuff yourself with food for less than £5!
Recommendations: If you're unsure what to go for, head for the stalls with queues as these will no doubt be the most popular foods. If you're new to Chinese food, try the Hainanese Chicken with rice which looks simple but is a beautifully balanced and delicious dish (and only cost me ~£2)!"
So much food at affordable prices!,"My hostel recommended this place to me. Tucked in the 2nd floor of an old building, i wouldnt have found it otherwise. Best place ever for food, so many choices, i counted over 100 stalls. During my short holiday in Singapore i passed by here everyday for dinner."
Cheap meals with a great variety!,"Chinatown Complex is lined up with stalls and provide a great variety of different options from traditional Asian meals, Western cuisine and even drink stalls. On the other floors, there are also little shops for souvenirs and other items, but we didn't come here for that. We came here for the FOOD!

Meals here sit at a price range starting from as little as $2 SGD. And for anyone who is planning a visit, I highly recommend reading the Michelin guide to what is recommended for Chinatown as for there are several stalls here which have been given the recommendation. Along with having a 1 Michelin star awarded hawker stand (Hawker Chan), there are a vast array of other options worth trying too.

The only cons about the place was that there was no air-conditioning (but the electrical fans helped a bit), and the eating area was a bit dirty. But if you're okay with those things, then definitely give this place a visit!!

Food: 8.5/10
Comfort: 2/10
Cost: 10/10
Service: 3/10
Cleanliness: 3/10"
"Food, shop and dine at a Michelin Star","Chinatown Centre has so many shops, where you can shop for clothes, tidbits and favourite souvenirs. And, eat at the food court upstairs including the world's cheapest Michelin Star restaurant, Hawker Chan."
Excellent food,One of my favorite places to eat while in Singapore. Very local and very good food. Also a few good places to have a draught beer. Explore through the hundreds of food stalls and pick what you like. Difficult to say which is the best as they are all good!
Large choice of hawker food,"This place was heaving when we visited at lunchtime. Every hawker stall had a long queue. The table clearers were working at supersonic speed. Would definitely recommend a visit but, not during the lunch period."
Good food and shops,Was great walking through to shop at the various shops as well as eat at the stalls. People were friendly.
GREAR SELECTION OF SHOPS & RESTAURANTS,"The Chinatown Complex was a short walk from our hotel so we came every second day, enjoyed restaurants, bakeries and supermarket."
Mind boggling choices,"If you visit this place without anything specific in mind you'll be in trouble because the choices will be mind boggling! If you are patient you can try those stalls which seem popular. Our personal favourites are the tze char, Claypot rice and the desserts stall. You can literally eat till you drop!!"
"Diverse choices, affordable fare",My friend loves the Mala here and recommended it to me. The place is decorated modestly like a traditional hawker centre - tourists should come here to get a taste of the local cuisine and experience the authentic hawker centre vibes.
Many choices....,"Came here in search of Smith St. Taps which is located upstairs at #02-062. Found it after a bit of a search , it’s on an outer perimeter overlooking the street. Scored some roast duck rice and chicken noodles from stall 116. Pretty tasty. The Taps has great beer, although a bit pricey due to the “sin tax”. I prefer Tiong Bahru center for food and Chinatown for beer."
Great lunch!,"If you're not fussy about the decor etc, then this is a great place for lunch! We had pad thai (not sure which stall) which was really tasty and to quench our thirst, got Tiger beer from a stall opposite for $6. Was so good, we went twice!"
A cyclonic place for foodies !,"I named it Cyclonic as its a whirlwind for the hungry..... fast paced... smells... fire... noises... colourful sights. ....
Dont expect fancy food..... because they concentrate on flavour and tradition.. with each of the hundred stalls specializing in a particular dish or 2.
Cheap as chips !! Excuse the Pun..
Thousands of locals congress to enjoy but no other westerners when i was there but they were very friendly, and took time to explain some of the weirder dishes...
Recommend smith street market if your too afraid to jump into here feet first..... but hey if you dont test the water with both feet... you will never know how deep it is !!"
nice place,big complex in china town easy to find lot of different stuffs its a must to visit when you are here
Penang Chiak Ho Liao - Authentic Penang Food I was told,"This is a relatively new stall selling Penang food - Penang Chee Cheong Fun with shrimp paste, Mee Goreng and Nasi Lemak by my friend and her hubby in their 30s. My friend is from Penang.

Heard much rave from other friends who have tried their food and decided to try it myself.

I tried the mee goreng, something very different from the ones we have here. It contains fried beancurd, cuttlefish, eggs, peanut toppings, Chilli, fresh lettuce and a squeeze of lime. Before eating, I was told to mix it eventually like salad/ rojak so that I get a good mix of the flavour.

While enjoying my mee goreng, a lady originally from Penang who have live in Singapore for more than 40 years but still goes back to Penang a few times a year. She also ordered the mee goreng and when I asked her how authentic does it taste? She said good, better than some hawker in Penang now!! She said she'll be back to try other dishes.

Each plate of mee goreng is fried to order, so you can determine how much chilli you can take.

Chinatown Complex And Food Centre #02-182
Closed only on Mondays"
Delicious and cheap foods,"We visited around 8 in the evening when most stalls started to close and pack up. Still, we were able to eat Chicken Rice from one of the stalls. So far, it was the best chicken rice I have tasted and it is very cheap. I would love to try other food stalls next tine."
Big and endless choice food stalls under one roof,"Located on level 2 of the Chinatown Complex . You will be spoilt with choices of local food enjoy also by the locals . No air conditioned but ceiling fans provide good ventilation . Still can be hot after sometime . Everything is on self service basis .
Some stall like 1950’s coffee was even promoted by Michelin Guide in 2016 . Another famous stalls is the Yong Tau Foo ( assortment of fish balls wrapped with bean curd skin or vegetables like ladies finger , eggplant , capsicum etc ) - expect long queue for this stall
All kinds of street food selling in Singapore could be found here
A great experience indeed
Very cheap in pricing ."
Experience how the locals eat,"A great way to expense the local food, and chat with the locals. Our 2 meals cost $7! A large bottle of Tiger €6.30. But this is not just about cheap food but where the locals eat. Hawker Chan closed - ran out of food, so a local took us to another stall which served excellent food."
"Vegan Chicken Rice, Laksa and Lots of Chili!!!","Amazing food at hawkers market prices. We ate at An Xin Vegan. The ""chicken rice"" with ginger was the highlight. If you love chili let them know and they'll be more than happy to set you up with plenty! The owners were fantastic."
Inexpensive food,Located in Chinatown the cuisine is mostly Chinese food which is quite inexpensive as its a food court
Collection of shops and food,"Just by the tooth relic museum/temple, this is an old building with 3 floors - basement wet market, ground floor sundry shops, 2nd floor food centre. Very rustic and average"
Old Amoy Chendol a Delightful dessert stall in Chinatown complex,"New to Chinatown complex at #02-008 is Old Amoy Chendol, a favourite dessert from South east Asia. It's a combination of shaved ice, green rice drop jelly, palm sugar, coconut milk and sweetened red beans. Simple and yet a very finely balance of sweet and savoury meets the palate. One of the better ones I have eaten. This stall sells only this wonderful dessert, so they certainly know how to do a good one. A delightful gem of a place to visit when in Chinatown Singapore."
Best Local Food,"Singapore is known for its Food Centers... Chinatown Complex is rated one of the best in Singapore where u can find local food. You can try steam fish, chicken wings, etc... But just don't miss Claypot and Sugracane juice."
It could not be more authentic,"Being with, amongst and in midst the local Chinese people we ate like they do. We ate Cantonese duck twice and one water spinach and pak-choi. All was fresh, Chinese purity and clean. Very appropriate prizing. We enjoyed the heat and the smell."
Breakfast on a Sat morning (7.30am),"If you're looking for some local delights this is a great place to visit... Did not realise the Michelin soya chicken is at this place, but it's only open later from 10.30am onwards.

We arrived at 7am and had food from random shops - laksa, prawn and pork tail noodle, chwee kueh just to kick start the morning. Can't remember the name of the stalls but they were good to fill us for breakfast.

The ambience is not the best - typical market like food court, don't go if you are not used to it... But you're missing out if you don't....

Don't forget to bring a pack of tissue paper.. We forgot and it seems so difficult to find a store that sells it... Ended up buying at the public toilet in the same building..."
Great food,"The hawker centre on the second floor has some fantastic food, cheaper than out on the street. The variety is as good as anywhere we have eaten. Downstairs there is plenty of shopping so you could spend quite a bit of time here. There is a nice bit of street art near the entrance, as there now is in a number of places in and around Chinatown"
'Wet' market,"Was in Chinatown so I thought that I'd go through this building. It was an interesting experience. A semi-typical fish market. There were many kinds of fish and shellfish, frogs and turtles available for food. Some if it was even on ice. Very wet floor so be careful with wearing sandals. It would be a good place to buy fresh fish certainly."
The best place for hawker food,"Forget the street level places, this is the very best place to sample the best hawker food in Singapore. Take the escalator to the second level, and you will be astonished by the variety of food, and the quality. This is where the locals eat, and it is busy all day. We ate late, around 7 pm, but most of the stalls are still open, and you can get a nice cold beer to go with your meal. The cleanliness is excellent, as all vendors are regularly inspected and certified. This is THE place to eat the best hawker food in Singapore. Try it while you still can - may of the people cooking the best food in the traditional way are in the older age bracket, and will be looking to retire in the next 5 to 10 years - so sample the true food of Singapore while they are still producing amazing traditional food from tiny kitchens."
Cheapest Porridge in Singapore - Tian Tian Porridge,Went here for a Friday lunch. It was especially crowded due to the Michelin star chicken rice. Went around and found this porridge store selling porridge at SGD$2.50 (USD$1.80) which makes it the cheapest porridge store in Singapore. The stall name is Tian Tian Porridge and it's hidden in a corner so happy hunting!
An experience and very good food,Went as part of a tour so I tried several different types of food. Also got to visit the wet market which was quite interesting. Put a tissue box on the table to save your place and try the lime juice. A must visit when in Singapore!
Great Place to Graze,"Unlike a few of the other hawker centres in Singapore, this complex is clean. The options here are the usual...chicken rice, duck, wonderful soups, and so forth. Just a great place to come and sample Singapore's varied cuisine for very little money. We arrived at about 11 before the real crowds. You'll be waiting in line much later than this."
Last day Y2017,"We (total 9pax) came here to have lunch at the hawker food Centre with one of the stall ""Hongkong Zi Char"". We ate the pork knuckles, sweet sour pork, pork ribs, fried chicken, fried veg, veg soup etc. Cost S$168.

Thereafter, we bought some clothes n shoes for my mum,Y2018 calendar, & dried medical stuff across the street.

Easily can spend up to 2.5hrs here."
Really nice lunch.,"The food area is on level 2 of this complex. There are many stalls to chose from and plenty of seating around. Have a wander to see what is around. I had a seafood fried rice, which was very good indeed. Take some wipes with you as the stalls don’t give out paper hand towels."
Yummy food,"We started off looking at the wet market in the basement. Very exotic foods that are not in offer at home!! The next floor up was cheap souvenir stalls. On level 2 was the huge Hawker Centre. So many stalls to choose from with such different dishes. Eve our vegetarian daughter ate well here. I had braised pork, my husband tried a kway char tay and my son had slow cooked “pigs leg” - all delicious. The only hint I would give people is to take tissues or hand wipes as there were no serviettes in offer."
Local delicacy Wan Wan deep fried dumplings,"Wan Wan Shanghai style deep fried dumplings situated at 02-93 in Chinatown Complex. They offer deep fried dumplings done until it turn Golden Color. Beside deep fried, they also offer steamed dumplings or soup dumplings. One of the best ingredients made by the shanghai lady who had modified it to the taste buds of Singaporean. Many people from Chinatown complex confirmed her dumplings is one of the best and I had send the dumplings to various friends for tasting."
Great valuable local food center,"Various valuable food to choose. Really local flavor for both locals and travelers. Satay is cheaper than Changji village. Fruit juice costs $1.2 only which would be the lowest juice price in SG. Fish head is $13 which portion will probably feed 2 adults with rice.
This hawker offers various beer also. Take some grilled chicken wings or satay or calamari with some beer and sit at night to enjoy the old time. It's a huge hawker. Travelers MÄY get lost. This hawker center is more valuable than those tourists stalls in smith street."
Local food!,"A place to visit when you are in Chinatown. Cheap eats. Try the local breakfast there in 1950 - toast with Kaya and butter, a cup of coffee and half boiled eggs to start off a new day!! Other than that, there are plenty of local delicacies you can choose there."

Chinese identity,"I have come to many Chinatowns in the world; this Chinatown Complex which I feel peaceful, not as shabby as in other countries and cities, but still retains its inherent characteristics."
Authentic Chinese Food,"Despite of the location (not clean), everything is great !!

Love the authentic taste and atmosphere of this food court.

i order fish ball soup with rice, from Super Mummy stall.

Great brooth, fresh fish ball, love it.

Also buy bakcang from another stall (forgot the name), and also delicious.

Europe/Singapore holiday 2017,"When you go to Singapore you have to go and eat here. I never miss this place when we go to Singapore.

As food courts go, this has to be the biggest, there are hundreds of food stalls. A word of advice, when you find a place to sit, and your partner goes to order the food. Take notice of the colour of the table as the tables are colour coded for different areas. Also take notice of where you walk as you will have trouble finding your way back to the table if you don't. If you get lost just look for the table colours and you will be in the general area.

I just love the Satay"
A must for authentic Chinese food.,"We stayed not far from Chinatown Complex and even though we only had 2 1/2 days in Singapore we had 3 meals here. BBQ pork and rice on our first night, noodle soup for lunch the next day then dumplings that night. Look for the queues for the dumpling place 2-135. Very efficiently run place and friendly people. Some stalls sold beer or boy from 7Eleven stores in nearby streets."
Authentic and delicious,Arriving in a hotel near Chinatown for a 24 hour stopover we took the advice of TA and went to the 2nd floor food court of the China town complex. Following the particular stall advice we went to stall 116 and had the duck pork and rice combo and the wanton special all for $10 AUD. We then found this place for the best steamed pork buns and dumplings $5 AUD. Delicious!
Great place,I was completely delighted to visit this area. Worth the time to walk around and enjoy all the foods and shops.
Wonderful,I love this place - lots to look around and lots of delicacies to try at reasonable prices. This place always feels full of energy which I love.
Tastefull,It is a building at the heart of china town in front of buddha tooth temple.the best places to eat in chinatown is this and the food road that called smith street.try to taste many different tastes.
