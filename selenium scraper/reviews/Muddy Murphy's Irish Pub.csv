Authentic British food here,A proper Irish pub that serves authentic British food and of course draught stout. English football was on the TV of all the corners in the restaurant. The snapper. fish & chips were tasty and not to be missed was the beef stew pie.
Authentic Irish Pub,"Nice ambiance, Spicy chicken wings were delicious. A nice simple Irish pub, convenient but overcrowded I guess we picked the wrong night due to Thursday Triva Quiz night. Staff very friendly and obliging. Overall, just other crowed Irish Pub."
The best pub in Singapore,"Good prices for central Singapore (expensive to most tourists, obviously). Lovely staff , many working here for twenty years, which speaks volumes for this Sg institution. A proper kitchen producing high quality, calorie-counted food. It‚Äôs simply the best pub in Singapore üëç"
"Crowded, expensive, and unappealing",No tables available because they were filled with yelling and screaming foot ball fanatics not even eating a meal. Absurd priced for drinks two pints $33!!! Standing room only.
Excellant,"Located in a side road off the top end of Orchard Road. Location is a major plus and I believe it periodically has live music.

Service was excellant, waiters were very friendly and food was received quickly. When food arrived they were of a decent size, so much so that both of us had difficulty finishing."
Has outdoor seating,"The Fish and Chips is simply great! Filleted whole Red Snapper crisply fried. The beef pie is not reviewed here, but it is good! With a strong taste of stout deeply marinated into the large chunks of beef and plenty of sauce.

Staff are rushed off their feet, but still find time to see us as humans rather than just patrons."
Amazing Shepherds Pie,Better than my Gran used to make. Very hot and wholesome traditional food. Tasty and full of flavor. Washed down with a perfect Guinness
"A proper pint of Guinness,","A proper pint of Guinness, a delicious Sunday Roast, what more can you ask for the day you‚Äôre released from quarantine. Very nice time with friends."
Sunday Roast a decent deal,Ok. It‚Äôs a pub so it centers around the bar but the food is decent and you can get decent pints on tap for reasonable prices in Singapore. We had the Sunday roast set meal which was yummy.
Like old times.,"Been here many times over the years and it's always been good, the staff are nice and the foods good. it's much better now that it's moved back to it's old location."
Nice quick pint,"Nice quick pint, fries and bread. All were delicious. A nice Irish pub, convenient and quiet. Not much more to say really."
Smoking in the covered area in prohibited smoking area spoils first class food,"I am currently sat in Muddy Murphy‚Äôs. We‚Äôve just had a lovely meal spoilt by the party on the next table smoking throughout our meal. It‚Äôs a clearly marked no smoking area!!!! It‚Äôs illegal to smoke in public areas in Singapore, but despite us eating the party were not challenged?? The food is first class but don‚Äôt sit outside in the covered area unless you want food spoilt by selfish smokers !!!"
Enjoyable,"Everywhere in the world you will find an Irish Bar. Muddy's is just one in Singapore but popular. Next door to the Orchard Hotel inside the small shopping mall. Friendly service, good food at reasonable prices and sometimes live music. Recommended."
Smokers in a No Smoking section. Waitresses ignored it.,"My family and I just finished eating at Muddy Murphy‚Äôs tonight. While the food was very good, there was a group sitting next to us who were smoking. There was clearly a ‚Äòno smoking‚Äô sign posted in the area. We complained to the waitress but the waitress just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and smiled and walked away. Two other tables ended up complaining and moving because the waitresses would not enforce their own rules. I was hugely disappointed in the waitresses behavior. I thought Singapore was a law abiding country?"
Medium choice... not something special,"The salad was ok.
The steak was small and not that good.
Apple cramble medium...

Overall it was something quite medium...

The are other options that are better in this range of money..."
At least Dick Turpin wore a mask!!,Very busy but EXCEPTIONALLY expensive. $16 (¬£10) for I pint of TIGER! Trust me- I'm going to make it last...
Irish (?) Pub,"Well... coming in to Singapore on Sunday late night that was the best option for a beer and a snack just downstairs of the hotel.
Being European I didn't really look for Irish pub but.. it did what it was supposed to do.
Nothing to complain and nothing to wow over."
Certainly Popular,"We tried to get in here on our first night but it was a Saturday night,the Rugby World Cup was on featuring Ireland so we had no chance!
Next day we were there for Sunday lunch,it was really good,prices are hard to beat in the area from what we saw,it did get really busy not surprisingly & they did try to rush us early on but we were in no hurry,by the time we wanted to leave the place was so packed & the staff so busy we struggled to get our bill & pay!
Really enjoyable"
Great atmosphere,We visited following a football match when the team my son plays for won their game. It was also the night of the Japan vs South Africa game. The place was packed and everyone was in good spirits. Will definitely recommend to others
Great Irish bar for Sports,Really great Irish bar in Singapore - perfect spot if you fancy a few beers while watching the game - rugby/premier league etc. Guinness isn‚Äôt bad either!
Sports & Beer,"Awesome Irish bar in central Singapore. Friendly staff, great selection of drinks and a good set up for sport."
Nice Place,"The food is good, especially for the price. The staff are friendly and kind. However, the inside tables are far too loud, you can't have a conversation and it's a struggle or order anything due to the volume. While the outside tables allow smoking, despite having a no smoking sign on the wall. Unfortunately, whichever seating I choose, I feel uncomfortable. If smoking were no longer permitted outside, it would be a perfect place to hangout."
Muddy's Singapore,"Good pints of Guinness and Kilkenny. All sports shown, lots of screens. Volume reduced after 10pm when the band comes on. Pricey, but if you are looking for goodish Irish fare and sports then worth a visit."
"Ok pub food, very loud band in small space","We went here as a group outing for 11 people. There was live music that was very loud, so it made for difficult conversation. The food menu is limited on Sundays. The pot roast was just ok...a bit tough. Fish and chips were fine and the shepherds pie looked good."
Great spot for lunch,Visited here with family for lunch. Food was excellent quality and good value for money. Good service and friendly staff. Declan gave us some local advice. A good all rounder.
Ice cols Guinness,"What a great place to meet friends and the expats after work great bar with great service, we visited after going to Harries bar over the road to people watch great location for it"
Beer O‚ÄôClock,Needed a beer to cool down... nothing like a nice friendly Irish bar.. staff friendly and very hospitable... beer went down well
Rubbish,"I never write bad reviews about bars and restaurants, but I will make an exception. Terrible selection of beers, ridiculous prices and the Guinness was lousy. Rude staff. Never coming here again."
Outstanding,"Exellent food and service A great Irish Pub.
With Declan as your host with his superb staff.
A great atmosphere not to be missed."
Just fabulous.,"Just had Sunday roast at Muddy Murphys. Everything was perfect, the roast beef done to perfection. Pink in the middle and very tender. And came on a piping hot plate - just the way is should be. The staff couldn‚Äôt be more helpful. Polite, smiling and welcoming. Good portion sizes and nothing more to say, except. Just Fabulous !!
I would recommend to anyone.
And the rest of the menu looks so yummy - we‚Äôll be back to sample some more very soon.
A big thank you."
Birthday celebration,"We were celebrating a 70th and 80th Birthday and found this Irish ‚òòÔ∏è pub in a great location.
We found this pub to have a great atmosphere and the food was first class so good in fact we visited three nights.
The staff were very friendly and helpful and of course the Guinness was great"
Guiness on tap,Old fashioned pub. Good for watching the rugby - its full of expats if you want. Good value and relaxed.
A rare find,"Stopped in here with some work colleagues the other evening for a few beers, nice spot and one of the few I have found where you could have a smoke while you sipped your beer,a rare find indeed"
Looking for AFL.,"Visiting Singapore and wanted to watch AFL. Muddy Murphy‚Äôs is next to the Hotel we are staying in.
Met Declan O Donnell who is their delightful Customer Service Manager. Declan certainly lived up to his title.
Gave us a very warm welcome. Set us up comfortably to watch my favourite Crows Team play and win. Better still.
We decided to eat here also.
I chose the Fish and Chips. Absolutely delicious. Great presentation. Batter was delicious as was the fish. My other half had the Irish Sausage Pie , he proclaimed it delicious. I followed up with Apple Crumble. The service was top class. Would highly recommend if you visit Singapore. It‚Äôs a very unique Irish Pub."
Nice bar,"I had a nice time here, the food and staff were very friendly. The internet was good in the area and prices were ok"
My review from last visit to this place. Ordered a wine but ended up getting it in a glass with lipstick on it. Not good,Bad experience. Got a wine in not so clean glass with lipstick on it. My review from last visit to this place. Ordered a wine but ended up getting it in a glass with lipstick on it. Not a good experience. Better they take note of this and live upto standards.
Had to go there,"Did have a meal there one night, it was very good the atmosphere was good, thy had the English football on so the male members of my family enjoyed that. The staff were very friendly & helpfull."
Quite good,"Service quite good. Nice ambience. Also I have to write 100 characters. I am required to say more, but actually I would prefer to stop now."
A Little Gem!!!,"I Really loved this place!!The food...
Wow!!!...Delicious!!!!!
A great little find!!!
Great Ambiance, Good food and drinks and really nice staff...So friendly!!!
I will certainly be back again!!!"
You‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre in Ireland!,"Popped in on a warm day of walking and shopping for a cold drink and to catch some Rugby! This is a great find and totally unique . The staff is friendly and fun , you‚Äôll love the atmosphere and the food too! They have live music as well but we didnt get to see that, next time for sure!!!!"
Muddy Murphy‚Äôs,"Spot on bar just off Orchard Road.

Great service, tasty food and a good mix of customers.

Sunday‚Äôs can be a mad house with the local band kicking off at 16:30 then it‚Äôs onto premier league football.
Seating can be difficult to find due to a full house.

Average happy hour prices, decent selection of beers.

Well worth a visit."
Beer&Beef,"Had a rather late dinner there, just before closing kitchen - due to poor weather that day.
But could sit outside, protected from rain.
Beer excellent! Grill of the Day great! What does a man need else before sleeping!
(Some nasty guys might enter Orchard Tower across the road...)"
Brioche bun?,"Good Irish pub, top local beer and obviously Guiness. Authentic ambience.food looks good but has its faults. Brioche bun with mushroom soup??? Really? Crusty bread, soda bread, wholemeal bread, or just bread, definately not brioche, wrong on every level. Good for football though, I mean premiership. Open for footy late or early. Try a breakfast but insist on salted butter for your toast, they give you unsalted, whats all that about? Sri, the waitress great, she takes good care of you."
great pub for drinking and watching football,Fabulous atmosphere with bands playing and many screens for premier league football. Had a great night there.
Moved location but still a great place for the Craic.,"The bar has moved 100 meters up the road since I last visited but still has a great feel both inside and out. Good bar menu. Spent the evening watching sport on a multitude of large screens. Good bar service. Only downside, toilets are in the adjoining mall, not the end of the world although did not see wheelchair access (it may be there and I just missed it)."
Cosy pub to chill with good food & drinks at affordable prices,"I give this place 4 stars cos Have been here few times after work as it is a nice place to chill and have a draught beer....they have Good selection of bar foods to try.... my fav is their lamb stew..... good lamb to flavour to it...

Had their bacon butty recently and it was decent...the bread is thick and a bit sweet and have a slight cake like texture....my favourite bacon sandwich is from St John‚Äôs Wine & Bakery In London....they use toasted crispy sourdough bread that isn‚Äôt to thick with slices of meaty back bacon which is the way bacon should be (Hate burn to a crisp streaky bacon) with brown sauce at the side... sound simply but taste heavenly"
Kitchen done at 9.15 pm,"The kitchen at that place closes/last order at 9.15pm. After a long day at work, you won‚Äôt need to go there if you are hungry. They have only bar snacks from then. Not what one would expect from a proper Irish Pub. Dismissed."
Small roast and expensive beer,"This was recommended to me as an authentic Irish pub. The setting and the atmosphere are fantastic, really meeting the expectation. The food and drink, however, were not quite so up to scratch.
The quality of the food was good (not great but the roast beef was nicely done) however, the portion size was scanty; I'd expect twice as much in the UK as a minimum and I've definitely been served roasts four times the size. I expect a roast to be filling and I left hungry.
There were two beers on tap, neither of which is particularly special and certainly not up to Irish standards or worth paying $9 per half pint."
Lunch every day,"Back again staying at the Orchard Hotel, and still find it impossible to avoid Muddy's, which is part of the complex. Staff still happy and efficient. New food menu"
"Good place by the water to watch sport, have a drink, and a great pizza!","Went for a drink and to watch the All Blacks test. Lots of screens, good atmosphere with fans, and the pizza was about the best I have had in a long time. One large was big enough as a meal for two. If you want somewhere a little quieter, there is outside seating where you can see the water. Service was friendly, attentive, but not intrusive. A really good choice, all in all."
Incredible experience,"This little gem of a bar is situated behind the hotel we stayed in. Found by a recommendation from a friend of a friend .
The first thing I noticed was the cleanliness of the place . The atmosphere was warm and friendly. This seems to be a ‚Äú go to place for sports fans and where local people meet . . I can‚Äôt vouch for the food as we never ate there but after seeing how packed it was for Sunday lunch it was today, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs pretty darn good .
I have to emphasise how great the staff were . Thank you so much to Joanne. Conductor of the orchestra , Minh, always smiling and working . Jacquline with her great sense of customer service .
This bar has stood out amongst many bars my wife Jayne and I have frequented along our travels . I feel you will not be disappointed.
So long guys
Brian,Jayne Tony and Julie"
Great lunch Set,I love their lunch set. The chicken cutlet was so tender and very filling. Portion is really worth it. Usually would take away as my office is near their location. My colleague and i enjoyed the meal. Thanks
"Lively large pub, shame about the singer","The new Muddy's, above the old location, is a large pub, with lots of screens and a good range of beers, standard Singapore prices, i.e. expensive, but that's the city and not much you can do about it. There's a lot of wood in the pub giving it a homely atmosphere and it's a good place to watch sport. I was watching a live EFL game and the band was playing. Good Irish stuff with a little punky feel as well to it, which was enjoyable. Then the singer started and the event became more of a self love fest. A pity as it means i'll avoid the pub at music time as I don't want to hear that again!"
A pint of Kilkenny or Guiness,"In all, Muddy Murphy's is a great place to meet friends and have a wonderful time. There is a spacious outdoor deck/patio if you wish to get away from the din indside the pub. They have an extensive food menu as well to satisfy your Western food culture however this establishment seemed to be a bit understaffed therefore it takes a bit of time for your beer to arrive to your table.
It' worth the visit if one is overwhelmed by their Asian travels."
Irish welcome,"For a slice of Ireland in Singapore we visited Muddy Murphy's. Staff friendly and food delicious - we sampled the mushroom soup, fish and chips, chicken tikka masala and beef burger. Prices reasonable with lunch deals and happy hour offers available. Would recommend and will return."
Muddy Murphys,Second night in Singapore and the family took me to this bustling Irish themed pub. Nice atmosphere and very good food. Friendly attentive staff.
Good AFL GF atmosphere,"We had lunch and drinks to watch the AFL Grand Final here. The staff were really accommodating even though we hadn‚Äôt booked.

Good pub fare and there was a lot of interesting food on the menu.

Heaps of screens to watch the action and live music at half time made it a great place to enjoy the game."
Piping hot Sunday roast,"A very well known and popular pub, especially with local expats. Sunday lunch was excellent and served fresh and hot."
"Great Beer Selection , Atmosphere and Food","This is a real Irish bar imported from Ireland which has great service and lots of TVs showing football , rugby etc.. All the food we tried was very good. You can also sit outside on the patio and watch the wildlife go by."
What a Roast!!!,"After living in Singapore for a few months, we really fancied a good roast dinner. Muddy Murphy‚Äôs was recommended by a friend and it didn‚Äôt disappoint! The roast was incredible! The beef perfectly cooked, melted in your mouth and the veggies were crunchy. Followed by the Blueberry pie - truly delicious! And reasonably priced!"
Nice bar but food and service very poor,Its quite on the pricey side and choice of menu was pretty good. We waited a good 30 minutes after ordering and then my husbands meal came out. Mine came when he had finished his meal. The portion sizes were absolutely tiny - my husband joked he was going to Macdonalds afterwards! The staff were nice and very apologetic and took my meal off the bill. It won't be somewhere we will choose to visit again. Very disappointing.
Great place with a very friendly atmosphere,Nice place to hang out with friends or good colleagues. Service is fast and they have a selective number of dishes. This is okay for a nice and relaxing time.
More soup than guinness in beef pie,"Had the worst guinness and beef pie last night. An anaemic soup, cannot have been any guinness. With carrots, celery and 6 tough chunks of beef. Worst ever and in an Irish pub too, shame!!!"
Friendly atmosphere and great service,The staff and the atmosphere are so great here. Several evenings they have bands and they are really good. I would highly recommend this place and wish to thank the staff for their friendship!
Another visit,"Still highly rated as a preferred eatery for us. The staff are never seen to rest, even the boss, Declan, is always on the move. Food continues to be at a very high standard, prices reasonable and if you happen to be a KrisFlyer member there is a 10% discount.
If you visit, say ""Hi"" to Jay (you can't miss her!!"
Great pub,"Great pub in Singapore, very friendly staff, good food and with wonderful atmosphere, always returning here."
Typical Irish Pub,It is pretty much your typical Irish pub. Just happens to be in Singapore. The sandwiches are excellent and the beer is cold. Trivia nights are lots of fun and they do often have live music. Can get crowded but the staff manages that well
A fun neighborhood Irish pub,"As American expats living nearby, this is one of our favorite neighborhood places to eat and enjoy a pint. There are many TVs with soccer on so attracts spots enthusiasts from around the world. It is a great place to watch current World Cup games. The bar menu has an outstanding veggie quesadilla. And they have a great selection of beers on tap."
An enjoyable afternoon,"Very friendly staff and good variety of beers on tap. We were in the pub for an early dinner so getting a table was OK, although it did become busy later on which was great for the atmosphere but not so good for the late diners. The food was was both generous and enjoyable as well as being well cooked. Good location, ambience and a great time."
Good place -Try it out,We came here twice in a week. Good place and goo location. The place is pretty busy. Service is fast and waitresses are nice. Food was really tasty and beer n cider were good. Definitely recommend trying it out.
A Traditional Pub,"Don't usually seek out Irish bars on my travels as they can be a bit pretentious-but glad I made an exception here.
Good food and great staff that live up to all that an Irish pub should be.
A very mixed group of people come here from expats to tourists - all who help make the pup what it is.
Been there several times while in Singapore for a couple of months during Feb and March- popped by the place again while back in Singapore this week to say hello to some super nice people.
I will be back next time I am in Singapore as it has great music, good food and the friendliest of staff."
Horrible service,"This place was linked to our hotel and we wanted a drink and some food after a long day in Singapore. It was our first time in Singapore and we had been blown away by the service we have received. Sadly it didn‚Äôt continue here. Our waitress on a Sunday night was rude and disinterested. We both had beer (no more expensive than anywhere else in Singapore but still not cheap). I asked for wings to be told they had run out. My fianc√© asked for chicken bites and when they arrived, they were wings! Food was ok but wouldn‚Äôt come back just purely based on service."
Irish Pub in Singapore,"A very traditional Irish Pub in Singapore. Amazing band on Saturday night! The food is really good! Try the lamb shank, felt off the bone! Nothing more to say except, will be back! Cheers!"
Yummy roast dinner,As an expat... This is the nicest and most reasonably priced Sunday lunch. Our weekend there was the choice of either beef or pork. You can choose just the main or with a starter or pudding or both.... Highly recommended....
Great venue for football and drinking,Nice place to go watch football with a few friends and have a drink as well. Cozy environment and multiple screens for football viewing.
I Love This Bar and I'm sad to Say Bye for Now,"Thank you Declan and your fantastic team for great friendship, entertainment and food. I'm sad to leave Singapore but I'll be back next year and see you all again then. Ken."
Pub,Dropped in on a Saturday evening. Lots of expat crowd for the games and drinks. Prices at the bar was reasonable. Half pint for $9! Told by the waitress the shepherd pie and the Guinness pot roast was out of stock! Had their fish and chips and beef burger. The fish and chips was generous although taste was a little disappointing. The beef burger was good and juicy. Ambience is pub style. Lots of people watching the screen for Soccer from England. Reasonable prices all round!
Sports bar.,"We were staying close by and looking for some where to watch the AFL.
Meals were nice and reasonably priced and the Sunday afternoon saw a band playing some good covers.
After initial ordering of food and drinks there was no initiative taken by wait staff for drinks but more an observation than a complaint."
Nice food,"We visited twice. Nice atmosphere, pleasant service and good food. Prices are also reasonable. Recommended."
St Patrick‚Äôs Day,What a great pub the staff are super friendly and attentive even when very busy. Had a couple of nice meals great cocktails. It‚Äôs always good to celebrate your birthday on this day. and a fantastic band the paddy man. Thanks for a great couple of visits. Would recommend this place to everyone.
Worth dropping in.,"My wife and I arrived at the Pan Pacific Orchard after coming off a cruise. We decided to explore the surrounding area and saw Muddy Murphy just around the corner from the hotel.
After a long and hot tour of the local shops we decided, as we are on room basis at the hotel, to pop in and have a drink, cold Bulmers and a pint of Kilkenny, which went down a treat and something to eat. I settled on fish and chips and my wife had shepherds pie. Could not find any fault in the food or service.
Been in twice since but haven't eaten. Sunday was an oyster and Guinness boat race and the place was packed and today we had already eaten in the city centre.
The staff have always been welcoming, attentive and friendly."
Friendly,First bar we visited after a long flight and gagging for a pint. Had to wait for it to open at 11:00 am but well worth it. Nice friendly atmosphere and made welcome. Right next to the hotel so handy. Go during happy hours as anywhere else here as the prices can be prohibitive.
Irish of sorts,"No Irish staff, but the Guinness is cold, and the Irish whiskey flows easy. Always some good tunes on, creating a lively atmosphere"
"Not the same, but still a great hangout","Has the feel and look of almost every pub that appears in Singapore these days, which is a shame as i preferred the feel of the original set up - before the re-opening at Orchard Hotel

However, the staff are still the hardworking and friendly lot - run off their feet a bit during the Eng v Wales Six Nations night as it took almost half an hour for our drinks to arrive

Still, the pub I‚Äôm most likely to drink at when I‚Äôm in town"
Great pub,Amazing irish pub. Great atmosphere and variety of food and waiters come around to take your order. Everyone friendly. Its located in the bottom of the Orchard Hotel area just off Claymore road as well. Can't fault it. Great music to sing-a-long to if you want.
Good food great beer,This pub is located a short 10 minute walk from Orchard MRT and just off Orchard Rd. Muddy Murphy's show all the major Sports on big screens and also host live bands. The menu is reasonably priced but if you want the Guinness Pie order early as they do run out. A pint of Guinness costs about $13 and go down very well in the humidity. Muddy Murphy's was busy on the occasions I visited with ex pats and would recommend a stop here for a bite to eat and a pint. Staff were attentative and I didn't have long to wait for another beer.
Expensive pub with atmosphere,"Walked up to the pub from Newton‚Äôs food centre. It took about 20-30 minutes. Got there about 11pm. No tables available so shared seats with another few people around the outside keg table. Outside was for smokers so that was the first problem.
Music was fairly loud, so had to shout at our friends.
Drinks were pricey about S$14-20. Drinks nothing special. Bar food acceptable and priced according to the expensive expectations.
When we left about 1230am it was still very busy.
Interesting place to visit but just like any other Irish pub and expensive. However, everything in Singapore is expensive these days. No more bargains."
An Irish Pub that Delivers,"Staying at The orchard and looking for an eating outlet I stumbled on Muddy Murphy's. I am so glad I did. I ate over three days at different times. It became THE Eating place for me. Enjoyed the pints, the Sunday Roast, the steak and Fish & chips. Some say it is pricey but I found it worth it. Muddy met my nee my needs and satisfaction was the end result. I will be back the next time I am in Singapore."
Consistent,Have been coming here at the various incarnations since it opened. Bacon butty and a couple of pints - always delivers.
A Pub That Changes Character With The Time Of Day,"Been going for years, back to when Muddys had the underground pit. Its a bit awkward now (access wise) at the higher level however more than compensated by the excellent pub grub menu, the brilliantly friendly staff, an unexpectedly good Sunday afternoon blues band, and bloody sports - just enough screens and not everything is AFL! This is not a blokes pub but family friendly, I see families bringing in their toddlers and having a nice Sunday roast or an afternoon lunch when the pub isn't so busy. Past 6.30pm and the geezers come in swearing and talking football, oil & gas, and whatever .. but its a pub for goodness sake and I like it.
Just be aware if you have youngsters - as with any pub - after 6pm there is a more adult character. Standout item on the menu is the all day Irish breakfast which is truly magnificent and can give the Sunday roast a run for its money. Well done Muddy's. Do I get a free pint for this review ?"
Great atmosphere,"We always choose this place because of strategic location and great ambiance.
Live band is great and the service was okay.
Food was good too and normally their set lunch was inviting!
It was always our choice for lunch and normally if we were lazy to travel, we would have our drinks after work. Great place to chill with friends"
"Good beer, Service is ok","Guiness beer is great, I didn¬¥t expect anything else..
Service quality could be better though.

Still recommended for having a drink"
As Good As Ever,"I like the new Muddy Murphys and think its as good as ever or even better. The staff are warm friendly and always make me feel welcome. The food is excellent and its the best place in Singapore to watch sport.

My favourite visiting time is Sunday afternoon around 16:30 when the band strikes up and I relax and listen to a fantastic selection of well played tunes.

Dont miss this place when you visit Singapore!"
Interesting plsve,"Nice little bar with football on, drinks reasonable priced and excellent food. Was some interesting clientele"
Ok,"It is a sports bar, respectively pub in Singapore - that says it all. Drinks are, like in most places, fairly pricey. Staff is friendly and has a good sense of humor"
Good Irish pub,This is a good Irish pub located inside the Orchard Hotel. Food and drinks are very good although the drinks are much more expensive than in the UK but this is what we found in other bars as well so it is not an isolated incident.
"Good food, great service, good beers!",Thoroughly enjoyable simple food well presented and served in a very friendly manner at reasonable prices - nothing to complain about whatsoever and plenty to enjoy!
A good Irish pub,"Called in yesterday for a cleansing ale or 2 in this very nice pub. Can't say enough about the staff especially Jay who helped us with every enquiry we had and was so pleasant, she is a credit to herself and her employer. Thanks Jay for all your help

Australia Nov 17"
A nice place to have a pint or two of Guinness.,Loud noisy and boistrous bar with multiple TVs to catch up on major sports. There is outdoor seating too for people who like to have a drink and smoke
Just Don't,"Rated well, but really disappointed. Soup was insipid, fries a mess. Service indifferent. Yes, there are beers. Also, right in the midst of one of Singapore's zones to find women of the night."
