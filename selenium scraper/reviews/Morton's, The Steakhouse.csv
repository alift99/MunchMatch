Steaks and more,"The menu is the same around the world. First the onion bread. We usually order the tuna tower and crab cake starters. Then the christopher chicken and either a steak or fish

Only the lobster bisque in the taipei branch is good

Usually no room for desserts as the portions are quite large

Service pretty good but depending which branch you go"
"Great Steaks, Great Wine","Our go to for steaks in Singapore. We love the rib-eye, scallops starters, mushroom and spinach side, the bread and cheesecake. The wine selection is great but of course, at restaurant prices. We discovered an amazing bottle of Pinot Noir, Eternally Silenced here. We usually receive good service here but post covid, the whole world is short staffed including Morton’s. Nevertheless, very happy with our meal and the service this particular day in Dec 2022."
Fantastic service,"Shanks @Mortons made our experience exceptional. His service was attentive, but not intrusive and he anticipated our needs, Excellent service from Shanks - he is a credit to the Morton's brand. The whole team were amazing and the food was delicious, 100% would come again."
"Great food, excellent service","Went there for a birthday celebration. Apart from the usual personalised menu, a hard copy of a photo and complimentary dessert, I'm pretty pleased by the attention given and the warm welcome we received. They team are always on a look out and serve the food at the correct timing. Nonethless, food was good though we overestimated ourselves and order a tad too much. Overall a really good experience."
Food is good but…,The table of 4 just beside us are drinking and talking loudly. And it’s throughout my whole session. Doesn’t made my day especially my special day with my partner
"Great food, service otherwise.","I was there on 24/7 to celebrate my birthday. Morton’s always my number one choice every year because the food is great, service is great and atmosphere is perfect. But this year, it leads us to some disappointment with the service rendered to us. When we arrived, the female staff dedicated to us led us to our table and while I was there early with my boy, she made a comment of “you can sit anywhere since ya you are the first one here.” After which, she just chucked the 2 thick booklets of wine menu onto my hand and left. There’s no place on the table for me to leave the booklets, so my question was, am I suppose to hold on to them? Next, when we were all seated, she came immediately and said “so you want your group photo now? Since you are here for your birthday.” I responded and said we just sat down and haven’t even order our meals. Moreover, with my yearly experience, the staff will only take photos for us when we were served our birthday cake. She went on to say “you have to let us know when.” I was left in a bit of shock as I thought it was pretty rude of her. Fast forward, after our meal and when they brought in my cake, 1 of our friends was away at the restroom, so I mentioned to her that I will only take a photo when he returned. When my friend returned, she was nowhere to be find and another staff actually helped us took photos using our own mobile phones. Halfway thru, she appeared, looked on and walked away. We didn’t bother much since we were not hard up for the printed photo. However, when we finished up the cake, she just came over and said “so are you ready for your photo now?” I told her it is ok since we already finished our dessert and her colleague had already helped us earlier on. Her response was “you are the one who said you wanted to wait for your friend to come back. So now do you want or not?” After which, she hastily took a picture of us, printed it out and chucked it to us.

I am very disappointed with the kind of attitude that this staff portray. Totally unprofessional and totally not with what I had experienced yearly with Morton’s. She is basically telling me that she just wants to get her job done and that’s about it.

No doubt that food is great, but service wise, I can’t comment. Will I come back again? I will for the food, but if I am to be treated by this kind of staff again, maybe I will not."
Terribly Disappointing,"Been to Morton's many times in the past but this was the worst experience ever. The prices have gone up significantly, which is understandable but to follow with a significant drop in quality was disappointing, to put it mildly. The chef cannot even get the grilling degree right. My guests ordered medium rare. What the got was medium. My wife and I ordered medium, we got steaks that were almost well done. When I decided to send my steak back what I got was medium rare. At such a high end steakhouse you would expect the chef to be able to get this right. Getting zero out of four right is pathetic. Some of the steaks did not even look like they were 16 oz steaks as stated in the menu but significantly smaller even after taking into account shrinkage after cooking. Won't be returning in a long time unless they change the chef. At their price point there are better alternatives. The whole place was also way too dimly lit. This is a restaurant not a bar. It would be nice to be able to see more clearly what we were eating."
Awesome Food & Service,"Celebrated a birthday at Morton's Steakhouse. The soup, the steak, the sides dishes and dessert were all so so good. They took and print a family photo for us, birthday greetings on the menu and even a special birthday soufflé desert. Everyone working there were so friendly and nice. The whole dining experience and ambience is fantastic! Food is a little pricey but the whole dining experience make it worthwhile!

** my food photos are not so well taken as the restaurant is romantically dimmed."
Above excellent!,"One of the finest fine dining steakhouses I have been to. The food, amazing service and ambience were above our expectations. Good for special occasions - the staff and food certainly made our visit memorable."
Steaks and more,"A big group of us shared starters - oysters, crab cakes, tuna tacos. All good. My main of USDA wagyu was good, but not wagyu according to my japanese colleague next to me. Ok grand marnier souffle. Good service"
Good Food,"Went to Morton Steakhouse numerals time. Good food, service wise - nothing extraordinary. All in all, a satisfying dinner with my family."
Great dining experience,Good service and many choices of wine. Interesting selection of seafood and obviously the prime steaks is great.
Absolutely awful,Shut at 8.58pm. Pathetic. How the hell can a restaurant of any quality shut before 9pm. Must be because no one was eating there before we got there. Front office staff basically shrugged there shoulders and were not interested in our business.
Awesome experience as always.,"Celebrated 18th wedding anniversary with the Mrs and kids. Portions, recommendations of meat and sides were spot on, food was delicious as always. Was last here 9 years ago but the quality, ambience, service remains top notch!"
Anniversary dinner,"The food is generally very good. The only thing is that the 3 scallops (pretty small in size) costed $45/-. Seems a little pricey, though it is well cooked."
Great Food with Great Service,"What stood out was the excellent service by their staffs especially Shank and Jaren. They were friendly yet professional, attentive and full of initiatives by suggesting services that catered specifically to our needs. Was blown away by the specialised service for my family. Made our anniversary a very good experience for us all. You have great staffs at Morton’s! Will definitely be back."
"Lovely food, Service could be better","Morton’s, our favourite restaurant for special occasions! We’d always dine here for my birthday, anniversary and year end festive celebrations. The food never disappoints, consistently good and the hot chocolate cake is the best lava cake in Singapore!

Sadly, when we dined during this X’mas, service was unlike before…perhaps because of the 1.5hr dining timeslot, it felt rushed when the plates were cleared the second we finished our food. And when I asked the staff the difference between the 2 salmon on the menu vs the seasonal special, he couldnt share and mentioned “this Ora King salmon”. But both are! He went to the kitchen to check but came back with the wrong info again, claiming the one on the usual menu is bluer blanc"
Fantastic personalized birthday celebration,"Celebrated my son's 19th birthday at Morton's. Called to check if they can arrange to have a cake. But it was too last minute and unable to accommodate the request. They asked for his name. When we got to dinner, they printed his name on the menu, sprinkled stars and birthday graffiti on the table. And gave him a soufflé with a candle after dinner. Fantastic service with a personal touch !
The crab cake is a must to try. It's moist and with lots of crab meat pieces, unlike other places that tend to give you dried out little bit of seafood tasting starchy lump. Our favorite ribeye is always done to perfection. If you are a small eater, share the steak, so that you can also share the sides."
Comparison with taipei branch,"We lived in taipei and went to their morton’s like 20 times, so it’s fun to compare

We had 4 starters - grilled oysters, tuna tower, crab cake and lobster bisque. All on par except the soup. The singapore one is more watery, less robust and no brandy

We had 2 mains - chicken chrisopher and scallop/lobster. The chicken was dry and tough. Do not order the $120 scallop/lobster dish. There are 4 small scallops and 3 crumbs of lobster

They did waive the chicken bill though

7/10"
Morton,"Not impressed with food. It used to be good. Crab cake at $45 is just one small piece, good for 2 at most. But wat was disappointing was the steak. Ordered medium rare but came medium! This is really a No No for a steakhouse with reputation!! And server actually tot we ordered medium when we showed her the steak until she consulted her order sheet. Not like it was packed w patrons that day! Morton is definitely struck off our list of steak place. She asked if we wanted it replaced. We declined as we dont really want to waste food as this piece would definitely be thrown away!"
Bdae Celeb at Morton’s Steakhouse,"Had a wonderful anniversary dinner celebration with hubby at Morton’s Steakhouse. Staff went the extra mile to provide a nice cake and photo taking. Also, the table was nicely decorated with some flower petals! We ordered the center cut mignon filet and USDA ribeye steak, with crab cakes and au gratin potato to share. Food is excellent with the steak cooked to our preferred doneness, crab cake and potato is flavorful with a nice texture. Price is high but guess it is expected for a well established steakhouse. Only drawback is that perhaps due to the current COVID constraints, towards the end of our meal reaching dessert time, we felt kinda rushed as the staff mentioned we only have about 15 minutes left and dessert will be served even though we are not done with our main course yet. Nonetheless, we finished our meal in good time."
Great steak and service,Had a splendid birthday celebration. Service was exceptional. The oyster and steak were delicious as well
One of the great steak house to try out!,This is my second visit back to Morton. Love it that the staffs here are attentive and always give great recommendations on what to order. The freshly bake bread roll is amazingly big even for two person. Soft and fluffy that goes beautifully with the butter. Simply adore the onion soup here as it is one of my favourite menu item. Tried the cajun ribeye this round which is well seasoned and to my liking. Sides nothing fanciful though. Will definitely be back again.
Unforgettable experience.,"Service, Food, Wine, one word, EXCELLENT. Servers were very friendly and were the cherry on top for the overall experience. food portions are huge so do come with an empty stomach and loose clothing."
Our nth time back to Morton,"Had wanted to go Morton early July for wedding anniversary celeb (we go almost yearly), but due to my eldest son loves to go Morton, so had to change it to my husband's bday (in July too). This time brought along my twins who are big enough to enjoy the food and fun. Glad to be able to go before the HA Phase 2 started on 19 July (2 pax dine in till 22 July).

Steak according to my husband is still as great. I shared the king crab legs & mac 'n' cheese with my kids, and i must say the king crab legs are very very sweet and delicious, mac 'n' cheese is same old same old.

Ordered the lava molten cake as was told restaurant gave Souffle as complimentary for bday celebration. Souffle was still as good though we never been a fan of souffle. But the lava cake wasn't 'lava-ed' at all, and it was tad hard inside, just like brownie, but inside is harder. I thought this was changed, or I ordered the wrong dessert. Checked with the waiter who went to check with the kitchen, and got back to apologize on the molten cake, gave me as a complimentary as well. This was quite disappointing on the molten cake, as I really wanted to let my kids try it since they all love chocolate.

Overall service might have dropped a little, I think it was understaffed? as the restaurant was still quite crowded.

Hope everyone stay safe and thanks for everything."
Love how dim this steakhouse is!,Food and service was good. But most of all I love how dim it is like a real steakhouse. Our table of 5 dressed up but we were really disappointed the restaurant allowed guests in shorts.
Delicious seafood and steak,"The prawns, scallop and cajun ribeye steak were amazing. The truffle fries and mac and cheese were average for the cost. I would still visit again for the mains.

We appreciate the extra effort in making my sister's bday wonderful. Thank you so much!!

Recommendations: if a table places an add on later, please just serve after. Instead of serving it together with the original orders. Otherwise, the important mains (steak) will be cold. Appreciate you all accepting my feedback and serving my mains first."
Great food and service,"Amazing food and service, brought out all the stops for a special occasion including a photo and print out highly recommend"
Lack of Mortons personal touch.,"I went Mortons with my husband and two sons.

We got the 7pm seating. When we walked in to the restaurant, there were barely 5 tables were seated. Yet everything was so slow. The simplest things like passing us the food menu taking our drinks order took quite sometime.
When we want to place our order, no one attended to us.
Everyone was just standing around and chit chatting. We raised our hands few times to get someone's attention.
We got a server's attention but just to tell us to wait for the server in charge of our table to come.
Every staffs there at Morton's are so calculative!
Never experienced this at any other restaurant's.
Our server were always seems to be busy and missing.
My sons mocktails arrived after our main course served.
Again Waved our hands again(we hate to do this but we left with no choice) to asked for some mustard and ketchup as our fries was served without it.
We told a server that we needed some ketchup and mustard, instead of getting us the mustard we can see the message been passed around from one person to another. Its really frustrating to see it.
And finally we didn't get it at all.
We been to Morton's many times. The Morton's experience always the best, this time its the worst!
I can see almost everyone are new. Maybe they don't know what is Morton's guests service supposed to be.
I enjoyed the food but when the service is bad. I feel its not worth the price.
To the lady server that served us. We were there about two hours, but we barely see you or interacted with you.
Sad, definitely not Morton's style.

Morton's you really need to improve and level up your game! Morton's you used to be favorite restaurant to many of us now, if this continue you'll definitely going to lose many of your regular and new guest."
Not as good anymore,"We have been to Morton on many occasions which usually pretty good but unfortunately, it was not the case last night. The reason why we picked Morton is because it’s a special occasion so we don’t mind to pay the higher price to hope we have a good time but the experience was a little disappointing.

It is lack of sincerity and presentation.

The women who took us to our table & took our picture gave me the impression of lack of sincerity & just took our picture just because she have to as a job. She basically on a fast speed, snapped & go.... I’ve watched her did the same to the other guest too.

One couple came in with their mask, sat down & they don’t even have a chance to remove their masks yet & she took their picture & left....

The presentation of the food is lacking. It is more like we serve at home rather than a restaurant.

Our Lyonnaise potatoes was over cooked & almost burnt.

The soufflé can taste the grainy sugar.

The positive was the freshly baked bread which was the only highlight of the night.

The steak was cooked okay."
Morton's Downhill Slide,"I have been to Morton's many times since the 80's, both in the US and in Singapore. All three children of mine celebrated their 21st birthdays at Morton's.

I visited Morton's on February 22nd 2021 to celebrate my 64th birthday but the S$155 piece of porterhouse steak was slathered with what I thought was salty soy sauce. When I asked, I was told that ""beef broth"" has been poured over it and ""that's the way it is done at Morton's."" I couldn't finish the steak and ask for what was left to be packed for my dog.

No apologies whatever and piteous, feeble attempt at damage control. ""We can remove the sauce and re-grill it,"" was the offer. I declined.

Definitely not how steaks were done at Morton's in the past.

And definitely my last visit."
Morons...Mortician,"Sooo BAD..
Wow...such an underwhelming evening, poor food..like really bad, potatoes that are floating in cheese..poor atmosphere... margharita served in a wine glass...honestly AMATEUR NIGHT.
And shocking price.. honestly disgraceful. Never going back to the Mandarin... BAD"
Always amazing service,Very accommodating in a way that is not intimidating unlike other restaurants who always keeps an eye on you that’s not so comfortable
Disappointing for a restaurant,"Disappointing for a restaurant that I loved in Chicago. Overpriced, sommelier doesn’t know wine properly and can’t give recommendations.
Steak was ok, starter (cocktail shrimp) was average..
it was ok, but not to standard for the price and location.
Service was friendly but again, nothing special.
Shame, I was excited to be back at Morton’s"
Not memorable cuisine,"The lighting was too dim for my comfort. Service was friendly and good but food was not up to expectation. The Sea bass was dry, tasted muddy and difficult to eat despite the cream sauce. The steak for the grill platter was overdone. The Lobster Bisque was smothered with too much cream. The Ahi Tower and French fries with truffles and the melted chocolate cake was appreciated though."
Steak was lukewarm,"The restaurant is beautiful and has a very good wine list. We came for the steaks. The cut was good quality, but it came lukewarm for my medium cooked steak. So when I tried to put the truffle butter over, it didn't melt the way it should. Had creamed cauliflower, nothing special. And also we didn't quite get the toppings for the baked potato - a bit cold by then. Tried the creme brûlée which tasted nice, but a tad lumpy. Worse of all, I went home and puked it all out. I don't know what happened, and which were the items that were off. Suspecting the lumpy creme brûlée.

Will I go back there? I don't think so. Many other better restaurants than this."
Really tough steak ☹,"I had high hopes for mortons given its brand, but sadly our steak was really tough, not worth the S$150 per pc price tag. Not sure if theres difficulty in sourcing for beef during covid but it was really bad. We didnt send it back becaus we dont usually complain as to not make the situation awkward but sadly we wont go back. Wooloomooloo at Swissotel and 665f at Andaz have far more superior steaks that are really juicy and tasty and of course, Cut by Wolfgang Puck is always a favorite."
Losing its fine dining touch,"Has been many years since we last visited Morton’s and wanted to relive some memories. However, despite the much appreciated prices, the fine dining experience is not the same and not worthy of the price. Service is attentive and steaks are still cooked to perfection. But expected more for ambience and thoughtful touches from a Michelin restaurant. While it’s always been dim, they used to bring a light to help diners read better. Instead, the servers just brought a menu with bigger font. Despite well spaced tables, the place is to noisy for a good dinner conversation. Server did not highlight the additional sauces and individual sides that we could have ordered to complement our steaks or did they caution on the size of the steaks and suggest ordering 2 or the porterhouse to share between our family of 4. The free dessert was the soufflé but was expecting a choice of flavors rather than the standard lemon. The restaurant did not even provide a holder for our masks which some restaurants that charge a fraction of the price provides since masks are compulsory now and is more hygienic being kept away during dining. Overall, expected more, not worth the price. What happened to fine dining in Singapore?"
Forgot our anniversary,"Upon reservation, staff asked if we’re celebrating any special occasion, so I said we are celebrating our 3year anniversary with my husband. However, there was nothing, seems they forgot about it completely. The food was good but too overpriced. They were charging Michelin star price. Atmosphere was too dark, could barely read the menu. Overall, I will not come back."
Always a Favourite,"Morton's always comes up as a family favorite for special occasions. It was definitely still up to the standards as we have tried on many occasions for over past 20 years. There is something about the dim lit steak house that makes one enjoy the meal, drinks and ambience. Oysters were very refreshing as starters as was the iceberg lettuce with blue cheese and truffle fries were crisps and delicious. The beef selection were cooked to perfection and everyone enjoyed. Nice finishing touches with complimentary dessert, limencello and a nice memorable photo of the outing. Edwin and staff took good care of us! While on the pricey side, Morton's is worth it on special occasions."
Love it,"Family affair of 4, we ordered porterhouse, and 2 side dishes (asparagus, and the bacon mac&cheese); when our food came i noticed there were 3 side dishes placed on the table. Apparently our server took the liberty of making us fries; no biggie we took it in and paid at the end with no fuss. Overall we enjoyed our meal."
Memorable wedding anniversary dinner,"Cosy booth seats, personalized menus and souvenir photographs of the night, great steak and wine, friendly servers that give you the right amount of space/privacy, was an enjoyable night celebrating our 2 year wedding anniversary here."
Birthday Celebration,"birthday celebration for my partner. name printer on the menu and surprise photo section. Food and service is excellent, but price is bit too high and the environment is too dark."
Wedding anniversary Dinner,"We choose the dinner set .Steak ( beef) was excellent! The place was not crowded and the restaurant has ensured that social distancing has been followed.The restaurant has also prepared a special treat for us.Indeed ,we had an awesome celebration!"
Excellent birthday celebration,"I've never been disappointed with a visit to Morton's. From start to finish, service was great & staff made me glad of my 50th birthday celebration venue. Cajun ribeye & lobster are all the mains you need. I wouldn't bother with the other cuts of steak as the Cajun ribeye is the best! Desserts were a great ending to the evening. We were well satisfied. Only negative...the dim lighting."
Great for special occasions.,"My go-to place for superb USDA prime cuts grilled to perfection and also for celebrating special occasions. Only issue was the dim environment, would prefer more lighting. Staff were attentive and friendly. Average cost 200/pax with wine."
Decent cuisine but dropping standard,"Been here a few times to celebrate my wife's birthday. They used to have to die for free orion bread, splendidly cooked ribeye steak and wonderful complimentary chocolate lava cake. Now the Orion bread is harder in texture and the complimentary dessert soffle is the only option.

Service wise could be better, lacking the usual interaction, clarity and knowledge of the menu for recommendations"
Celebrated my birthday here,"My bf brought me here to celebrate my birthday. Excellent service, awesome steak, classy dimly-lit ambience! I love it so much. They printed a menu with my name on it for me to keep as souvenir. A free photo was taken, made into a card with all the staff’s signatures. That’s a very thoughtful gesture. Staff were well-trained in explaining the menu. We always order medium rare steaks and they cooked it just the way we wanted. It’s not the easiest doneness to achieve but they perfected it. Shrimp cocktail was very delicious too. We like the food very much. Pricey but worth it. Keep up the good work!"
Nice steak and great service,"Visited for dinner here to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
Was surprised with the additional touches they made for us. Firstly, they printed a copy of the menu with our names and congratulations on our wedding anniversary. We brought home a copy! Secondly, they took a photo of us made it into a card with all their signatures and well wishes. Thirdly, they prepared a complimentary dessert for us.
First time having such an experience during our anniversary celebration at a restaurant, and it was pleasant!
The ambience and setting were nice. We enjoyed the corner given to us which was quite private.
The food was good and portion was big. So we were glad that we decided to share instead. We ordered the crabcake, lobster bisque and Prime ribeye steak. They all tasted great and not too salty as well.
Thanks for making our dining experience a great one!"
Another 5 star performance,"Morton's Steakhouse has never failed to deliver 5 stars satisfaction for my visits, time n again.
Foods with great presentation n taste for our Set lunch n aka carte orders.
We love the enhanced option n ordered starters of grilled oysters n shrimp cocktails. Lobster bisque n 5 onion soup also tasted good. Esp the latter which is not salty served by other restaurants.
Grilled king salmon, fillet mignon steaks, truffle wagyu all delivered well n enjoyed by all. So was the grilled prawn n scallop crocheted.
Signature Mortons chocolate cake never fail to amaze us. Cheesecake with caramelized top resembling creme brulee very much to very liking n taste. Complimentary souffle also tok Kong

Prices not cheap but expect quality ingredients n portion.
Our server Zen deserves 5 star too. Friendly, very knowledgeable n professional - few can challenge her for impeccable service. Keep up the service with a big smile."
great steaks,Went there for our last night in Singapore and were not disappointed. The service was great and the steaks cooked to perfection. We enjoyed the classy and elegant atmosphere. Be prepared for a high bill however.
Great Martini during happy hour,I dined before many years ago but this time I come for the happy hour bar that last till 7pm. The 50% off martini is my favorite and continue the old charm with steak sandwiches to be tasted for free. Love the ambience and great choice of the Martini cocktails . My favourite one lady’s the lychee martini !
Lost it’s original shine,"It’s been a long while since I dined at the Singapore restaurant. A visit at Morton’s always carried an air of classical vintage but with sophistication. Sad to say that has been lost since the take over by Landry’s.

First, the familiar Frank Sinatra’s crooning is gone. The color of the light colored booths, chairs and uniform have been exchanged with dark colours. And the live presentation is no more. Now the brand has lost its shine. It’s just another super expensive steakhouse.

Saving grace is that they kept the traditional martini’s happy hour that continue to serve its steak sandwiches. And the quality of the food is still there. But it’s really no longer the same Morton’s. That connection with the brand is sadly gone."
USA Steak At It’s Best With A1 Service,"Wow. Where can I even begin. Dining alone on business and what I can only describe as a huge loaf of bread was delivered to the table warm with perfect temp butter. This could have fed a family but there were no complaints from me. Beautiful. Next up we’re half a dozen of the finest oysters accompanied by every condiment one could dream of which included a spectacular champagne drizzle sauce, classic Tabasco, Horseradish and another which escapes me- amazing. For the main I had no choice but to follow my love for ribeye with the 22Oz bone in ribeye, the sides were for sharing but the staff were kind enough to arrange a special solution for me where I could choose two as I was dining alone, sautéd mushrooms and the truffle fries, subtle and tasty without detracting from the main event. And what an event it was! Perfectly cooked medium rare and accompanied with a cognac Au Poivre sauce. This really was that good that I’m sat outside the restaurant writing this review, bravo to all the staff, my compliments to the chefs and thank you for the complimentary drink back, it was my pleasure to taste such divine food in this beautiful setting.

I’ll be back. You should too. Don’t miss this one!!!!"
Most enjoyable visit of all,"My husband proposed to me 17 years ago at Morton's. Now we added 2 more in our family to celebrate our wedding anniversary yearly. Great improvement in your Chicken Christopher and to die for lava cake. Loving the friendly Malay lady behind the counter, very accommodating to my requirements. Thanx"
Standard and good taste,The restaurant is located inside Mandarin hotel. Environment is quite nice and the service is good. Taste is quite standard Morton quality.
Nice experience,"Very nice athmosphere and service. The qualitiy of food is outstanding but too expensive. 2 Steaks, 1 fries, 1 bottle of wine (Australian Malbec), 2 espressi ... SGD 520.- ..."
Best Rib Eye Steak,Personally my favorite restaurant for Rib Eye Steak compared to other equivalent stake restaurants in city.
Wonderful,Wow incredible service beautiful interiors lovely atmosphere and super attentive staff.. menu simple naturally steakhouse style however food perfect quality and quantity very good.. You won’t be disappointed lovely on all levels
Good wedding anniversary dinner,The service was good with a personal photo and menu to commemorate my 29th Wedding Anniversary. Also a complementary soufflé... the restaurant made a memorable experience
Magnificent Mortinis still at Morton's Bar,"I hadn't been here for around 5 years but always feast at the Mortons restaurant whenever I crave steaks in Singapore.

Firstly let's be clear, I'm talking about the circular bar which you access via a staircase from the hotel lift lobby. (I've never understood why Mortons have another bar inside its restaurant doors.)

Any way the surging crowds seem to have died down and we surprisingly at 5.30pm we're able to get a cocktail table. ( there used to be queues leading up the staircase once upon a time)

This is a perfect, grown up and sophisticated gem where they serve the most divine Cosmopolitans! The Apple Mortini also good and refreshing. Whilst it's free mini steak sandwiches are the siren for many people, there's also a snacks menu. We also ordered the steak trio, a wonderful medley with black pepper and cheese toppings.

Bill with 3 cocktails , 1 beer and 1 snack was around S$140. Well worth it if you want quality steak but don't feel hungry enough to sit down to a full meal. We will be back !"
Best Steakhouse experience,"Have been coming to Morton's for the past 3 years to celebrate any anniversary or birthdays as they provide such good service.
The steaks are also Huge and delicious.
You can order 1 large portion to share and top up with sides, appez, and soups. Don't forget desserts!"
Great Dinner at Morton's,"Went to Morton's to celebrate a special event. Food, Service and Ambiance were fantastic!! This is an annual event and will continue as such. Had drinks in the bar before dinner and watched"
Birthday celebration,Wife Ordered the rib eye. It was great quality and portion could serve 2 person. I had the New York medallion. Meat was tender but over charred on the surface.
Fantastic Service,"Went to celebrate birthday of my girlfriend on a Saturday night at Morton's Singapore as we are fans, we love the one in Hong Kong but had a very disappointing visit to the one in the IFC Shanghai so fingers were crossed as to what this one would bring, being in the Mandarin Oriental we hoped for the best and they didn't disappoint.
From the time we entered the service was very warm and seamless. Unlike most restaurants that just bring a cake and sing a happy birthday song at the end of dinner, this restaurant from the time we entered to the time we left everyone wished her a happy birthday which touched her; even the menu was personalized with a Happy Birthday greeting on it sitting on the table before we sat down making for a great start. Morton's is not the place if watching your budget but the food and service were well worth it and we left with great memory of the restaurant albeit with a lighter wallet."
Best steaks and great wine,Prime cuts deserve the name. The staff is Subash excellent and can recommend the best suited wines. A place to be visited who likes steaks and wines.
Like Dining in a Dungeon,"I had good experience at Mortons Steakhouse in Hong Kong and Taipei so thought I will try the Singapore establishment as well, which is situation at Mandarin Oriental.

On arrival, the first thing I notice was it's very very dark. I can barely see and the sun haven't even set yet. I was assigned a nice sofa table but again, the lighting is appalling. It's so dark that I couldn't even read the menu and the waiter helpfully provided a torchlight otherwise it will be impossible to read the menu. I supposed they wanted to make the atmosphere romantic with this dim lighting but they got the opposite effect instead, which is to make the restaurant feels like a horror movie set. Also, I don't think the few couples and families dining in the restaurant appreciate the near total darkness.

The food was good. I ordered a lobster bisque and a rib eye steak. The steak was very well cooked, just the right temperature, with a crunchy outer crust and juicy and well marbled, typical of excellent steakhouse. The price however is expensive and in my memory, more than the other Mortons restaurant. So there isn't much value for money here. Service was fine, nothing outstanding.

The atmosphere of this restaurant is just too dark. They can do better by installing more lighting. Right now, it's like dining in a dungeon. Creepy and dark. I will give this place a miss next time. Pity, the steak is actually good."
Excellent,"First time here. Came here for dinner to celebrate a Friend birthday. Impeccable service from the front door to the wait staffs.. Server for our table were Jini. And I have to say that she’s attentive. She gave great service. Steak was huge, could be shared with your buddy.. It was nicely done as per ordered. Food was delicious. Great service. Great vibe. Great ambiance. The foods. The place and service justified the high price that we paid for. Highly recommended. Would definitely come here again."
Excellent place to chill!,Went here several times just to chill. They have happy hours at 5 to 7PM with superb sandwich definitely must try! Their martinis are the best.
excellent food with Amazing service staff-Ken,"Had an amazing dinner here last night. Food was so delish- we shared a huge, scrumptious, melt-in-your-mouth marbled and flavourful USDA ribeye(glad we shared or else they may have to wheel me out in a wheelchair;-)
The appetiser was freaking good too- the jumbo lump crabcake was a treat to my palate.
The mushroom and fully loaded potato hash browns left such a tantalising palatial memory that I woke up craving for those and wishing that I should have asked them to bag the leftovers.
The main highlight though was our server - Mr Ken or Kendrick(I'm so bad with names)- we were sitting at the corner table and Ken was such an excellent server, he went above and beyond his duty by ensuring that we were comfy. Somehow he knew the exact time to appear, and disappear in such a good timing manner that my partner and me could enjoy our food and also had our private banters/conversation. Ken also took the initiatives to find out where in Singapore we could head to after dinner for that cigar my partner craved. Top notch hospitality service!"
Excellent food but let down by service,"We selected Morton’s for an important milestone birthday for our father in law. Nice little touches such as a customized title on the dinner menu (stating happy birthday to him). Also a nice individual soufflé presented following the meal as well as a commemorative photograph. This was appreciated.

Unfortunately the service, whilst pleasant and efficient when around, was far too inconsistent and slow for a restaurant of this stature and a meal of this value. From the time of seating 7:00pm, until the first appetizer, it was 8:10! Often the server was no where to be found and during the entire meal only checked in with us once other than the actual plated services. We had to ask for someone to her her for us to order. We had to request for her to have the plates cleared. We had to request 3 times for the bill (and it took 15 minutes to generate and pay that for some reason).

We enjoyed the porterhouse for 2, bone-in ribeye (very good), mostly every side dish, salmon, one pasta dish and some appetizers and dessert."
Much Sought-After Steakhouse,"Heard so much about Morton’s and finally made it there. Although the beef fillet was not as succulent as I would have liked, everything else was perfect. The seared sea scallops with caviar butter simply melts in the mouth and the herbed crusted lamb chop with orzo was just perfect! The half lobster was also delicious. All went very well with Caymus red wine!"
good quality steaks,Huge portions. Good quality steaks. may be helpful to share cuts if party has smaller children. Cream corn was excellent
Birthday celebration,"Server's were not attentive. I requeted for a window table but was not granted. Hence, we were given the wrong bill."
Romantic Night Out,"The first US Steakhouse to come to Singapore still dishes up top quality nosh. Pricey but the portions are enormous so a couple can easily share a appetizer, main, side & dessert and still be stuff. Service remains impeccable!"
Great service at bar during happy hour,"visited morton’s bar for their famed happy hour, martinis were potent and great, sliders came every half an hour - definitely good.

best of all , the mostached staff by the entrance saw my 22 week pregnant (she’s not drinking) wife sitting on the high chair and offered a plump cushion for her back. what a nice gesture ! kudos"
pricey but must try,"Love their huge bread and steak! Sides comes in huge portion but so so, can skip. comes with great service and customized menu."
Satisfaction guarantee,"Pleasant dining, everyone was good there, didn’t manage to get the staff name. One female lady (short hair) and a Indian guy.. friendly approach by them, would come again!"
Great place for drinks,"Was there on a week day evening for drinks with work team mates to celebrate the completion of several major projects. We got a table for 6 of us and the place was getting crowdes as happy hour started at 5pm to 7pm. We got our drinks and ordered some food from the menu. But the best thing is the sliced beef steak buns that was served on the house to guest. It was juicy and tender and warm. Really nice bites. The place had tables well spaced out, adequately lit and the service was friendly and non intrusive. We did not recall any piped music and we just talked, joked, drank and ate, without being disturbed by the surroundings and neither were we disturbing others with our chatter.
Nice place and experience. Will be back again soon. Cheers!"
Bar was great when open,"Enjoyed drinks with friends on the one occasion it was actually open.
Nice bar location in the hotel But always seems to close early and you are told SO.
They missed a great opportunity on a Friday evening with a larger (15+) conference group.

Can only assume they very little to do with the Mandarin Oriental hotel except being on property as the welcome and experience was very different ."
Exquisite,"Had a birthday dinner in late June. The service is excellent and the food is marvellous. The Lobster Thermidor came with Mac and Lobster side dish and it was simply delicious. The Prime NY Steak flight has 3 pieces of small steak medallion (4oz ea). There is wagyu, prime US and I coudn't remember the 3rd one. Nice to try 3 different small chunks at one go. Simply exquisite!"
Nice ambiance. Food is nothing special really.,"Maybe it is just me but I really do find the steak served in Morton's to be nothing special. Probably your usual American food in a more lush setting, slightly more refined cooking methods and possibly a big dent in your wallet."
Not worth your penny,"For a “reputable” steak house, the USDA porterhouse cut was tasteless (as if it got rinsed through some water) and the beef short rib was so dry. The only saving dish was seafood on the contrary.

And we thought their “signature lava choc cake” will be something to look forward to...yup disgustingly with an extra ingredient - ant on our dessert plate!

Even after taking the dessert & terrible short rib dishes out of our bill, it still came to $500+ which I honestly believe should have spent elsewhere decent for nice meal or steak.

Service level was subpar and no manager came to apologise for terrible & unhygienic ending for us to celebrate father’s day. Our first and last - Morton’s overrated & not worth your penny."
NICE DINNER,"We are there for birthday celebration, when we settled down the staff come and take photo for us and later they pass us the photo with the menu printed with ""Happy Birthday 24 May 2019"" and at the end there is a birthday cake on our table, thanks!
Foods is nice too... really enjoy our dinner!"
Below expectations,Below expectations compared to other Morton’s. Very expensive for the quality of the food and service you get there.
Great,"I can sum this restaurant up in one word, great!
One of the best steaks I’ve ever had, ordered the filet and scampi and shrimp dinner and it was great.
The bread they serve was great, I also ordered a shrimp cocktail which was excellent.
I believe this was their first restaurant in Asia. The general manager was outstanding and the entire staff was excellent.
Had the Mixed berries for desert which was also excellent down to the last blueberry!"
WOW,"Great food, good service and wonderful location make this one of my favorite restaurants of all time"
Very disappointing,"Let’s be factual:
- average meat quality (or far lower quality that what you will get at Cut steakhouse for the same high price)
- bland side dishes (creamy spinach had no flavor except fatty cream)
- below average service (inefficient or disorganized: 4 waiters targeting the same table) while not being attentive but rushing around

We love steakhouse but when we pay so much we expect what we get at Cut steakhouse in Singapore today: perfection!

Last time for we will visit Morton except for the cheap happy hour at the bar at 5pm which remain good value for money.... otherwise, run away unless you wanna burn your money. Can get far better in Singapore nowadays!"
Good Food,Good Food... Good Atmosphere... everything is good. Service is tip top. Will revisit again at next occasion.
Wonderful meat,"Come back again and again at Morton's. Always a great experience. Wonderful meat and good service. The wine was great, too"
Easter at Morton’s,"Three of us I enjoyed: filets, lobidter in sauce, and a pork chop. Desserts we enjoyed were chocolate layer cake, carrot cake, and key lime pie. Service was attentive and food was outstanding. We loved it and will return."
Mom’s Birthday Dinner,"“Great” would be an understatement on how the Food and Service were. The Atmosphere is good however could be improved by increasing the brightness of the lights as it was a little difficult to even read the menu. Overall, a great experience."
50th Birthday,"Started off with 2 martinis in e bar ,good measure of vodka aprox 2.5 shots aprox 75ml. It packed a punch and took the edge of the day.They serve really yummy mini steak sandwich foc.
After our drink we went to the restaurant .
We ordered the ribeye bone in ....Lamb chops....layonaise potatos,mushrooms and brusel sprouts. The steak was very good and lamb was cooked perfect nice and pink. We washed it down with a glass of wine each.
The only thing that was not in my oppinion to my satisfaction was the lighting at the table. I could hardly see my food . I was a bit disappointed.We finished off the meal wuth a soufle which was on the house.
This is the interesting part we payed with cr/cd the bill was $500 exactly.
The following morning i went to get my cr cd but could not find it so assumed i left it at the restaurant. I called them that morning and asked them to check at my table to see if they can find it. They assured me they would call me and let me know .
They never contact me or call to say if they found the card.Very disappointed in the customer service. After they take ur money the dont care. Food was nice ,waiter service attentive, ambience nice but too dark.
I would think again before going to the restaurant."
A Real Treat,great food and ambiance. need to exercise caution when ordering as portion is huge! The steak has the great chargrill aroma.
Excellence as Always,"Just had a business trip to Singapore and as usual - had to go to Morton’s for their steaks!

I haven’t been and was again, not disappointed in this trip!

Tasted a lot of steaks in various countries but Morton tops!

Try their Key Lime Pie for dessert- it’s also good and kinda cleanses the palate!"
Birthday,"Late post of my birthday dinner at Morton
Thanks for my wife who found a new place for my beef craving. The steak definitely come at a very big portion but I wouldn't say that the quality of the meat justify the high cost but the ambience and service is great. My wife definitely like the fish and the sides.

Beef and more,"Consistent food from the US. The steaks are the mainstay but we usually have the chicken and fish which are good too. Of the appetisers, the tuna tower is good and lobster bisque (with lots of brandy) is excellent. Onion bread good too"
Dinner,"High end steak house. Didn’t disappoint. Waitress knows the menu very well and is able to provide good recommendation. The food was very well done and the size of the servings are just nice, including desserts. Bill for 4 person including a bottle of wine comes up to around $200/- per pax, which is within expectation. Will certainly come again."
Awesome,Service is fantastic and the food is really good. definitely worth the money. Ambiance is very lightly lit. a good setup for couples.
Awesome steak,Had a great visit/steak at Morton's this week. Service was incredible along with the food. Best steak in a long time.
