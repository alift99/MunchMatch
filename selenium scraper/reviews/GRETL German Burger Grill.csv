Horrible service,"Horrible service. Not waiters fault but owner who doesnt employ enough personnel.My burguer order got mixed up so had to wait for my plate whiel family was eating. Had to ask for coffee and tea three times after meal finished. Had dirty plates in our table for nearly 30 minutes. Not even apologized when I finally complained. Food is only reasonable. Given the bad service , Avoid the restaurant."
visit to gretl!,"i enjoyed my experience there. i’ve been there before too on multiple occasions with my family and i thoroughly enjoyed my time there all the times i’ve been there. the food as usual was great! value for money. piece of advice for anyone planning to visit any time soon, try the orange sauce with the fries they are the best thing ever !"
"Delicious food, delicious beer","Located just down the road from some of the big Orchard Road malls, this place is relatively easy to find. We had the Rabauke burger, chicken sausages and beer that I can't remember the name of, but when we ordered it was the first option that came up with the burger. The beer was quite sweet which I'm not used to, but it was delicious - as was the food. The restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere and the staff were great."
Very good,We have been there after a few months. It is much better than in the past. It was alwyas good but now staff seems to be more active and professional. Burgers are always very good. We love it.
Do not visit,"For the prices the quality of burger was not worthwhile. We ordered the sausages and it was much smaller portion as compared to their menu picture. Taste of fries were mediocre at best. The burger patty was dry. The waiter whom seated us was rude and unhelpful. The ambience was horrible, small tight places and a noisy environment. Will definitely not return."
Value for money burger meal,"I was surprise how generous on the option for a set meal. it comes with not one but 2 drinks. from the choice of bread to the sides, you may need sometime to decide to make up a set. friendly staff. recommend to reserve your seat. there is a better ambience inside the"
Burgers awful. Fries good. Beer cold. Prices RIDICULOUS.,"Burgers awful. Fries good. Beer cold. Prices RIDICULOUS.

That’s a very solid review, take to the bank. If you’re looking for a good burger, you’ll not find it here. We wondered if they’re even cooked on site, as there is no questioning how you want it prepped."
Excellent customer service and attention,"We stopped here for one quick cocktail on our last night in Singapore. I ordered a Negroni. When it came, it didn’t taste right. My husband took it back and asked if it could be remade. The chap came and spoke with me, and I explained it didn’t taste right, too much gin, not enough vermouth. He added vermouth and brought it back. It was worse!! But, he tried and I thanked him for his kindness. Five minutes later he returned with a brand new drink, much better tasting, at no extra charge, despite that I had drunk some of the original drink. He was so keen to ensure my experience was good, and I was very grateful for this. I didn’t get his name, but hopefully his team will know who he is. Thank you!"
Don’t bother,Don’t bother Overpriced burgers where everything is an extra. A stark contrast to the value for money and atmosphere in the parent chain in Germany
Wonderful experience,Delicious burgers! Superb beer. Excellent vibe and ambience. I felt like I was transported to Germany / Austria for a bit. They had various options for vegetarians. I highly recommend this place!!!
Not too bad,"Hhmm food was not too bad but… overpriced. Got my drink order mixed up-I’ve ordered an Original Coke(I specifically asked for original, she could have told me if there’s no original coke I could have order a different beverage) but I got a Diet Coke.

Nothing fantastic lunch experience, just so so"
Too much sauce and cheap meat,"We were quite excited to go to a German burger place. Sounds unusual, but knowing that Germans like good food, we expected a lot more. Meat paddies were worse than McDonald, sweet cheap burger buns and wayyyyy too much sauce"
Simply Dont Bother,"One star purely because i cant leave zero stars.

The menu ordering system is extremely hard to navigate, not intuitive and often resets without warning. Even when the staff tried to assist, it remained a challenge. The staff explained their point of sale does not permit order taking directly with the staff and must use the online portal. More crashes and eventually we end up making individual orders for a table of 8, repeating the process a number of times for missing items.

Despite all this we still ended up with a single bill that we had to split, so why bother with all the hassle and separate online ordering.

The food was below par. Average ingredients are used in the meat patty's. It's more reminiscent of the cheap microwave meat served in frozen burgers. While we appreciate the German's are not exactly renowned for burgers, the prices should at least command a minimal expectation, yes some how they still 'cheaped' out.

Back to the bill, we were able to order some tap water from the staff, but found this had been added to the bill in the end for S$1 per small glass of tepid tap water. Firstly, charging for tap water, secondly, how can that be added to the bill if the staff cant enter manually?

The Beer was Cold and Wet, so maybe that's worth a star, but good luck placing an order for it.

Don't bother, and certainly don't go if you are hungry - once you are successful in ordering, you will wait..... which should take no more that 2 mins to microwave a burger, but they manage somehow."
Great beers and burgers - vegan options need updating,Great vegan options but burger isn’t the tastiest - better vegan burgers out there now. Beer very good price on happy hour (think 5-9pm) @ S$8.50 a pint. Good atmosphere to have meal and drinks with friends
Excellent for vegan lovers in Singapore,Excellent vegan burger. Paradise for vegan lovers. Patty in burger was crisp and staff suggested very good option. Will come again
Good selection of food and drinks,Great place to hang out with your friends on a Friday night. Love the food and beer selection there.
Nice location.,Nice place and very good service. Burgers could be a little bit juicer. Meals are great for kids and parent.
Love burger? Come here..,Come here during lunch time where I found this convenient place to dine. Enjoyable food with lots of focus on burger and salad. Choices of beef and chicken burgers with few selection of add on like mushroom or eggs. Ordered a local flavour sambal chicken cutlet burger and a happy hour beer ! Quite worth for beer at $8.50 than water. Served water but at $1 per cup. The service is great and lovely ambience with indoor and outdoor sitting.
Best burger in town,"Tried a lot of other burger places in town, but I always come back to this place. I'm a big eater and find a set meal satisfactory with the tasty burgers with meat and non-meat options, served by friendly and helpful staff in a nice atmosphere."
Great for social,Very value for money to be able to order a set meal that includes a pint with an additional fee. Downside was the menu system that was not able to track the drinks order. But great service made up for it.
Best burgers in singapore!,"Love the food and service! Polite staff and amongst the few places with a large variety of vegetarian and vegan burger choices, and most (at least ones I’ve tried) taste delicious!"
Great food!,"The burgers were nice and juicy, though a bit on the large and pricier side. We got the banana beer, which was good as well (I'm not a beer drinker, so I guess that says a lot). The sun shone into our seat after a while, which made it super bright, but otherwise, the experience was great. Staff was also friendly, and when we had difficulty with the app during our food-ordering, they were happy to help us without making us feel we were troubling them."
Great family experience,"My son loves burgers, so I brought him to Hans Im Gluck for a treat. He had the Wilder Western burger and was blown away by the taste. The pretzel bun was an excellent touch to the burger. For myself, I enjoyed the Kase and Speck selection with the sweet potato fries. My wife was also thrilled with the tastiness of her Kasebor vegetarian burger. Overall, the family had a great time. The servers were friendly and the ambience was delightful."
Burgers and Beers,Like this place. All their burgers are amazing (tried chicken/veg based). Love their dragiht beer as well. Waiting for my next visit.
Poor burgers for a burger joint,"We went as a family of 5 in December 2021. Surroundings were OK, but to pay $1 for a single glass of water (no top-ups, but apparently the money goes to charity), is unnecessary.

So we sat in our masks, hot, huddled over 2 phones, trying to navigate the overly complicated menu. Ultimately the choice seemed to be either a burger or a 'set', which came with an array of options and add-ons. For us to order, it must have taken 20 mins!

Sadly, the beef burgers were thin, hard and over cooked. The chicken burger was the same. There was nothing succulent about these burgers and for a place that serves just burgers, that's not good. Perhaps the other outlets are better, but we won't go back and I wouldn't recommend it."
Experience at Hans Im Gluck,"Reservation was smooth and it didn’t take long for us to get a seat. However, I found that the staffs were relatively unprofessional in handling their customers from their gestures, attire (in FBT shorts and home T shirt) and it took quite a while for the food to be served.

Would prefer going to the VivoCity outlet"
Burger on Christmas Eve,The Food is amazing and the service. Starting from the App to order to delivery time everything is precise and efficient. We spend quite some time and it was memorable.
Awesome and Fantabulous Food,"Food was amazing and we Loved it. To be precise Food, Ambience, service, courtesy was all fantabulous.
The only down side was the delay in serving the food. Out of the couple of hours I was at the restaurant with my family, we waited close to over an hour for the food to be served.
Staffs were very courteous and provided great service. Will definitely recommend to my friends and will visit again soon."
Awsome food,Food was great and service was excellent. Will definitely go there again to have burger and beer. Enjoy
Great!,Great food and service as always. Waiters are accomodating and friendly. The place is perfect for gatherings
Excellent Food,"Lovely atmosphere, great selection of burgers and they all come fully customizable. The process of ordering online was simple and staff were friendly and efficient. Pretty good value, too. The chicken wings were awesome. Great tasting beers in a variety of sizes, which was great."
Disappointing service (or lack of…). All we wanted was a beer.,"To be fair, I honestly cannot rate the service, because basically we didn’t get any.

We had just gotten through a day of Black Friday Christmas shopping on Orchard Road and were really keen to have a nice glass of beer (or two..) to relax.

Arriving at the front, we were asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. Choosing inside had them decide to bring us to the “back”. After a short walk to what didn’t even feel like the same restaurant anymore, we were seated in a separated area with one other set of patrons, and some staff taking their breaks…one was even sleeping (disappointment #1).

We were then greeted with a staff member placing condiments in our table and pointing us to a QR code, where we would see the menu and could place our order. This is the was the last time we’d be interacting with any staff (disappointment #2…while I appreciate the efficiency, that didn’t seem to improve our experience in this case…)

After watching the other set of patrons leave, us being the only customers in the room (there were more staff either resting or chilling behind the bar…). I was seeing no one doing anything to fulfill our order. All we wanted was a cold beer, and I saw the taps where I assumed the beers were to be poured from were not in action at all. (Disappointment #3)

After some time, should have been at least 20 minutes now, we watch 3 other sets of patrons enter the room, being extended the same greeting of placing condiments on their tables. All this being done by one person, and the rest of the staff busy NOT pouring our beers! (Disappointment #4)

Being somewhat annoyed, but still wanting to give benefit of doubt, we called a staff member to validate if he had my order. We watched him walk to the register, as if to refresh the screen where my order should be, to him then coming back to me to say “2 beers, right”?, although my order was for 4 beers (happy hour 2 for 1) between the 2 of us. I didn’t disagree as at that point, all we wanted as a beer. He gave a thumbs up and that was the last we heard of him (disappointment #5)

We then spent the last 15 minutes watching them bring the other patrons, who arrived after us, get their orders, which were more elaborate than ours. (Disappointment #6)

Needless to say, we’ll never patronise, or recommend this establishment to our friends. All we wanted was a beer (or 2)."
love the burgers,we keep coming back! super love the burgers and the sauces! The atmosphere is good and service is fast!
Uncomfortable,The food is good and so is the service. The only minus is that the seats are tied to the tables. Someone who is a little bigger and if anyone has back discomfort will have some difficulty to move and sit comfortably. It is actually not a brilliant idea they have come up with.
Nice ambience & delicious food,"Nice cozy place & the staff are attentive, polite & nice. Tried the chicken burger this time as i have been ordering the beef burgers previously. The chicken burger taste as good as the beef burgers, juicy meat & burgers are soft."
Lunch at Orchard Hans Im Gluck,Very lovely and pleasant experience. Friendly and helpful staff. Had a lovely birthday surprise of waffles and ice cream!
"Dinner at HANS IM GLUCK on Saturday night, 2nd Oct",I had dinner there with a friend and we noticed that the service was very helpful and the staffs would check in to ask if everything was well. We also really enjoyed the food. It was only my second time there but I am looking forward to having meals there in the future. The vibe of the place is really beautiful too!
Highly Recommended,"I always have a lovely experience each time I dine-in at Hans im Glück. The service is on point, aside from the consistent delish flavour of their burgers and thick fries. Indeed, I cannot wait to dine-in again."
"The place is nice, drinks overpriced","Bit pricey for drinks, and menu would not scan. I’m more inclined to enjoy a real menu Vs having to squint looking at my phone. Perhaps they should invest in tablets."
Food,I paid additional for a sunny side up egg with my naked burger . Unfortunately the egg was completely fried.
Good quality burgers at a decent price,"First time dining at this place. Decided to do so on the last night before no dining in kicks in for the next 1 month.

The burgers at this place are good. The german beers running at one-for-one at $22 are also good deals.

That said, my recommendation is to go for the meal. At a mere $20 plus, you get a burger, a side, a large drink and a hot drink. You can upgrade the drink to a beer with a small top up in price. You can also keep the hot drink for another visit. Definitely worth it. Will be looking forward for dining in to be available before visiting again."
"Overall was quite good, worth to try!","We ordered the set meal that comes with sweet potato fries (taste very nice, not too oily), and 2 drinks! (able to choose cold and hot). The fried chicken wing marinate was so good, it was so crispy, not too oily also. Their signature beef burger was actually quite good and juicy however, the bread was quite hard and dry which wasn't worth to top up $1, should have try the sourdough instead. Overall, it is worth to go! Just expect to have more damage in your wallet as the price is higher than cafe's."
Never Disappoints!,"I’ve only been to Hans Im Gluck twice in two years and have experienced excellent and attentive service both times.

On top of good service, it appears that the food quality is also consistently delicious. My favourite part is how organised the menu is in differentiating vegan/vegetarian/meat items, and how wide the selection is even for the vegan menu — which can be hard to achieve even for a pure veggie place!

What’s more — it is also value for money with the set meal. I definitely see myself hanging out here more with friends who have different dietary needs."
Great place,Nice environment amidst the bustling Orchard road. Food and service was great too! Nice and quiet place for a cozy dinner
"Chicken was overcooked , dry, hard to cut at the edge.","Server wanted to clear plate before we were done eating. And that was only maybe 3 or 4 tables in that section of the restaurant. Not that many people on a weekday at 2pm , Chicken is really disappointing, had better, more tender chicken at the restaurant. Very cold air conditioning"
Chope & HANS IM GLÜCK German Burgergrill (Orchard),"Yes, enjoyed the Chope experience and meal at HANS IM GLÜCK German Burgergrill (Orchard). Food are yummy: unique sweet potatoes fries; beef patty juicy & not overcook Excellent Service team very friendly and approachable."
Delicious burgers!,"Many choices with bread, sides, sauces and something for everyone including veggie choices. Liked that the drinks also came in big glasses. The sauces were fun and free too! The fries and sweet potato fries were memorable - crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside."
Staffs are professional and follow the disciplines,Thanks for reminding us the alcohol time and advised a short way to wait taxi when it was super heavy rain ;) The food and sauces are good. Will visit again definitely.
Dinner with colleagues,Have a farewell dinner for a colleague at Hans IM Gluck Orchard branch. Food is yummy and good variety especially was happy you have vegetarian dish. This have make it easy with options for our guest. Thanks.
"Excellent service, great food","I made my reservation with a coupon code for 2 set lunches but didn't know I had to inform the staff before making my order. I realised this mistake when making payment, and the manager and staff were really nice about it and helped me adjust the order so I could still get the discount. They didn't have to, I would have paid full price as it was my mistake, but they did and I truly appreciate it.

They also serve one of the best veggie burgers in Singapore. Will definitely be back!"
Beyond my expectation!,"Service, food, ambience and music was great. Not a thing missing. Loved the experience, will visit again soon :)"
"Great food, great ambience!",The place has a really nice spread of vegan and vegetarian burgers along with the regular meat based burgers. I ordered a vegetarian set meal and a regular vegetarian burger. The variety of sauces and their taste is pretty good too! Overall a great experience and would recommend others to try this place.
Great experience,"Had a great experience. Food was good too! Customer Service was good, all staff were friendly and forthcoming."
Great,The food is absolutely amazing. The staff truly cares about our experience. This restaurant has left the best impression. Atmosphere is chill and cool. I recommend to everyone. Highly recommended!
First Time at Hans Im Glück,"Great and reasonably priced food. Good ambience, and friendly staff. We definitely would return again!"
Good food,"Delicious beef burger. Go for the set meal, worthwhile with a side and a hot and cold drink. Nice sweet potato fries and onion rings(pricey at $10, about $1 for a ring). Cappuccino not bad too. Nice decor and friendly staff. Must try the in-house sauces."
Hans Im Gluck,"The place was nice and quite. Didn't need a reservation actually. The burgers were great, beef nice and juicy. The set meal is great for pax in multiples of 2 as it's only a top up (from ala carte) of a couple more dollars for a set of sides and two drinks."
Very good service and good food,"The waiters were well trained, helpful, patience and caring towards the customers.
Eg. Assist on customer to order the food via mobile, asked how was the food and recommended what sauces we should try for our burger and fries.
Food were good and value for money,
Just that I don’t eat chicken breast. I preferred chicken tight or drumbstick fir the burger as it tastes more juicy and not so dry."
One of the best burger in town,Second time visiting the store and this time i brought my friends with me. They totally love the burger and store ambience. Just the cold drink is a bit bland to our liking. It can be more flavourful.
Superb lunch,"The service was really top-notch, from how prompted I was greeted by my hostess, to the short waiting time from placing my order to receiving my meal. The wait staff would regularly check in to see if the meal was OK, and were super friendly with service and recommendations. The restaurant has gone down the route of digital menus, so bonus points for hygiene.
The set meal was also valid on the weekends, and I thought it was pretty good value. I upgraded my drink to a wine with a $4 top-up.
A quick word on the beverages. Here in Singapore, there seems to be a misconception that house wines are the cheap and lousy option when in fact they are meant to be an indicator of an establishment's overall quality. The perfectly chilled 2019 Riesling from Mosel they served me at Hans im Gluck was like a European summer in a glass. This proves they take serious pride in the food and drinks served to patrons.
Between the food, drinks and the service, I highly recommend this restaurant."
Dinnerlicious 😊,Burger was so delicious with big servings. Well balance fillings and sweet potato was cooked perfectly. Set-Meal has two drinks cold and hot served after meal.
Superb,"Staff was friendly and helpful, ambience was great, and most importantly, the food surpassed our expectations. Highly recommended."
Good sweet potato fries but poorly made burgers,"We had the beef and chicken burgers. The beef patty was dry and over cooked though it had melted cheese. Flavours were flat. Disappointing! The only things that were good were the sweet potato fries and the fried chicken wings were decent. The beer was also average. Disappointing experience, will not be returning."
Nice atmosphere,"The food to me was only good, not that fantastic, The atmosphere was very nice although is it beside international building"
Good food!,"Food is really good and not too expensive, however the noise level is a bit high in the enclosed area at the back"
Good tasty filling food,"We came here again for valentines day dinner plan. We had an awesome food with the set meal options . The Burgers and fillings were excellent and filling . The salads were bit blunt but manageable.
The beers were excellent and icy cold. The mocktail too was classic and pleasing.
The staff were kind enough to clear our doubts . and get our orders perfectly ..

on a lighter note . please change the seating its a bit hard to sit long."
Fun fun fun,"We had a great time during our dinner in your restaurant. Most of my friends enjoy the special beer and the burger and they want to come back again. Have a friend that taste the banana flavor are you going to have that back again? You should so that we will try that too.
Love the music, cozy ambiance and we felt that we can stay talk all day there."
Great Food and access,Nice Burgers specially the Vegetation ones... Loved the Mango fusion with Beer.... Loved it...First Vivo City and then Orchard Road... Seemless booking and an easy Sunday meal
Nice ambience,The serving of food is quite big for me. Value for money set meal. Nice ambience to hangout with friends.
Great food w/ awesome service,It was my first time visiting this restaurant but I have been planning for quite some time. Nice cozy place to enjoy the yummy foods. Service was great as well. The staffs were friendly and attentive. I’ll definitely come back again! Kudos to the staffs
"Good burgers, chill atmosphere","I chose this place for dinner as it is known for its good German burgers and its operating hours till late. I booked a slot via CHOPE and we were assigned to a table indoors. I ordered the LANDGOCKEL. I liked how the patty is well-grilled and tender, and it's easy on the appetite. Also, the meal goes well with their in-house weissbier pint. The portion is very big and filling. The prices were a little high and there were not many ala-carte options. It would be nice if the restaurant extends their menu to light or bar-bites. Overall, it is a good experience."
Good place to chill,Overall it was a great experience. The food is good and the ambience is nice to chill and relax. A hidden jem tucked at the corner of Orchard indeed!
Best Burger Place,My go to place for German burgers. Decent portion for the set meals. Good service with reasonable prices too!
Terrible service,"Service was very bad. Waited at the front enterance for a long time and no one came so walked to a side entrance and the staff told us to go back to the front entrance.
We bought a discount voucher online and informed them before ordering.

Navigating the online menu was difficult with poor scale and loading time. When we asked the waitress for help to take orders, she told us to order online without helping us insisting “it’s easy”.

When the bill came we were overcharged and the waiter argued with us when we told him we bought an online discount although we had already informed the waitress earlier and she had scanned the QR code.

Overall average burgers with poor service. There are better burgers across the road without the lousy service. Will not be going back again."
Big portion burger,"Had the grilled chicken burger set, comes with fries (can choose your side). The set includes a cold drink and hot drink. Value for money for the big portion, can share between 2 pax and still feel full."
Healthy eating,"Love the ability to customize the burger and the myriad sauces available. As people become increasingly more health conscious, I think it is a good move to include it. Also, don't think their burger patty has like 50 ingredients in it, as it taste very home-cooked. Definitely would bring people here for the experience."
Nice meal,Wentfor a Sunday lunch.The food was good.More importantly the service by Lin an ex SQ stewardess was outstanding on table 405.Great experience
Burgers for vegans,"The four of us had a very pleasant dining experience and the food was good. Because we were vegans, we were somewhat disappointed that the restaurant did not have plant milk options, like almond milk and oat milk. So we could not have cappuccino. We had to walk across to Kind Kones in Forum Galleria for cappuccino and vegan ice cream dessert"
Good service and experience,"My first visit was very pleasant. Made a reservation via Chope and was greeted politely by the staff during Safe Entry.
All the staff that we encountered were in good spirits and polite in interactions, and about 2 of them stopped by our table to check on how we found the food.

Burgers are a satisfying portion and some may like they have a tray of sauces for your free use at each table (Mayo, some kind of marmalade sauce and 2 others maybe ketchup?)

Quiet eco ambience and lunch seats filled up quite fast. A lot of expatriate diners.

It’s at the foot of International Building (Yotel) beside TCC."
Good food and ambience (Dun expect too much on service),"Vegan burger with avocado and added mushrooms is nice!

Also thumbs up for their trademark sweet potato fries.

Food served within 15-20 min upon order, hot and fast.

Tried to reorder more food for second round. Waited in vain for 20 min
Order not captured despite sending in through in app.

Asked the server for assistance, he checked and realized our earlier orders also not in system.
Starts to lost his patience in figuring what went wrong n not apologetic at all.
Poor choice of words and tone.
We are willing to share what are our previous orders but his service attitude could have been better in handling customers."
Awesome food and good service,The food were really tasty and my kids enjoyed the food and ambient. The service was awesome as the waiters were very friendly.
“Lost” (or not lost ) Chope Table,"“Lost” Chope Reservation was a regular thing for Hans Im Glück . That was what the usher told me when I arrived at the entrance on time at 7.30pm to be shown to the table I booked on Chope. (I even showed her my mobile has a call from their number to confirm the reservation; which she told me she had no record of my mobile number and she was on a break at 5pm when that number called me ?Ooh a scam call or what automated machine called me ?
Quite bizarre...Mm...

When I called my friend to ask if she had arrived ; she was already at the table. She told me it was the same usher who brought her in under my reservation at 7pm? (So the Chope reservation was not “lost” before 7pm?)

Anyway, the snacks and drinks (thirst quenchers and beer were nice.
The burger was very dry(not my ideal burger which would be juicy... )

The environment (inner area ; we were at table 204) was nice too.

1 hour later, the same usher asked us to change to a “2 persons” table as another booking for 4 persons at 9pm arrived earlier.

Mm.... We were not told we needed to clear our table in 1.5 hours.

I hope the next time we could be informed the terms and conditions of our booking in advance.

Yes, even though I had a bizarre first visit, I would not mind to come back again for the decent Beer, thirst quenchers and snacks."
Vegan friendly and helpful and friendly,Very good service and very helpful and friendly services staff . Food are very vegan friendly and tasty. Great place for vegan and non vegan .
The best Veggies burgers in Sg,"Tired of being served impossible patty / beyond meat burgers which are just replicating meat texture (which vegetarian would want to eat that stuff ! ) we discovered Hans IM Gluck a year ago and it has been our favvv since then -- widest choice of patties -- walnut patty with fig jam , spinach patty , red pepper sauce and feta cheese patty are just a few from the variety ! and if u order a naked burger they give you some generous salad to compensate for the bread ! Service is fab, smiling faces and eager greetings make it a very pleasant experience every time !"
Good food with great service,Food has always been good. Very friendly and kind staff. Special lagar available in this outlet too!
Foodies,"Friendly staff, nice foods and drinks,,plus the view too comfy. The burgers are the best beef too juicy."
Good food and good service,Good food and good service. They are attentive and welcoming. I enjoyed myself there. Will definitely visit again.
Widest range of vegan vegetarian burgers,The service is good and friendly. The food options for vegan and vegetarian burger is fantastic. Would be fun to have a tasting option for the burgers. Good German beers.
"Premium burger, surprisingly affordable","Ordered the set (via the app) which came with the burger, a side dish (I had the German salad), a beer, and a cappuccino- all for $30. Not bad at all for a premium burger restaurant at Orchard. Highly recommended."
hans gluck review,the burger set is a great mix and value for money. i love the ambience and am a regular visitor of this place
Birthday dinner,"Headed down to the outlet at Orchard, staff were very very friendly! They helped with orders because there were so much to choose from and we didn’t know what is of our tastebuds. Food was not bad, a little on the drier side but it was still acceptable. Oh also, the chope vouchers helped us to save $10 from total bill! Totally fuss-free! :)"
Great burger,"Excellent veg and vegan options! Filling, delicious and just the right size! Friendly staff and clean environment!"
Always consistently good service and food!,"It's my regular haunt on Friday evenings with my buddies. One of the few places that serves beer before 2230hrs, and continues on with other non-alcoholic drinks and food till late. The waitress even told us the story of the origins of Hans im Gluck! Do ask her when you are there!"
Okay burgers and service.,Okay burgers and service. The ambience is nice. The photos look nicer than the way the burger is served. Nice and flavorful.
Good Value German Burger joint,Attentive service; good value burger meal. Yet to try non beef burger. Would be great if place has more air con seating in SG context.
Great & Healthy restaurant,Great & wonderful restaurant. Staff are friendly and helpful. Food menu have variety healthly choice. Highly recommended
Dinner at Hans Im Gluck,There were many choices especially for vegetarians and vegans. I chose a vegetarian one which was meant to be spicy but it was barely spicy. The meal came with a side and free drink. The sweet potato fries was amazing!
"Hans is not from Hamburg, otherwise his hamburgers would be better","We were going to try the new Shake Shack at Liat Towers, but got turned off by the 30’ queue and more importantly, the fact that it was recently visited by people who were Covid19-infected.

We had to wait 5’ before being seated by a blonde Caucasian (yes!) staff member, as there was no one at the reception counter. Ordering from the digital menu is a challenge, as letters are too small for the phone and we keep getting disconnected. Once orders have come through, service is very swift. The burgers are not great, but not bad either, better than the somewhat soggy thick fries.

Would we come back? Probably not. There are better burger places in town."
dinner,we had set meal which comes with two drinks. food is good. service is not too bad. staff are friendly
Wide selection of burgers and sides. Tasty and good portion.,"You can select what type of bread you want which is great or even go naked without bun. Perfect if your not very hungry as it’s pretty filling.
The set with 2 drinks - one hot one cold- side of fries or salad, and burger of choice is $20+. Good value and large portion, good enough to share.
Service is also friendly and fast. If you want a gourmet burger, this is the right place to go. The sweet potato fries are yummy and there are many different condiments to try.
You can also order some German appetizers or full salads if you want to go healthy."
