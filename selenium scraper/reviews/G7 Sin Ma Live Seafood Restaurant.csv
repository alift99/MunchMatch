"Individually, good not great dishes. Collectively - excellent overall dining experience","Had a Private room as quite a big group. Ordered most of the seafood - Chilli Crab with Mantou, Bamboo Clam, Live Fish etc. Nothing to go ""Wow"" about but all will agree that every dish is not too bad. The Frog porridge divides opinion among the group - from very very good to excellent.

Most important of All, it pass the Test. The test being - Will you return to the Restaurant again. A resounding Yes from all."
Food is good. Service sucks due to lazy cashier who don‚Äôt know her job. Can‚Äôt even tell which table number.,"When I wanted to pay for the food, I pointed to my table which is the first table on the opposite side of the road, ( roadside) . The safety of the customer is compromised just because of her laziness.

Cashier Cindy told me to go back and look at the table number there. She said she cannot see from her post at the cashier.

I told her it‚Äôs the first table. Another staff told her it‚Äôs table 1. Yet she still ask me to go and look at the table number.
I told her since she‚Äôs a staff how come she don‚Äôt know the table number yet expect the customer to know.

Another customer came and also ask for bill, she again told that customer to go back and check the table number.
I think your cashier Cindy is plain lazy.

Another customer took the bill and told her the bill doesn‚Äôt belong to her table. Terrible service. Messed up bill and still show lousy attitude. After I checked the bill and gave her my card, she rudely crumpled up the bill into a ball and throw it down.

Don‚Äôt let your lousy attitude cashier spoil the service of all other staff."

Food Review,"Was here with my friends for CNY eve dinner. Foods are nice, especially steam fish. For those who haven't try must come!!"
G7 Frog Porridge,Food was as always excellent. Service was friendly and prices reasonable. Have been a regular for many years.
A great experience but beware of hidden costs if on a shoestring budget,"Having walked past this place a few times, my wife and I decided to go in as it smelled amazing. We knew we wanted Frog Porridge.

Upon entry, the service was excellent; the waiter advised us on what size to get and how the Frog Porridge worked - he poured us our first bowlfull to give us an idea. We loved the experience as a whole and the food was delicious.

The only downside was that there were a few hidden costs:
1. The porridge pricing wasn't clear (+S$3)
2. The whitebait and guava nibbles given to us as we sat down we weren't told had a cost (+S$6)
3. We even got charged for the wet towels (+S$1.20)
4. And, of course, service charges and taxes.

In general, don't let this put you off (I just want you to be clear if you visit) as it was delicious; if you're on a shoestring budget, be careful when ordering."
Good Food,This is my first time eating frog porridge and it‚Äôs super good. The staff are also nice and the food delivers to us immediately.

"Delicious food, fast serving","Ordered Frog Porridge, minced meat beancurb and marmite pork ribs. All are nice only thing is if you come with kids and elderly try not to order the porridge cos difficult to bite. Serving is fast. Overall pleasant experience. Only feedback is last time when we order 3+2, they used to have the option of half spicy and half non spicy. But now no more. Have to choose either one. So, end up we just order 2+1 non spicy this round."

Standard of frog leg is no longer there,"ÂÆ´‰øù Frog leg - 6/10

Hor fan -9/10

Go lor 9 or lor 19 if u want to eat frog leg . I'd rate them both 9/10 .

This place used to have very good frog leg also but for the last 6months , every visit was a disaster when u order this dish.

But other dishes is still ok, service also not bad .

But how can their signature standard drop so much . I hope the owner should look into it before more damage are done"
