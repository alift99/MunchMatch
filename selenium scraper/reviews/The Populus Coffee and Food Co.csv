A bit overpriced for the food and service,"Food is nice but not very good, and after compared the price, I would think this is not worth to go back again"
New Year Eve Dinner with Husband,Overall enjoyed the food & atmosphere. May consider to come for the brunch. Will recommend to friends & family.
Cannot appreciate the food,The seafood linguine is the worst. The price is acceptable though. The last dinner for the 2022. Very disappointed and definitely will not visit again. That’s all.
Great Dessert,"Having booking, but do not know that is dining time limitation, being asked by waitress for few times to leave as soon as possible. But dessert just asking to serve. Food overall okay, dessert is the best with butter milk waffer. Upstairs is very noisy."
Good to try once to see what it’s about but won’t go again,"The food was ok, nothing to really rave about. Prices on the high side. Service was not impressive. They are so full that we were politely asked to leave because the next reservation was coming."
Nice cafe for brunch,A nice brunch place. Had the deluxe populus scramble and big breakky. Both were delicous. Want to try the Avocado super food next time.
"Pretty chill, food's decent","Loved the Beef Ragu. Chicken rice didn't seem appetising and add-on chicken cutlet was at $5.

We were seated on level 2, aircon was too cold! Place has chill vibes, but space was rather tight and chatters were kind of loud.

Good service though, love waiters with great sense of awareness/attentiveness."
populus,"Ordered the avocado platter with added salmon.
Friend came later ordered just the avocado platter.
I got 1 piece of toast; she had two pieces. She also had beans in her platter whereas I did not.
Find that odd but the portion was just nice for me."
Cafe Date @ The Populus Coffee & Food,"I made reservation on the Saturday during brunch timing, the cafe was pretty packed at that point of time however the staffs were really polite and nice. Food was served within my expectations as well."
Wonderful place! Enjoyed thoroughly,Had a croissant with eggs and an iced white coffee. Food and drinks were great! Only small complaint is that it was very messy at the door. Think the front of house was overwhelmed!
Good food and nice place for a lunch catch up,"First time checking out this place. My friend and I had the Spanish eggs and the braised beef cheeks. Portion is big. Coffee was ok, flat white didn’t have as good a crema as I’ll like it.
Generally good place for a weekday lunch catchup on."
Great time @The Populus Coffee and Food Co,"We were there for a catch-up, and the ambience and food were delicious. We enjoyed our choice - french toast and scrambled egg. Thank you!"
A noice Gem..!,"The Populus: (Coffee & Food Co.) is nicely tucked in a corner at 146 Neil Road, traffic junction and opposite the ICON residential housing. It is part the row of shop houses and has an unassuming shopfront; whitewashed walls & a tainted glass entrance.
We came as a party of 6 and as we missed the 10 mins waiting grace window we become walk-in again.. But just a 5 mins wait for them to rearrange a longer table and we are seated. 1220 noon time and it is full-houes.
The Menus screams a spread of contemporary dishes, that surprisingly include Donbouri?! I tried the Tuscan Lamb Harissa Baked Egg while another colleague the Halibut & Leek. I also ordered the 8 oz whites (they do not offer cappuccino though..)
The food arrived together with the coffee. All plates look so Instagram-able, indeed I posted. My choice of the slow roasted Tuscan lamb comes in tender tear covered by the rich homemade tomato sauce & the soft egg white. I can taste the yoghurt and tint of fresh lime. The meal comes with a slice of ciabatta which I used to dip into the mixed gravy. The marinated lamb mut have went through hours of stewed before it reached me and tasted superb. There are bread crumbs so I think they might have toasted the bread before serving .
The coffee comes with different latte-art, of petals and even swan! But the foam begins to disintegrate, forming bubbles on the part of the beverage. Perhaps the steamed hot was too hot?! Still this is my first encounter, while being quire a coffee aficionado. Else the cuppa taste average
We had great conversations over hearty meal. While abit heavier on the budget it was an enjoyable meal. The place is comfortable and good to catch up with friends."
Positive review,"Visited the cafe on 10 September 2022 for brunch. First time i get to sit at second floor, however the place is noisy due to many customers talking at the same time. Food is pleasant but be prepared to wait for at least 30 minutes for your food to come in."
Good chill out place.,Good chill out place on a lazy Sunday. Nice food n ambience. Great service too. Recommended for all.
Amazing ambience and yummy brunch options!,We had the buckwheat pancake and truffle mushroom carbonara. I loved both the dishes but the staff suggested that sundae with waffle tastes the best.
Disappointing,Was looking forward to this but left disappointed. Second floor lacks any atmosphere it feels like an overflow room. Service was poor as food came in 5 minutes and drinks 20 minutes later. Ordered a coffee then had to ask for sugar then had to ask for a stirrer. Basic F&B.
service staff and food,"populus have been around for a long time in the sg cafe scene. this is my first time in the recent years, i revisited the cafe. the service staff got my food orders wrongly, the staff were young and inexperienced and we were fine w that. however, the food standards were terrible."
Good food and good service,Food is nice. Quantity portion is enough. Price is reasonable. Service is also good. Nice place to catch up. Only thing is chairs are quite near to each other due to area a bit small. Can hear conversation from table beside you
Brunch,"Was here for a weekend brunch, i had the buckwheat pancake and i had this in the past but i feel very filling and stuffed after eating it. My fiancee had the grain bowl which was balanced and flavourful. Staffs were friendly, overall recommended for brunch"
Bad coffee but Great food!,"My friend and i ordered oat white (full body) mine was iced and it tasted sour but my friend's one was worst, we thought the milk spoilt or something. The staff explained that the oat milk could have been the cause of it (he said usually oat milk makes the coffee taste sour) so he offered to change it to regular milk (which was helpful thanks!). I decided to stick to iced black instead and my friend had her regular white. However, the coffee still taste towards the sour side (maybe it's the coffee bean they use? fruity/ floral). Definitely not a fan of the coffee and will not go for it again.

The food on the other hand was rather good, portions are huge! I ordered the halibut and soba, the portion of the fish was very generous, love the sauce of the soba. My friend had THE POPULUS Scramble, the eggs were really nice but she wish they didn't put the scramble right on top of the croissant as it made it soggy.

And its always good to make a reservation before going down, especially weekends it definitely gonna be crowded."
Positive review,"This is my second visit to this cosy little restaurant. Thumbs up for the food and service, my family and I enjoyed ourselves very much."
Nothing to rave about,The food and coffee were so so nothing to rave about. Not to mention that we were only given 60 mins to complete our meal which I think it’s totally not enjoyable.
Disappointing,"Waiter mentioned how each visited was to be limited to 60mins due to the crowd but our plates were promptly whisked away after spending 20mins there, and we were stunned. Our dining experience ended before it even started. we felt compelled to leave. I would have appreciated if the servers could be more attentive to a table that wants sometime just to chill. Food was average at best but $70+ for 20mins is just unacceptable. Having able to have a chill conversation is the main aspects of a cafe and this place does not deliver."
Team Gathering,"Food were rather disappointing this time round. My colleagues ordered Cod fish and they commented fish rather tough. My wagyu beef of the Breakfast Champions were rather dry, rosti kind of dry too, overall not worth the price. I guess the price was mainly due to the Wagyu beef. But the beef doesnt taste wagyu at all. The Buffalo wings and truffle fries were good though. Chocolate cake nothing to wow about but carrot cake is good. Servers were like Gen Y, can tell they are not into the job, no smiles not forthcoming, wonder if they got paid or just interns. We requested to split some items on menu to two bills due to part of the cost is company paid. The guy server said we would have told them before ordering, how do we know? He insisted cannot be done as system was set up by restaurant, sounds rigid! I worked in F&B before, how difficult can this be? He was some attitude then. Will not consider revisiting or recommending more friends to patron."
Recommended Place to go,"The food is good and the portion would be just right as I am not a big eater. It is filling. However, there's a need for improvement i feel in terms of customer service. The staff on duty, male staff doesn't look to be too happy serving. It could be due to them wearing masks so their eyes especially stands out and they look not happy."
Good place for breakfast or brunch.,The food and place is really good for breakfast or brunch. Service is also fast. Coffee is also great!..........
"Good place, for a short while",Chased us away after an hour Which was a pity because its a nice place to hang. Might be my fault i missed the sign but didnt know it was there as the staff was very pushy
"Delicious Food, Excellent Service",Absolutely love the food & service. The Spiced Lamb Baked Egg is a MUST-TRY! I wish it came with two pieces of Ciabatta. :) Ending off the meal with a perfect dessert - beautiful tall chocolate soft serve with waffle. I haven't had such good waffle in a long time. Can't wait to go back to try the other dishes.
Few items are unavailable,We entered 3pm for dessert but 2 out of 3 kinds of sundae were unavailable. We were kicked out 1.5 hours later.
Ambience & Sercvice,I enjoy the ambience and service . The food selection here is good. Will come again with my wife to enjoy the coffee.
Great place to chill and have our brunch/lunch,Food is quality and tastes great! My family and I makes it a point to visit at least 2-3 times a year.
Overrated,Service is rather disappointing and it’s very crowded and noisy. Coffee is bad compared to last time
Weekly dose!,"Good food,awesome coffee and excellent service. we enjoy our dining experience and will always visit this place again."
Nice cozy cafe with few vegetarian choices,We had the pesto pasta and the shoestring fries which were good! The avocado super veggie bowl was not much to my taste. The ambience and service was really good!
Good service and delicious food!,"Was there for the 1st time with my girlfriend for Valentine's Day. Attentive staff and good service.
It is a quite a cosy place with very nice ambience. Abit chilly where we sat so a jacket or shawl would be advisable.

The deluxe version of Populus Scramble was enjoyable, tasty and appetising. The breakfast of champions was mouth watering and the rosti v crispy.

Definitely coming back to try the other dishes on the menu"
Awesome service,Went there after I was done with my blood donation. Will be good to have a reservation so as to guarantee a seat in the cafe. The waitress who served me was very helpful as well in providing me advice on my coffee choice.
Recommended!,"As we’re not big eaters, the 3 of us shared a Populus scramble and the dish with lotsa greens (can’t remember the name now) and it was a good balance of meat, carbs and greens! Delicious, good service and neither stuffed nor starved. No complaints and happy to go back anytime!"
A returning customer,"3rd time. Brought my family along. Coffee was good, food was good. Tried brunch and tried dinner as well. Happy wife, happy life. 😬"
Happy tasty hub,Went ther for the steak brekkie and was NOt disappointed esp with the added bonus of the kambucha The service was efficient and the place clean and filled with the voices of the other patrons- almost forgot I was in the throes of omicron
very good,food is excellent. wish i could go back more often but need to watch spending . service was good too ☺️
Yummy Food,Love the Teriyaki salmon with healthy brown rice! The sticky date pudding is a nice dessert as well.
Great ambience and food,"Great ambience and food! Ordered waffles w chicken and it was delicious! Drinks were good too, usual cafe prices, would totally come back again for the waffle!"
Friendly staff and delicious food!,"It was a pleasant experience with lots of laughter as the staff was friendly and engaged in our queries to him and our jokes as well. Also gave great food recommendations to suit our needs, will definitely visit again!"
Late Afternoon Visit,Coffee was good. I had cod and leeks and my friend had french toast. No complaints from either of us on the items ordered or the coffee.
Excellent Service & Delicious Food,"Fantastic ambience. It was crowded but not too noisy. My friend and I could enjoy our private conversation despite the crowd.
We did not go for the signature dishes, went for Avocado Superfood Green Platter and Tuscan Lamb Harissa Baked Eggs, which were excellent.
Coffee was really good too."
Good atmosphere and food,"Went brunch with wifey. We are welcome with greeting and get a ground level seat near back windows and plants around. Service is good whereas response is fast . Food and drinks are served with nice setup. Overall, good experience and will sure be back again"
Great food & place for gatherings !,"Seafood grain bowl taste was good , less oily if you want a healthier food choice.
The spring pancake with fried chicken & ranch dressing was a great combination , the fried chicken was not greasy at all.
The tender slowed cooked beef cheek was perfectly done.
The dark chocolate add on buttermilk waffles topped with some citrus fruits sauce does not make your stomach feel heavy after a hearty meal."
Will be back!,"The flat white was really nice. We ordered the truffle wagyu don, breakfast of champions and the Tuscan lamb with ciabatta. Great menu choices and will be back to try their other dishes."
Nice ambience,Went on a Tues and there was still a short queue outside. Attentive and friendly staff. Great place to bring a date or hang out with girlfriends. :)
Lunch at Populous,The food is above average ordered the stewed beef cheek which was delicious. But the wagyu don is average. Also the cod with soba is also average.
Love their scrambled egg croissant,"Had a simple late lunch at The Populus on a weekday while we were in the area.

The interior of this cafe had this old warehouse feel with the brown metal claddings on the wall.

We ordered a scrambled egg croissant and truffle flies. Food were ready in quite a short time, impressed!

The croissant was yummy, not sure if it’s the right adjective to use but that’s the word that came to my mind.

Staff are friendly and prompt. Overall it’s a pleasant place for a afternoon coffee."
Excellent Food,It was my third visit and as always the food is oustanding. I was happy and excited BUT the mood was spoiled when we placed our order. The attendant's tone was off (I'm not sure if he was aware he sounded unhappy and unwilling when taking in our order). I felt unwelcomed thus ruin the experience. I was excited to introduce the place to my partner but it end up to an unpleasant start.
"Lovely food, great vibes","Food at populus never fails to satisfy the tastebuds! Only issue I thought could be improved would be the ambience on the 2nd floor. When it fills up with people, it becomes quite noisy and its hard to have a conversation - might want to consider some dampening features. My previous experience on the 1st floor was awesome though. Loved it better downstairs"
The Populus Coffee and Food Co - We will be back!,"Enjoyed all the food items we ordered, the mocha cold brew was delicious too! Will definitely visit again to try out other items on the menu"
1st time that wasn’t as pleasant,"It was a birthday dinner for a friend, was bragging about how nice my experience was when I dined few occasions with other friends so introduced this place to him but wasn’t as pleasant as there was no special gesture/attention given having mentioned it on my reservation and the guy with the long hair wasn’t as courteous and we were asked if we wanted to place last orders as if he wasn’t really happy. Not quite a good experience over all when i wanted to make it special for my friend. A little bit disappointed"
Relax cafe with gd brunch,visited on a weekday 12plus noon and considered crowded despite phase 3 heightened. Managed to grab 2 seats upstairs in 5 mins. Both the brunch and fired cod fish and chips were delightfully executed and tasted great. Will recommend for its relaying ambience to visit on a weekday with average damage per pax at ard $30+.
Overall good experience,The Populus has a great ambience. The white cold brew recommended. Friendly staff and also good service. Food was served immediately.
Lovely place,The ambience is great. Staff is friendly and helpful. Even gave us some recommendations when we are not sure what to order. The food is yummy! Would love to go again when we are allowed to do it..
good brunch restaurant,"walking distance from Outram MRT, good selection of all day brunch food . serving size is big enough to be eaten by 2pax and excellent and attentive service"
"Good Food, Great coffee","I really enjoyed the food and would highly recommend their French Toast. I do wish they have more vegetarian options. If you like coffee, try their Magic. It's magical :)"
Great vibes,Service was great and server tried to accommodate us when we just wanted to have coffee even though they were running full house. She so impressed us that we've decided to come back again to have a more leisure brunch. Service was great again and food was tasty. Will definitely be back.
Not to my expectation,"The cafe has a good reservation system. They will call to confirm your reservation when the date is near. The cafe has good decor on the ground level but not so much on 2nd level.
Service provided is minimal. Cafe is always busy and thus keeps to the time limit strictly and clears the plate the minute it’s empty, though they may not be so efficient when taking your order. Bill is issued the min the time is up."
wish meat cut was better,"went for brunch, chocolate drink selection and lobster scramble were good. however steak cut for Champions breakfast was tough, wish they had a better cut at that price."
Great food and vibes!,"The food and ambience at Populous is great, would highly recommend for meal or even coffee. The staff is friendly too, just make sure you book in advance as they are pretty pop..ular!"
Make reservation before coming!,Great food. Great coffee. Great cakes. Great service. And you can bring your laptop and work there. Only thing is the bad Wifi connection. Remember to make a reservation before coming down as it gets crowded during meal time.
Great food for value. Nice venue and service.,Enjoyed my time here. Was seated on the second floor. Was preferred actually as the serenity at the venue is nice for a brunch or lunch. Wanted a place for a quiet close conversation and the restaurant was perfect for it.
disappointing,"We went to celebrate a friend's birthday. Our last visit was a few months ago so each of us were hankering after certain food. So imagine our disappointment when we were informed that pork and pork related dishes have been removed as they were going halal. So we had to settle on whatever was available. The food quality had gone downhill substantially - imagine having to swallow fake bacon! Coffee was still good thankfully. Our server was nice but go even that they couldn't even handle the number of existing customers, what were they thinking trying to win additional customers? Really ? Just shows the owners' lack of respect for existing customers who have made them successful. We told the server that we will not be revisiting. Good luck- you have lost 6 customers. I wonder how many more will wake up and walk away."
Tuscany Lamb,"With Turkish ciabatta. Absolutely yums. Ordered 2 more ciabatta, they gave 4 cubes of butter. All the better to nosh into the plate of Tuscany Lamb!"
Nice place for Brunch,"Had a nice brunch with my wife on a Friday. Place was full and was happy to have made a reservation.
Although when I arrived they tried to first get me to sit on the second level which seems like an ""overflow"" place that also seemed to be used as an office by the manager.
Only when I objected they gave me a table on level 1.
Other than that food and service was good."
Awesome brunch @ The Populus Coffee,"Visited this cafe for the first time via reservation. We were seated somewhere in between the middle section, and water is served on every each table. After we settled ourselves in, we ordered a cup of black (full body) $5, a cup of mocha $7, The Populus Scramble $17 and Buckwheat Pancakes $18.

The man had his black, which he mentioned is not as strong as the one he had in Yahava. The Populus Scramble which he had is one of their signature food item. The presentation of the food looks great, with scrambled eggs, bacon topped on the croissant.

I had my mocha, which is light, smooth and not strong. It kind of lack of the chocolate flavor. Next I had the buckwheat pancakes. The pancakes were presented on a cast iron pan, with strawberries, blueberries, raspberry sauce and some butter. A little honey was served on the side. I love the pancakes bcuz they were so fluffly and the entire tastes so yummy. It reminds me of ""The Berry Farm"" in Tasmania

Overall we loved the food more than their coffee. We will definitely come back again to try other signature food items as well as their desserts

Rem to book your table before visit!"
Enjoying food and ambience,"It was our first time visited this restaurant. We had ordered few dishes; my friend and I enjoyed the food, and it was delicious."
Good food and service,"We went to populus for brunch with our baby.
Delicious food and great service.
My baby spilled her porridge, and the staff helped to clean the mess promptly.
We had the pancakes and chicken and fries and brioche. Portion sizes were generous and presentation and taste were great.
Will definitely re-visit."
Quality of food has decline and service is bad,"Food quality and service has declined. My food arrived 40 mins late as waitress forgot to key in the meal in the system despite us asking her on the status of the food.
When the food finally arrived “it was bounty of the sea”, it tasted mediocre, rice was too soggy and lacks the flavour it had before.
Definitely overpriced for the recent meal I had. Don’t think I ll come back again"
Excellent menu & coffee,"Extensive menu for brunch/lunch go-ers alike, with real good coffee. I ordered a gibralta and the coffee roast was perfect, and milk frothed to perfection and poured in nicely to blend with the beans. My friend ordered the beef cheeks and it was excellent.

Can't go wrong with a morning at Populus!"
Food is not as good as it look like,"The most famous scramble egg is overall good , but I don’t think the portion and the quality worth the price. First time trying out their pancake too and I think I waste the whole thing, it’s TOO SWEET even just by eating a bite. Should have more improvements on the food menu. The environment is just okay, I think it’s too overrated"
Nice,"Ordered 3 mains and a dessert for 2pm on a weekday afternoon. Surprisingly is still full house. Service is attentive and nice.

The scrambled eggs are too creamy/runny for my personal liking as the croissant got alittle too soft at the end.

Seafood linguine is nice with pasta being a little on the al-dente.

The star of the meal is definitely the strawberry elderflower with buttermilk waffles. A thin layer of waffle was placed to hold the icecream and making sure the waffle didnt get too soft at the end."
Moderate,"Food was kind of salty. We ordered 2 mains from all day breakfast and finished only 1/2 of each. Was kind of disappointed. However, their coffee was good."
Worth to Try!,Nice interior with good food and drink. Coffee is good and love the pancake so much! Overall good experience at here.
"Salty preserved meat in place of bacon, lobster bisque in scrambled egg","Food quality average. Disappointed that the bacon turned out to be preserved meat ... lobster bisque was added to the scrambled egg crab meat mix, lost its unique taste."
Not worth the price for food,"Good coffee and nice location but the food is not worth the price. Juice was not nice, brunch was very greasy and not up to my expectations at all. The coffee was very good however, and we enjoyed the setting."
"Cold Room, Cold Food, Disappointing Brunch","My family and I were underwhelmed with The Populus Coffee and Food Co. The food was pricey, portion sizes were small and the eggs came out cold. Additionally, the A/C was set too high and the room was frigidly cold."
Think twice !!,"They food is good .. think twice that your whole day mood will be spoil by they service ..
This is not my first time to visit the cafe .. but compare to last time the whole team ( service staff ) was change , coffee standards was drop also , only the food was still ok ..
Omg the service !!! I also work as F&B line been spoil by them ..

1) when I order 2 bottle cold brew mocha , but I notice I want to change white cold brew , so I went to the server that help me order to change my order . End up coming ice mocha .. also no problem ... I ask the serve I’m not order ice mocha my cold brew mocha aldy been serve but the person who send us the drink look like I own him thousands K !! Even he wearing mask I can feel he is no happy to serve us when we tell him we never order ice mocha .

2) when we order the populous bfast .. 1 lady serve told us no more bacon ..ask us want to change mushroom or smoke salmon ( add on $2 ) ...we fine and change to mushroom .. our food is come after 15 min our next table food also arrived..( they come after us around 20 min) they food also come fast but why between 15-20 min they order have bacon and told us we don’t have ... ?

When payment I ask the lady who help us order “ is me order wrong of the drink or you all send wrong “ she repeat tell me “ your order is ice mocha right after change from cold brew mocha “ ... so you never repeat my order is become my problem ?? Second I ask “ why tell us no more bacon but next to us few tables have “ she just reply me “ the bacon just come “ ... Wah ... 2 table serve between 5 min but never even ask us still want bacon or not ... not first come first serve ??

So pls think twice if want to come this cafe again !! Food no problem .... if can take it this kind of service standards ！"
Overated,"This was my second visit. However, quite disappointed on the food. I had seafood linguine, it's quite salty. Coffee is normal. Not worth to queue, so just make appointment in advance if you really wanna give a try. The waiter serving at the front door is not very friendly, its only 10+am and he looked like having a really bad day LOL However, the waiter which served at upstairs is great."
Great food!,We ordered the all day breakfast - Big Brekke and it was really yummy! The staff were very friendly and made our time at the restaurant very pleasant. They tend to our requests of serving plates as we shared the breakfast and desserts. My friends and I had not meet up together in this manner for a long time and so we are so glad to have chosen Populus for our lunch gathering.
They don't need your patronage,"We were regular customers. As soon as the lockdown was over, they were the first restaurant we returned to. Well I went there just now with my hungry family and the unwelcoming waiter told me high handedly, “We don’t have any tables. You will have to wait AT LEAST 45 min”. I understand about waiting, but you could be nicer in the way you phrase it.

Despite this impolite greeting, I smiled and gave my number, and agreed to wait. The guy said, “I will give you a call when there’s a table and you can let me know if you still want it.” . So we waited in a nearby bookstore... almost 1.5 hours. No call. The whole time, my phone was on the table, waiting for their call.

Went back. The first guy I checked with could not find any record of my name or number in his cracked iPad. Then another guy came out and said, “I called you many times, no one picked up, so we gave your table away.” He was absolutely unapologetic. He made it clear he felt it was my fault that he'd given away my table.

I said, “But I didn’t get any call. Look, there’s no missed call on my phone.” I showed him. The guy then glibly changed his story: “What about your Messages?”

I said, “I don’t normally check Messages. You didn't say you would message. I would have seen if it was WhatsApp. But you said you would call, so I waited and waited. Over an hour.” He said, “Well there’s nothing I can do as your table is already given away. You can wait again for the next available table.”

The guy sounded so irritated, you would think he was the customer who had waited over an hour and had his table given away...!!

I walked away to the restaurant next door, called The Lokal. It's a super popular place with a much nicer ambience... and you don't get treated like dirt there. I strongly advise you to go there instead! Or go to Beurre (French for 'Butter"") just down the road, where they are also nice to customers.

Almost 20 min later, Populus called me to inform me a table was available. Did I want it, they wanted to know. By this time, almost 2 hours had elapsed since I put my name down to join their waiting line.

I said quietly and sincerely, “I am never coming back again.”
“Sure , no problem,” the Populus guy replied immediately.

Populous thinks it is doing great; they do not need your patronage. If you choose to wait for ages, or are willing to go at odd hours, and don't mind being treated very rudely, they will eventually give you a table. But why do that when there are so many other wonderful places to go to instead?"
Never disappoint me with good food and service,"Never get disappoint with Populus, their food quality and service. It’s my regular cafe spot with friends."
"nice cafe, good food, but rather pricey","just 2 mains and a coffee chock our bill to over $60. food is actually quite good, portion size decent yet not impressive, but still feel that they're rather overpriced. Their dessert (soft serve ice cream on waffles) looks really good though."
Love it!,Been there twice in a month. Service is great. Food is tasty and very Instagramable. Would appreciate if picts are provided because not many of us esp e older groups use Instagram's etc to look at hoe their food looks like. Esp for old folks.
Popular Gastro-pub with endless flow of clients,"Such a popular cafe frequented by young people. Fast and friendly service and delicious healthy food to boot! We had the slow cooked beef tender cheek served with crunchy spinach/kale and mash potato. And we also tried the slow roasted chicken with wild brown rice grain bowl, filled with lots of veggies like mushrooms, pumpkins, red cabbage, zucchini etc. We love the refreshing iced lychee with rose oolong tea."
"Great coffee, ok food but overpriced",Went here with the family because reviews were so good but we were not super impressed by the food...mainly because the price! We had breakfast and lunch items and while the FrenchToast was super tasty (and sweet) it was more of a desert item and not breakfast. The FT was like $22 and didn’t come with anything savory. The lunch item was small and dry. The coffee on the other hand is very good and I would recommend this place for a coffee and sweet for sure. The atmosphere was really cool and service was fine too.
Nice Breakfast Place,"Came with the family for breakfast, stepping in felt like I was taken to another place. Had the Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich, crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Yumz . They made my daughter a smoothie off the menu too really appreciated that. She had just visited the dentist and this was a great treat for her."
Amazing food,"This place has great food. It is a typical cafe vibe along Neil Road and amazing amazing food. We went for lunch and the place was quite empty. We ordered from their weekday lunch menu. The pancake chicken was too good, the fried chicken was really flavourful and the Tuscan lamb was super tender and lots of flavours. I think it value for money too. Overall I would come back here for a quick lunch."
scrumptious brunch with ease,"Being able to ""Chope"" the seat in advance really helps to save the time as upon arrival I realised the reservation has been taken up to 3PM for the walk-ins as at 10:45am. The meal was awesome and we were welcomed with friendly staff. Not to forgot their hearty buckwheat pancake which is a must try."
Must go!,Love the food though the prices maybe abit steep... food presentation is beautiful and coffee is nice... worth going with your friends !
Catching up with Friends/ ex-Colleagues/ Colleagues,"Food is fantastic. Like the way the dishes are prepared and presented. Noise level can be unbearable if full house, regardless level 1 and/ or 2."
Super yummy food!,"Delicious fare slightly on the pricey side. Chocolate drinks are a must-order, delightfully rich and chocolatey 😋"
Definitely a must to visit,"Populus has wide variety of food options that taste delicious and plated nicely. It is a cafe but it serves quality food. While the pricing may seem on the high side, it’s definitely worth the pricing as the serving is hearty
The noise level could be on the high when all the tables are occupied, but other than this, the good food and coffee will be able to keep you focus on the plate"
Awesome place for brunch!,"Nice coffee, good food and ambiance. Best to make reservation earlier as it is usually fully booked."
Creative Dishes,"I love their fusions on dishes. You can feel mixture of culture just like Singapore, and they are so sophisticated. In adddition, their coffee is so nice & freshly just roasted, then I am briging back them to my home."
