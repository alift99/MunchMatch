The Best Chinese Restaurant in Singapore,"Just realized that we have been a customer here for more than 10yrs.
Our reservation has increased to 7pax, including our 2 young boys.
It has been our regular venue for celebrations, e.g. birthdays, anniversaries, Father's Day, Mother's Days, etc. and of course, Chinese New Year.
The place is undoubtedly classy, great for both casual and formal gatherings. And yes, my customers were impressed too, not just by the quality of the food, but also the impeccable service by Bryan and his team.
Their Peking duck is always in our list, together with the variety of dim sum.
Throughout the years, we always meet the familiar faces here including Darren and Abby, who are always attentive to our needs (from the old folks to the young guns) and became more of a butler and friend.
We are grateful to those special arrangement by Bryan. He really made these special moments memorable (by default, the pictures here are already instagrammable). We particularly love the longevity buns and the giant puddings!
With the just begin, and many more celebrations to come, I believe Cassia is going to continue to be part of our memories for a long time."
Fantastic Chinese Fine Dining,Love dining at Cassia for any occasion. Definitely on the pricier end but the food is absolutely delicious. Service is impeccable as well. Their drinks are lovely and especially enjoyed their fruit teas. The setup and ambience of the place is absolutely beautiful as well. I’ve been multiple times and will continue to go!
One of the best Cinese meals ever,"I have had well over 10000 Chinese meals and this would rate in the top 10. We had the best Beijing duck followed by the garlic prawns. Both faultless. Service was excellent.
One tip, if you are walking to the restarant ask them to pick you at the bottom of the drive in their buggy. It is a steep climb"
Outstanding Asian Cuisine,"This restaurant deserves all the accolades it receives. I am not usually a big fan of Asian cuisine, but this place takes it to a whole new level. We were not sure how large the portions would be and so when we added another dish to our order the waitress stepped in and said, you should have enough with what you have already ordered, but if you need more when everything comes I will get it for you straight away, which impressed me. When the food arrived true to her word we had ordered enough.
The quality of the duck and the Wagyu beef were both excellent, and I have no doubt we will return on our next visit to Sentosa."
Excellent service at Cassia,"I dined with my partner at Cassia last week and as usual, always have an amazing time. Food was fantastic and service was on point. The Dim Sum and double boiled soup is the best! Bryan and Darren provided a warm welcome upon my partner's and my arrival. The entire Cassia team was very attentive to us and anticipated our needs. Without having to ask, our tea was always topped up; the moment we are done with our course, plates were cleared. It may seem like a simple task, but the level of attention was top notch. They made the dining experience at Cassia so seamless. Keep up the good work and special mention to Bryan and Darren! Thank you for your excellent service and hospitality!"
Good experience. Try the dim sum!,"The main dining room has Nice ambience. Good for a treat / nice meal out.

We really enjoyed the dim sum and the soup - Interesting flavours.

We had Very good service.

Do note that access to the restaurant requires you to climb and descend stairs. You may want to take note if hv elderly guests."
Spectacular,"Exquisite food served in a warm and cozy environment. Exclusive and well attended by staff who has great attention to details.

Very impressed with our server Abbie, who made excellent recommendations about their lychee oolong tea and other dishes which was refreshing and fragrant.
She is attentive and so hospitable and made the entire experience even more amazing!

Thank you! Will be back again. ❤️"
Dinner,"Special thanks to Bryan and his team(Cassia) for providing excellent service and great food during our visit for dinner. Great place for the locals and international guests. We had a party of 4 and all of my friends loved everything that Bryan help us arranged to order. Beautiful restaurant with a great food, amazing atmosphere and great services. I highly recommended Cassia at any time."
Exquisite Food and Commendable Service at Cassia,"We had a good dining experience at Cassia for our wedding anniversary on 21 March 2022. The food presentation was impressive and the service rendered by Al Maavof Bi was superb. The restaurant even surprised us with a small cake as a kind gesture to end our celebration on a positive note.

We will recommend Cassia if you are looking for a memorable dining experience on Sentosa Island."
Haute chinois,Sleek and haute Chinois styling greets you with posh open arms at Andre Fu’s well designed restaurant. Dim sum skins were so delicate they break at the probe of the chopsticks. Egg yolked soft shell crab was so flavourful and even the bland looking scallop porridge packs an explosion of flavours. Come decked in your designer garbs. This place is for the well-heeled. #eatstylishtravelstylish
Superlative service!,"Singapore makes for a fantastic culinary destination — with so many fabulous choices readily available, fine-dining options almost seem a dime a dozen.

So while the quality of food at Cassia is as great as expected for a 5 star establishment — it was the superlative service that elevated the whole dining experience at Cassia for me.

In this regard, Jess K. in particular deserves a standing ovation and special kudos for her deft and consummate service!

Cassia appeared particularly busy today, with many guests requiring ""special attention"" — it is an especially high pressure position to be in, when one has to impeccably cater to every guest's needs and do it under timing pressure — but Jess seemed to effortlessly take it all in stride!

Further complicating the many other guest demands Jess was already concurrently juggling — my dining party consisted of individuals with differing dietary requirements that she had to patiently help us address. It was obvious we weren't the only diners she was serving, but nonetheless her delivery of such personable and attentive service made us feel as though we were the only VIP table in the entire restaurant!

She took the time to expertly discuss the various menu options — and always offered creative recommendations/adjustments that allowed us enjoy a fabulous meal together without having to compromise the differing dietary needs of anyone in my dining party. She always seemed to just appear at the perfect moment to check in on our party — interjecting just the right amount of unintrusive, amiable banter to make sure everything was meeting our dinning expectations, while also discreetly seeing to whatever extra little touches were needed to ensure every detail at our table was in top shape.

Nowadays, it is so easy to spend good money on good food almost anywhere in Singapore, but more of a rarity whereby the service takes almost equal billing with the food, no? And in the case of Cassia, this definitely holds true for me.

So thanks Jess K. for being such an integral part of making my dining experience at Cassia such a worthwhile joy!"
Impeccable Service and Food at Cassia,"Visited Cassia today 15 March 2022 with my husband after reading positive reviews on google review and it really didn't disappoint.

Upon reaching Cassia, I was warmly welcomed and served by the super friendly service staff, Jess.
She was very attentive and made great recommendations. We have ordered 5 spiced Pork Belly, Prawn with Glass Noodle in Clay Pot, Wagyu Beef with Black Pepper Sauce, Sweet and Sour Pork and Fried Rice with XO Sauce. All tasted great especially the Wagyu Beef.

Thanks Jess for the memorable experience! Strongly recommend to those who have not yet visited before."
Exquisite Cantonese restaurant Cassia (capella sentosa),"Awesome dinner at the Cassia. Exquisite dishes all prepared with the freshest of ingredients. Even the simple xo sauce condiment was one of the best. The iberico char Siew and Peking duck, a must have. So good was the dinner, I went back for the dim sum the next day and it did not fail. From humble Siew mai to the truffle char Siew…all done faultless. The wine list unrivaled…and well paired by the sommelier based on what we ordered.
No meal of this quality is ever possible without the experience and the service team delivered top notch attentiveness to our entire meal. A special mention to Jess for making our evening, with your friendliness and attention to every detail. Kudos to the F&B manager Madam Law for leading such an amazing crew.
I highly recommend Cassia!"
"Cassia Restaurant. Top Notch Food, Excellent Service","Beautiful culinary surprises and creativity at every turn, with excellent service from Jess and the rest of the crew. Easily one of the best restaurants in Singapore. Thank you for the wonderful dining experience."
Highly recommended yum cha ala carte buffet breakfast,"This yum cha ala carte buffet breakfast was started only recently, so my wife and I were so fortunate to have had this option of dining here during our weekend staycation! The food was so good, including the dim sum, congee, and various noodles. Definitely value for money here. Shoutout to staff Kenneth who on 6/3/2022 walked us to a special lift so my heavily pregnant wife didn't need to walk down the stairs after our meal. Thank you, Cassia!"
Glistening Peking Duck had me coming back,The Peking Duck is the stand out dish at Cassia. Carved at you table & served in a variety of ways of your choice it seemed to be at every table.
Outstanding Chinese restaurant on Sentosa Island (Singapore) in elegant surroundings with excellent service and ambience,"I visited 3 times in one week of my trip to Singapore.

The food quality, service, wine and ambience was top notch on each occasion. I preferred to sit outside on the terrace but inside looked very comfortable also.

Dim sum quality was outstanding, tasting menu really interesting and well executed, and a la carte dinner allows you to choose your favourite dishes.

Service from Jensing and Darren was very friendly and efficient with good food recommendations. Bryan handled reservations and arrival with great efficiency.

Prices are possibly only slightly at higher end but excellent value for money for the quality of the whole experience, in my opinion.

Very highly recommended."
Birthday party for my best friend.,"We had an amazing time at Cassia and staff had very lovely service during our lunch. They are superb and introduced us many nice dishes. Jess, a wonderful staff at Cassia, took good care of our table and provided a surprise Birthday cake for my friend. Wow…"
I returned again and was not dissappointed,"Me and my husband were again able to visit this restaurant, after having made it to Singapore again to visit family after 2 1/2 years. We immediately booked again to go to Cassia for lunch, twice!!! We had dim Sum and Peking duck. The food was really good, and the service was attentive. In fact the waiters seemed to remember us from a few years ago."
Incredible service & food as always! Thank you Jess!!,"This is our 3rd or 4th time to Cassia, and every single time we have thoroughly enjoyed the great food here. We had Jess serving us today, and from the onset she was already very attentive and fantastic in giving recommendations! And for some amazing reason, she gave my wife a small cake for her birthday even though we never mentioned to them about it. Truly awesome!

Needless to say, we will be back again in the future. We love the ambience here :)"
Cassia restaurant,Food was immaculate. Jess was accommodating and friendly. Her advice to order the food portions were perfect for us! Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!
Lovely Meal and Superb Service,"Attended a wedding lunch at Cassia and was most impressed by awesome service from the manager Bryan and Jess who attended to our table. The meal was lovely but it was the service that truly bowled me over.

The sole of my shoe gave way just as we were walking to our table. Almost immediately after I sat down and was fretting about my shoe, Jess appeared and discreetly offered me a rubber band to hold the base of my shoe together. Minutes later, while my family and I were still talking about how impressed we were with Jess' attentiveness, Bryan came by and offered to fix my shoe as he could get his hands on some super glue. Thanks to Bryan and Jess, I was able to fully enjoy my cousin's wedding and the scrumptious food instead of being distracted by a faulty shoe!"
Amazing experience,"Back to Cassia for dimsum lunch! Greeted by Hostess Elaine who was meticulous and constantly reminded us on steps on our way up to the restaurant!
We were served Jess who recommended the best dish which is salted egg soft shell crab. Jess remembered that I like XO sauce and she gave me more during our meal. We liked the truffle pork bun which is soft and fluffy on the outside and full of flavour on the pork filling!
We were served by Bryan and Darren as well who made our dining experience a pleasant one.
Would be back again!"
Wonderful Experience at Cassia (Manager Bryan is Awesome!),"To round off our honeymoon experience, we had lunch at Cassia. They were very nice to accommodate us at such short notice. The moment we entered, we were wowed by the ambience, food and stellar service from the professional and caring staff! Restaurant manager Bryan was particularly warm and helpful! His recommendations and extra touch really go a long way. THANK YOU so much!"
Happy new years eve dinner with cassia,"Yesterday's New year's eve menu was really value for money! Once again, thanks Bryan for always being able to cater to our dietary requirements. It is always a very good dining experience under Bryan's supervision. Special thanks to Abby for attending to our table and Eileen, the sweet and friendly hostess with the warmest welcome."
Very good food and excellent service!,"Visited a couple of days ago with my family for dinner. Our server, Jess, was incredible! Super attentive, polite, professional, and helpful. The food was also great — would recommend the chef’s signature set. Particularly enjoyed the chicken soup! Overall a great experience!"
Always good!!!,"Once again, excellent meal! Love their chicken double boiled soup, cod fish, fish maw and desserts (almond cream and Lotus seed bird nest). And service is always good despite the heavier crowd given festive season. Will go back for sure! Keep up with the great work Cassia"
Proposal night in Cassia Capella,"Best Chinese restaurant we have ever been. Great taste, great fragrance, great presentation, elegant ambience and awesome service. What more can you ask for?
Bryan even helped us with our impromptu
proposal and acted along to ensure it was a lovely surprise to end the night."
Mdm,Awesome and super friendly waitress Jess. We have Pleasent evening with their recommended wine. We were actually late for our reservation but they are nice enough to still let us have private room
Chinese Cassia,"Stayed at the capella and had dinner here. The menu doesn’t have all the typical cantonese dishes. Some items are also priced at per person. Don’t order the prawns with kumquat sauce. At $20 for 2 small prawns, that is low value. Service is very good, convivial and almost hilarious

"Great food, Awesome Service","Had a lovely evening gathering with friends at this great restaurant. Every dishes was delicious and excellent! Good ambience and great service.

Cassia,"We are here for my mum’s birthday celebration and we were very pleased with Ms Jess prompt and friendly deposition, introducing the dishes that was being served.

Nice food and ambiance, highly recommended!"
"Great food and ambience, amazing service!!","Always great to visit Cassia - Food is superb and incredibly delicious! We also had the greatest pleasure of being served by Jess, who is charismatic, entertaining, and incredibly knowledgeable in all the dishes.

Truly a great experience and looking forward to our next visit!"
"Capella stay, dim sum masterclass and cassia",Capella will never disappoint. If you have time must sign up for their dim sum master class! Chef ming is the best and so is Jess from cassia.
Great place for special occasions,"We enjoyed our dinner at Cassia. The decor was immaculate. The food quality was excellent. Would like to compliment Jess, who was really attentive and caring in her service."
very Classy and elegant restaurant,Very nice food and professional waiter. the restaurant is very formal . so you need to dress suitably. Food was very nice and the setting was lovely. the only problem was getting back to our hotel late at night.It would have been a good idea for such a restaurant to offer a transfer to and from local hotels.
Lunch visit,"Had lunch here on the first day of our staycation, it was beautifully decorated and the food was tasty. Didn’t feel like it was super special though"
"Loved it, will go back again!","My second time to this gorgeous restaurant. This time we had dim sum… the dishes were absolutely delicious. Enjoyed every dish, service staff was attentive and had good knowledge of their product. Service was excellent. Restaurant was quiet ( though it was full) and calm. An oasis! Really enjoyed our whole lunch experience."
Outstanding experience,"Went for dinner. Excellent food and service! Delightful experience. The soups, lobster, beef, desserts are just outstanding, and so is their service! Will be back for sure"
Great service and food!,"Was here for dinner, really appreciate the service by Jess and Jashan! Jess was friendly and gave us great recommendations. Will be back!"
Excellent service and food,"Ate here twice as a guest of the hotel. The dim sum and ala carte menu were great! Unique and delicate flavors with the dim sum. The roast meat platter was fantastic alongside w the tofu dishes.

Great service w both Bryan and Jess. Attentive, professional and warm.

Highly recommended!"
The cassia energy,"Special mentions to Bryan and Darren, both gentlemen never failed to make us feel like home whenever we dine in cassia despite our 2 years of absence due to Covid. Everytime I sat there waiting for my surprise menu, I am so filled with ewe by watching the team move around with their duties with such ease and professionalism. Surprisingly, I dont see much interaction between the staff but with the guests instead. The energy and dedication from cassia team spells nothing but remarkable!!! A tip which I must share, have them plan out your menu, sit and relax, cassia knows exactly what to do."
Wonderful visit as always,"This must have been our 5th time staying at the Capella, the service and amenities don’t disappoint! Crowd control was great and well managed. Our son loved staying in the villa where he enjoyed the private pool tremendously. Food at the Knolls, in-room service and Cassia were fantastic - try the Laksa, prata, burgers at the Knolls; dim sum, Peking duck, trio platters and soups at Cassia. Lovely warm service from Jess at Cassia and service staff at the Knolls who catered to our tricky dietary requirements with much ease! We will be back!"
Dinner at the Cassia,Had dinner here on our first night at the Capella. The service was above excellent as the wait staff were attentive to our needs. The food was great and the duck was true to its fame.
Great Dim Sum with Great Service!,"Great atmosphere at Cassia! We had dim sum for lunch and the food quality was excellent. Ingredients were fresh, one can taste the freshness in every item. Service was wonderful as well, we were served by Ms Jess Khoo, who was attentive to all our needs and so super friendly. Many thanks to the restaurant for the birthday surprise too, we love it!"
Lunch at Cassia,"The lunch set menu was fantastic. I got the GHA lunch menu.
The food quality was exceptionally good and I can say this is probably one of the better Chinese restaurants in singapore.
Service here was also fantastic. All the staff came across very friendly and some even had small chats with us along the way. Jess was one of the service staff and her ability to engage was exceptional.
Will definitely come back again in the future."
Wonderful Dinner,"Had a wonderful family dinner, the food was great. Service was excellent as well and Jess was accommodating. Enjoyable dining experience and the kids love it too!"
"Wonderful Lunch and Exemplary Service @ Casis, Capella Hotel, Sentosa","The GHA discovery lunch was really good and Jess’ service was top notch and she very very attentive, explaining the pairing of the 3 types of tea which was excellent."
Great service from Jess,"Hi management of Capella,

So far we enjoyed the service provided overall. Your staffs are very polite from buggy services, pool attendance etc…. especially Jess from Cassia restaurant. She took care of us from the moment we stepped in till we leave, ensure we are enjoying our meal and making sure she accommodate our needs if there’s any.

Thanks!

Kelvin"
AMAZING,It is always a challenge eating by yourself but on an extended stay at the Capella I took the plunge and moved from the Bar and Room Service to Cassia. So glad I did - unique and wonderful with service to match.
Best Restaurant to Hold Your Wedding,"Thanks Bryan, Darren and team for making my wedding so memorable and fun!! You guys made the wedding run seamlessly without a hitch!

My guests definitely loved the food and service that you colleagues gave. Some loved it so much that they will be back again to enjoy the food!!

WE WILL BE BACK!!!"
Outstanding service,"The food was authentic and full of heart, and so was the service. We went for 2 consecutive days to try the dim sum and dinner and Cassia did not disappoint. Jess made sure we had everything we needed and she did it all with the warmest smile that even a mask couldn’t hide!"
Amazing dinner and service!,"Had the signature set for 2, and the food was top notch! Even better was the service. We had a great waitress (Jess) who really chatted with us and explained the different dishes and tea. At one point we were so full she even recommended that we take a short break, and helped us to hold our dishes till we could resume.

All in all an excellent experience, and would definitely come back to try their other dishes (their pekingese duck looked really good as it was rolled by on a trolley).

One piece of advice though: come with an empty stomach."
Amazing food and fantastic service!,The service by Jess was impeccable. Felt very welcomed and was very friendly. The food was amazing! The wagyu was so tender and the glutinous rice was so flavourful. Extensive wine list as well with value for money wines. Definitely coming back again!
"Great experience, excellent food and service","We really enjoyed the set lunch as the staff accommodated to our requests (one set without meat, only seafood). The service was excellent and the food was very fine. We had a great time and ate very well. The atmosphere was very serene and the restaurant quite classy. Perfect for a romantic couple experience and fine cuisine!"
Had a lovely evening at Cassia.,"Had a lovely evening at Cassia. The food was good but the service was impeccable. A special mention to Jess who helped us with the choice of food and served us. Cheerful and attentive manager who made the evening extra special. One of the best service we had across restaurants we visited. Keep up the incredible work, Jess!"
Lovely manager!,"Beautiful atmosphere with exquisite and delicious dim sum. Ms Jess, the manager was so friendly and helpful in making choices about the food.
As it was my husband’s birthday, we were given a little cheese cake for his celebration as well!
Thank you so much for your thoughtfulness!
Will definitely visit again."
Great dining experience at Cassia,"The overall experience was excellent. Food was good, but the service was better. We were waited by Jess who gives good recommendations. Bubbly character with full of humour. Also, very attentive to diner’s needs. Not pushy at all and would always recommend dishes and drinks that are value for money. Would definitely come back again after this experience."
Awesome service,Had a family lunch celebration for my mum at cassia. Very good service from Jess who served us. She is knowledgable abt the dishes and ingredients as well :)
Disappointing celebratory dinner at Cassia,"Solid place for Cantonese food but terrible for celebrations.

Food wise a few of their great dishes include the HK roast meat platter, Cantonese soups, and avocado dessert.

Most disappointing part, staff did not recognize the special occasion for us despite us mentioning it a few times during dinner and also us staying at the hotel which also knew since it was on our booking. Also from what we saw they celebrated another table's birthday but did not do anything for our babymoon celebration even despite a request by my husband who would have paid for something to be done. Staff just ignored the request. Disappointing way to end our celebration and stay at Capella."
Jess the warmest and most helpful at Cassia!,"It was our first time dining at Cassia. It truly took us by surprise that the dishes were so well prepared and presented, especially the cod fish with black garlic. On top of that, Jess was absolutely helpful and attentive to details such as our dietary requirements. Despite of not being able to celebrate CNY back in our hometown, Jess truly made the whole dining experience felt like home. Kudos to her and her team!"
Hidden gem,"Actually i never heard much about Cassia until the LE experience thanks to GHA membership. Had their GHA Discovery set lunch here on 10Feb. It was a 5 course with 3 different types of Chinese tea. Service is impeccable and food presentation & quality was great. I went through their normal ala carte menu and i think their prices are very decent too, definitely now on my to go place for good Chinese meals."
Kohinoor of Singapore- Best veg Chinese ever - serve by Abby a treat.,"Service by Abby was out of the world. never seen such good service in Singapore and also in my 700 plus reviews. dimsum are superb . 4 veg soup sweet corn and bamboo we tried both superb. also have to try Vietnam roll. fried rice noodles and maps tofu were superb. outstanding food and service. thanks to abby , I had one of my meals in my life. the have separate menu for vegetarians."
Excellent fine Chinese Cantonese,Excellent fine Chinese Cantonese food restaurant inside Capella Singapore. Attentive services and good taste.
Supercedes all expectations,Really attentive service from Bryan and his team! Food absolutely exceeded all expectations. Rare find and thankful we had the opportunity to dine there :) have made another reservation to be back!
Excellent contemporary Chinese cuisine,"We finally managed to get a table for lunch on our last day of our staycation. The entire restaurant is done up beautifully, and it was a treat for our eyes as well as our tastebuds.

Every single staff was super helpful, particularly when I mentioned I couldn't have pork/lard. The nice waiter even picked out another chilli sauce that I could have - I'm truly grateful.

My husband has the set lunch, and I ordered some dim sum, the wagyu beef, foie gras with caviar as well as the prawn noodles with superior broth. Every single dish was presented beautifully on top of being tasty! I honestly was too full for dessert, but they presented a divine flower jelly with mango puree that was so yummy I couldn't help but have it all.

Totally worth it - we'd make the trip to Sentosa just for a meal at Cassia."
In room dining was excellent!,"Ordered a couple of soups, roast meat, baked cod and found it to be one of the better in room dinings in my life. Would try again!"
Cassia at Capella never fails.,"Cassia at Capella never fails. We have been frequenting the restaurant for close to 5 years and have always been delighted by the great company, conversations and food that the staff in the restaurant devote to take care of us.
Big thanks to Lai Yong, Bryan, Darren, Abbey and the team at the restaurant for maintaining such world class standards at every meal, despite the pressures of this pandemic!"
Fond Memory,"Besides the authentic Cantonese cuisine, the outstanding service provided by your staff members had made our dining experience heart-warming. Being a grand daughter of the pioneer batch of Banquet Designers who made the China Dim Sum internationalize, Cassia’s history also made us recalled the fond memories how did my grandfather and team designed the dim sum banquets to serve the world’s leaders from various countries when they first visited China. We definitely will visit Cassia again."
Stunning!,"Would happily return here again and again. This is one of my fav Chinese restaurants in Singapore, along with Summer Pavilion. Thank you to Abby for consistently good service, as well as the rest of the team too. It's so nice to then go down to Bob's Bar for dessert or tea after lunch. Perfect time spent at Capella!"
Mind-blowing service and food,"It was our second trip to Cassia; within a week no less. We already knew that the food was going to be good and we were definitely not disappointed. But what blew us away this time was the fantastic service provided by Bryan.

I was pregnant and jokingly teased my husband for taking the last piece away from me. It was just a passing remark and I thought no one else beside my husband heard me. I intended to order another portion of that dish but even before I could Bryan appeared with another portion of that dish and served it to us!! He insisted it was on the house as he couldn’t let a pregnant lady not eat what she want! I was so touched by his gesture, but more amazed at how meticulous and thoughtful he was!

Later we also realised that throughout the course of our meal we never needed to ask for his help because he always manages to anticipate our needs!

Impeccable service and delicious food, there really is no reason not to dine here!"
Great restaurant with great food and service,"Had my solemnisation in Cassia. The food is great and the service provided by the staff far exceeded our expectations. Thank you to Bryan, Jess, April and team for helping to make our special day so memorable."
Enjoyable visit with tip top service and food,"We were celebrating birthdays for 2 friends. Made reservation with Bryan, manager of the chinese restaurant, Cassia in Capella hotel, Sentosa. When he know about the occasion, immediately he asked for names and quietly arranged 2 separate surprises, very impressed by his thoughtfulness. Food,wine and service standards, never disappoint us and frankly speaking, we feel like kings and queens! Thank you to Bryan and team in Cassia for a wonderful arrangement."
Celebration,"We had our solemnisation ceremony at Cassia and everything was just beyond perfect. We cannot thank Bryan and his team for all the detailed arrangement, decorations and excellent services. All my guests love the food and beyond words for the services. We were so glad Alkaff Mansion screwed up on our initial booking or we would never have found Cassia. Thank you Bryan. You are the best!"
Fabulous Dim Sum in luscious colonial setting,"Lovely morsels of delectable dim-sum served by such attentive staff, led by Assistant Restaurant Manager Anthony Yap, no wonder my parents were thrilled to bits. The food was good, the ambience was pleasing, and the staff, excellent. There was no disturbing clinking of dishes and cutlery by the side tables or noisy lunch crowds, just an elegant and spacious restaurant which allowed much privacy and quiet for the guests. Will definitely return"
Much over rated,"We had a menu of the six courses signature menu, strongly recommendes by the waiter. Most courses tasted just deep fried. The Lobster was overcoocked and chewy.
Waiters were kind and attending and interior decorarion was nice.
But all in all the lowest level of food compared to price in a restaurant for years, a big disappointment."
"Some slip-ups and salty, otherwise good meal","We were at Cassia for a Saturday lunch after reading many positive reviews.

An unexpected welcome drink at the hotel served by a cheerful staff once we stepped off the taxi made us anticipate the lunch ahead. Unfortunately, we were directed to the restaurant by the nearest way - thoughtful but the helpful staff might have overlooked that there was an elderly among us. What lay ahead were two flights of stairs to the restaurant. The receptionist at the foot of the stairs told us that the nearest lift was quite a walk away. Bummer.

The restaurant was nice and quiet even though many tables were occupied, and my group was pleased. However, the menu took its time to reach us and the set-lunch menu was absent. I enquired about it but the lady who passed us the menu wasn't exactly pleased and it showed. Not very obvious, but still. She went off to get the other menu and came back with an unenthusiastic expression.

From there on service from all other staff was pretty good except another slip-up: there was a mistake on our choice of dim sum. The items that were affected were the ones we were very keen to try. Disappointed but didn't alert them as we just wanted to carry on with the lunch.

For what the set-lunch includes, it should be good value for money. The food was not bad and was at a level I would not mind going back for. However, the meal was ruined because every course we had was a tad salty except the desserts. Both ingredients and cooking was a good level but what was with the overuse of salt in every single course? It was frustrating.

The black sesame paste with pumpkin dessert was good. The soup was good but for the salt. The teas were good. (Oh, I just realised that we were not served the homemade Hawthorn tea that's included in the set. The teas we had were ordered separately).

The day was saved by a staff when we were ready to leave the restaurant. We caught hold of the staff (but sadly not his name) and asked for the direction to the lift. Not only did he show us the right exit to use, he took the initiative to walk us to the nearby service lift and answered any questions we had of the hotel (I was thinking of checking into Capella for a concert on the island). Not only was he able to answer the questions, he was able to offer more nuggets of information about the hotel. He even accompanied us all the way downstairs.

Thanks to him and the other staff we met at the hotel and restaurant, I am able to put the disappointing meal aside and may check into Capella when the opportunity arises.

."
It just gets better,"3rd time coming back to this restaurant, service just gets better, thank god one of the staff Darren still recognize us and was very helpful in recommending us the best dishes.... can see his passion in this industry, well done! Food here is indeed really good knowing the same chef is behind the scene. Peking duck was the best pick for me.... and oh, the mooncake left a deep memory for me to come back knowing it’s not for sale..."
Amazing,"We came to Cassia for husband's birthday celebration dinner in 7 August, amazed by the excellent yet non-pretentious services by all the staff on duty on the night."
Great food and service!,"We went there on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and was served by Jess. We had a set menu and was treated to a sumptuous 8 course meal. The dishes were presentable, high quality and absolutely delectable.

What made us even more satisfied was the service rendered by Jess. She took the time and effort to explain every dish that was presented to us, and even took the effort to show us around the hotel after our meal.

We were very satisfied with our lunch at Capella, and we will be back soon!"
Enjoyable lunch enhanced by the pampering staff,"We came for a Sunday lunch and the ""easy to park"" basement carpark is fully redeemable. On arrival, I was thrilled by the lovely decor and our seats were very comfortable. Three of us chose the set menu which costs a reasonable $59 each. It consists of a choice of six dim sum items, soup, a choice of three meat in dainty portion, a choice of noodles (5 types to choose from) and a choice of dessert. My husband ordered ala carte as he was on a vegetarian diet. All of us had a complimentary glass of hawthorn juice and a dainty appetiser. The dim sum was tasty and not salty. The seafood noodle was very impressive. They gave a complimentary dessert to my husband. We also had a small piece of cheese cake with a candle as we were there on my daughter's birthday.
The service was especially good and we felt really pampered by them.
After lunch, we walked to view the plaque signifying the meeting spot for the Trump-Kim Summit. I would strongly recommend a meal here to be pampered."
Fantastic meal!,"We chose Chef Lee's signature set with wine pairing. It was just simply delicious, one dish after the other. The wine pairing is a wonder, as each wine boosts the taste of the dish itself, which is what it is supposed to do. The setting is beautiful, and the service is just right, not too much, and not too little. It was a perfect evening for us. If you are looking for a modern Chinese restaurant, with a modern twist, this is the place to visit."
Wonderful Evening,"Had a wonderful evening with my colleges here. Our server Anthony went above and beyond during our dinner.
We had a group with dietary restrictions and everyone’s meal was wonderful.

We hope to return soon!"
Fantastic,Anthony was amazing. Great service and food. We had the duck special meal - very impressive! For sure will come back!

Amazing Wedding Lunch on 10th March 2018,"My wife and i have decide to hold the most important day of our life at Cassia Capella.

Cassia is by far the best cantonese restaurant we had ever been. Cassia created an outstanding and memorable wedding lunch of our life.
Service was remarkable, food was outstanding, presentation was flawless and the ambience was fantastic!! All our guests are singing praises during our wedding lunch. Cassia will truely deserve a michelin star soon!

Kudos to Bryan Pong and Lai Yong for everything!!

P.S for the late review"
Dinner,"Their passion is meticulous. From the dinning room to the kitchen, My lady and myself can feel the atmosphere, service and flavour in food the sincerity everyone took in their stride. Thank you so much for the Awesome dinner. Your gregarious restaurant is definitely worth at least a Michelin Star. 9/9. Will be back soon."
Excellent Lunch,"This is our first time to dine in Cassia. Their service is some of the best in town. The staff seems to truly care about the experience of their guests. This adds to the ambience of the restaurant. Our server Ms Jess was outstanding, very knowledgeable and helpful, and made our experience very enjoyable. The food is exquisite and delicious too. Thank you Ms Jess and rest of the staff for a wonderful afternoon! We will be back!"
"Excellent dim-sum in a quiet, beautiful setting!","We were a party of 8 and had a lovely Sunday afternoon having dim-sum at Cassia on the recommendation of our friend. They offer set dim sum as well as a la carte, we try the latter. A must order is the special pork bun, crystal dumpling and Peking duck. The charcoal flavoured pork bun and crystal dumplings (mushrooms and chicken filling) have truffle oil, their signature dim sum- very flavourful and juicy. It is an ideal setting for business lunch too, being so exclusive. Highly recommended for fine dining, price is on the high side understandably."
loved it,"he food at Cassia was brilliant - having eaten at Lung King Heen a few times (and other top Chinese places), we think this was the best food, decor, service for chinese good (with small scale set up and outside dinning option)."
Excellent Lunch and Great service,"We had a business lunch at Cassia. The food selection was excellent. Each dish is exquisite. The presentation is nice and food quality is good. Best of all, our server, Jess, provided great service. Her friendly batter and careful service really made a huge difference to the lunch atmosphere."
A dinner to remember!,"Outstanding menu and food, worthy of a Michelin star. Attentive, knowledgeable staff who even knows about the flower decor at entrance of the restaurant."
Another pleasing experience!,"Simply love Cassia!
The food is exquisite and delicious, the service impeccable as always.
So hubby surprised me with an impromptu late night dinner at Cassia..despite us both trying to lose some weight. Lol. We savoured every bit of every dish served!
Have been to Cassia for lunch, tea and dinners over the last 4 years and every experience is THUMBS UP!
The ambience is tasteful and exclusive. If you like your gatherings in calm soothing venues, and enjoy fine Chinese/Cantonese food, Cassia is the GEM!"
A place to impress your in-laws!,"If you run out of ideas to impress your in-laws or your date, and still want to have a Chinese meal ... head to Sentosa island. Nestled in Sentosa Capella Hotel is this charming Cassis ... you climb up a short flight of stairs to reach this tastefully decorated Chinese restaurant.

There is not a wide selection of dim sum but why need variety when you can have quality! The har-gao, crystal dumplings, congee and fried carrot cake are exquisitely prepared and served. The must-have is the char-siew bun with gold flakes! It is pricey but worth the spend for special occasion!"

It’s Not Worth It !,"We went there for a very special occasion. Having eaten at most of the “best” restaurants in Singapore, we wanted to try this one out.

1) Mind you we read the reviews; 65% good, 35% bad so we said we will decide for ourselves.
2) Whilst Capella is a beautiful hotel, this restaurant is tucked in the corner, flight of steps up (slightly darkish too)
3) Came by 6:45 - reservation was for 7.15. The staff were in the meeting. An elder day waiter (lady) said in Singlish; “Eh have to wait ah becaus we not open yet”. Can we leave our shopping bags and walk around ? “Can leah But we not responsibility!”. Okie then.
4) Came back - we were the only people for a while. Then slipper and shorts clad Chinese tourist poured in.
5) There are looots of reviews about the food - but honestly we have had Much Much Much better Cantonese food in Soo soo many restaurants, that this was a 5 outa 10
6) I’m not sure if the staff keeps changing but our staff was a 4/10 in helpfulness, attentiveness and explaining.
7) Sooo Not worth the price they charge!

So sorry guys it’s a 4 maybe a 5 outta 10 overall."
Outstanding service and food quality,"I have tried different Chinese restaurants around the world and I have to admit that this has been one of the best I have been to. The foods presentation was beautiful, for example there was this black charcoal bao with pork in it that had gold flakes on top of it, which looked beautiful. Overall, this is a great Chinese restaurant with exquisite food."
Birthday dinner with a birthday gal,"Being rather particular about what I enjoy in Chinese cuisine and considering what I wanted to introduce to a friend to enjoy, Cassia seemed like the natural choice, since I have enjoyed meals (such as when chef Jungsik came to Singapore and cooked at Cassia) here, with or without celebrity chefs. Being remembered by staff despite a slightly-over-a-year-long absence made me bashful.

Even without her favourite champagne from Ruinart, the birthday gal enjoyed what was available on the menu for champagne, including the Pu'er tea aged 30 years. It is nice to see the wine list has been refreshed and modified. She was very tempted to ask for a container of the XO chilli sauce served as condiments, which had me quite amused. I decided to stay safe, in choosing what we could enjoy.

We started with a complimentary dainty amuse bouche of refreshing tomato which I fondly remember, followed by appetisers of roasted duck with chilled jellyfish, Five-Spice roasted Yorkshire pork belly, and wok-fried crabmeat roll coated with salted egg yolk. The double-boiled thick chicken broth with fish maw, large juicy scallops and flower mushroom is a must. Steamed Scotland bamboo clams in garlic and soya sauce were very nice to follow, but I probably should have ordered the drunken prawns (due to her taste preference) instead of the 避风塘-style crispy prawns, which were large and juicy.

Of course, when there's only 2 people, it's hard to choose everything you want to eat, such as stewed sea cucumber with garlic and roasted pork belly in a claypot.

Vegetables were a tough choice, when dishes such as the wok-fried crispy eggplant with pumpkin and fresh mushrooms in salted egg yolk sauce beckoned but due to stomach space, we could only pick one, and went with the homemade braised tofu with dried seafood and seasonal greens.

By the time we were ready to proceed to Bob's Bar for desserts and cocktails (which I had also introduced her to), she had decided to bring her family to Cassia for dimsum and possibly try other dishes in the near future. Even with dietary limitations of beef and lamb, Cassia has plenty of choices. And it was an enjoyable birthday dinner, with impeccable service.

Cassia offers very good food at decent prices. Having tried so many other restaurants such as Summer Palace and Cherry Garden and those Chinese restaurants in Ion Orchard, I still prefer this place. I cannot take MSG or bad oil (or I have uncomfortable reactions), so there are many places I do not dine at. I should probably come more often :)"
An enjoyable night,"When a restaurant has a menu as extensive as that of Cassia, the natural worry would be whether the culinary skills match up. With respect to Cassia, delighted to say a ""yes"". Respect to the Executive Chef and team as almost every dish was very well-executed, particularly the doubled boiled chicken soup, sea cucumber and roast pork dishes.

Service was impeccable too. As the dinner was part of a birthday staycation celebration, had requested the restaurant to help store a birthday cake. The service team's professionalism is definitely worth a salute. Made multiple additional requests from taking the cake out from fridge to thaw the buttercream mid way through dinner, to setting the specific candle brought along, and the team accomodated and assisted with the surprise. The team also took the initiative to belt out a birthday song enthusiastically (whilst ensuring that the volume does not cause a disturbance to other dining guests). At the end of the dinner, the staff also took great initiative to pack our cake in take away boxes. Thank you so much team! Cassia and Capella management, you really have a great team there.

Would definitely be back. Till then, and thanks again for the wonderful night."
Pepper Softcrab and Mushroom Broth,The Softcrab fried with giner and white pepper was a wonderful delight! The Mushroom Broth was rich with flavorful aroma. Excellent food and great services.
