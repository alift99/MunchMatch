As always GREAT FOOD!,"We had a great time for my husband´s birthday, is his favorite restaurant. Food was amazing. We are so sad is closing. All staff was very nice as well."
The fall from grace of this once amazing restaurant,"Every time we visit Singapore, we have been coming to this Restaurant for many years since it first opened, and it is quite noticeable that the restaurants overall atmosphere is now very poor and we were rushed through our meal. Some of the original waitresses were still very sweet and attentive, but the later shift of waiters were not very good. The food was okay, but not as aromatic as it was when we last visited the place. It is a shame that this restaurant has been allowed to be run down. We had many fond memories of its past glory and it is sad to see it as it is now. Hope things will improve, if not it will be lost forever."
Lovely setting - pity it will be closed after 25 Dec 2022 !,Was there before Covid - loved the setup and the food. Hearing that they are closing permanently - had to make a trip once more. Daughter loved the place with the high ceiling - food was not too bad either.
Where has the Special Jim Thompson Spirit Home?,"We expected a fine Asian dining in an outstanding traditionnel Location but were highly disappointed.
We were placed in the middle of a crowdy, noisy Main dining room. Service was not client friendly, tried to speed us up, was not interested about our concerns. Food was acceptable however not fine or spicy in this typically JT‘s tradition.
Not to recommend any more"
Fabulous as usual,"We always love returning to Jim Thompson, it's one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore. The one negative comment I have is that we really miss the pre-Covid Sunday brunch buffet. We are hoping this returns soon."
Very disappointing dinner!,First time here and we chose this place based on good reviews but to our big disappointment the dishes tasted bland and below standard. Very over priced considering the poor quality ingredients used in the cooking. The only dish that was eatable was the beef tenderloin curry with a few beef cubes buried in a bowl of potato chunks.
delicious food and great service,We had an amazing dinner as usual. Lots of choices and all of them superb. Location and atmosphere top! Highly recommended
Excellent Thai cuisine in Singapore,"A fine dining authentic Thai restaurant in Singapore. We went there for lunch and were surprised when they offered us a complete vegetarian menu also for us.
We went for a set menu and were very happy with it. Each dish was very well made and loved having it. The Green Thai curry is not to be missed. Even the dessert Sticky rice with mango is a delicacy.
The service is impeccable would like to name Michelle who was very good."
Expensive Thai Food,"Lovely decor and good food, but really expensive for Thai food. Small serves and $7 for still water which in Singapore is always a rort!"
Excellent Restaurant,"We had lunched at the Minden Road, Singapore Restaurant.

The Ambience and Atmosphere are quaintly picturesque and attractive. We would single out the layout and decor of the garden and outdoors, including the veranda and entranceway, as particularly striking.

The food is superbly prepared and presented. All the dishes we had ordered were extraordinarily delicious. The quantities served are adequate.

The staff received us graciously and served us efficiently. The service is exceptionally delightful and the staff are personable, polite and particularly pleasant. The charming and cheerful demeanour and willingly helpful courteousness of all the staff are engaging.

Such excellence indicates noteworthy morale and all concerned from the top managers to the lowliest, least paid staff are deserving of appreciation. Please commend them as may be deemed appropriate.

(Jim Thompson Thai Restaurant and Wine Bar, Singapore are deserving of the attention of the Michelin assessors.)

We have had a memorable lunch.

"Wasted money, ruined evening!","I visited Jim Thompson with my mother and brother to celebrate his promotion. We arrived on time for our 2030hr appointment and were hurriedly shown a table and handed over menus without any greetings or pleasantries. The server asked us our order immediately and we said we needed 5 mins to settle in and look at the menu and we were told that as it was time for the last order, we didn't have time! However the time of the last order was written as 2130 on the premises. No efforts were made to introduce us to anything on the menu and only as an afterthought the waiter told us about an ongoing wine promotion.
As soon as we finished ordering, another waiter came and asked ""you don't want any desserts right?"" Almost expecting us to refuse which we gladly did.
Finally the food was a disaster! Totally tasteless curry and dry overdone tofu and very salty satay. In comparison a meal at the humble Thai accent at vivocity mall was so much nicer and such a pleasant experience.
We don't live in Singapore and wanted to go back to Jim Thompson after a nice evening in our previous trip but never again!"
Good service and ambience,"The ambience and service here is great. Food really depends and it is quite pricey. I like their tom yum soup - yummy with fresh prawns. However, their prawn in the pineapple fried rice is not as fresh. Their green curry taste bad, just full of coconut taste. The vegetables are delicious. The red ruby is not bad but super small bowl. Quite disappointed at how small it is despite the price. Mango sticky rice - some of their mangos are sour! For the price, I think there are better thai food out there."
Perfect !,"First time visitor, so no comparison material ! Very friendly and attentive staff. The restaurant itself is a very nice building high ceilings, with big ass fans, sufficient parking and easy to get a cab. Food and drinks were very tasty ! Yes agree the price is higher than at the hawker but this is not a restaurant for eating only, this is a night out dining experience."
Ambience is great but food leaves much to be desired,"I went to Jim T after 2 years. The ambience and service is still superb. But the food quality is down. The spring rolls were super oily, Corn cakes had no taste. Green curry was so so. and stri fried tofu could do with more basil. It was disappointing. got to find another Thai place i guess."
"Good Food, Ambiance & Good Service",Food was really authentic and very testy. Very efficient services. Wine was also very good. Specially the half bottle option is very appropriate if you happen to drive there.
Lovely ambience & service but food is so-so,"Heard good things so decided to venture there for a birthday dinner. Lovely decor & furnishings, but what’s with the Christmas decorations? It’s March! Food & drink-wise; quite disappointing. Cocktails were $20+ & only so-so. Pandan wrapped chicken seemed like they were microwaved. Twice. They were tough & dry. Prawn cake & spring roll were good. Tom yum soup was not bad. Kang kong was sweet. Red curry with duck: curry was nice, duck dry. Red ruby was ok. Over $300 for 3pax for a so-so meal."
Bad customer experience and suspect of racial discrimination,"Food was great but service was bad. We celebrated our friend’s birthday there and she made reservation there months ago. We were brought to a table where was in the middle of the walkway right in front of the entrance. The waitress specifically said this to us: “we get you a nice table” I was like what? When we asked whether we could move over to other tables such as the ones with the green sofa. The waitress said those were reserved and they have some restriction such as customers could only use it from 6-7:30 (which doesn’t sound right to me). We got to move to another table which was on the side (more private but not sofa seat) and we were okay with it initially . However I later found out those tables with green sofa actually no one is using them .. so I don’t understand why we cannot be moved to those. Anyway, this is a very bad customer experience to me. I am not sure that is due to miscommunication or discrimination.. I hope it is not the later one. Anyway I don’t think I will recommend to anyone about this restaurant or will want to go back to this restaurant again."
Simply excellent,"Outstanding ambiance, great food, presentation, taste. A little pricey but worth it for special occasions."
"Mediocre food, lackluster service","Food was very average for its brand name. Expensive. Service was bad, had to keep asking for water to be refilled. Started chasing everyone out from 930pm, rudely claiming that they closed at 10pm. Totally unexpected from a high class restaurant."
Wonderful !,Ambience was good. Food was tasty and yummy. Staff were efficient and friendly. One of the better restaurants we have dined at. Tks.
one of the best thai food in sg,"Food taste amazing, romantic ambience. we ordered weekend buffet and they had variety of food choices. and the best tom yam soup ever... I would definitely come back this place more often"
Rude staff . A bad experience,Terribly rude staff who rushed everyone out as they wanted to go home . Shocking service . Food was decent but just wouldn’t recommend it given the intimidating staff . Very poor experience and we won’t be back . Such a shame given the location and potential
Good Dining Experience,Took my family for lunch as soon as we could dine in groups of 5. We needed good food & good ambience to de-stress after waves of mini-lockdowns . Couldnt have chosen a better place. Had the set lunch - well presented & good portions . Added the coconut ice cream which was heavenly !
"Not amazing, very average food and very overpriced.","I must say that the hospitality of this supposedly Thai fine dining restaurant is nothing impressive. The food, hospitality does not justify their premium prices. Spent around $200 for 2 pax, ordered a platter (the fried prawn is nothing special), a steamed fish which they did not indicate the price on the menu ($59++), tom yum goong, dessert."
Our experience,"Should improve the service . When we are in need for their service , we kept on waiting for some one in the staff pass from our seats then only we get the chance to request the service we need . Until then no one is attentive to us ."
Wonderful Thai Experience,"We loved the location, the food, the atmosphere and the service at Jim Thompson’s. Can’t wait to go back."
Good Atmosphere but Disappointing Service,"My reservation under Chope was confirmed but when I went to the restaurant, staff said there was no reservation under my name. Also the woman staff who was attending me first was arrogant which was very disappointing. Other staffs were nice and friendly."
Brilliant Thai restaurant,You feel that every dish has been lovingly curated and the food is of the highest quality. Very delicious and traditional royal Thai fare. Love the ambience and the service has always been exceptional.
Quite Disappointing,"We have been going to Jim Thompson for years, but doubt we will again. Food very average and no longer authentic Thai. Food served cold and service inconsistent. Shame really, this used to be the place to go to."
Thai Food in SG setting,Booked a table for 5. Its ambience was soothing. The dishes/servings were well portioned and its taste was authentic. I found the food a tad too salty and found myself quenching my thirst thereafter. It did not pass my 2-hour-taste test though ... Go easy on the sodium.
Great Thai experience,"Authentic Thai restaurante. Great atmosphere , great service and great food. One of the best restaurant in Singapore."
Food,Food was exorbitantly priced and not worth it for the price point. Service could be better too. Portion size was not big either
Amazing Thai dishes !,Excellent Thai restaurant in a beautiful and quiet space. Service is impeccable. Wines are (too) expensive.
Service feedback and food,"I made reservations for my husband's birthday and we had a really nice experience. The staff were really nice and took time to explain the set meals as well as recommend dishes.

I am pregnant and they brought me an extra pillow for my back. They paid attention to the smallest detail.

Overall, we were both very happy with the food and service."
"Great Ambience, Okay Food","I love the location, look and feel of the restaurant. Very private and exclusive. Service was great too. However the food was a tad disappointing. Thankfully prices were decent."
Great Dinner!,"Housed in a large grand colonial style building. It was posh and good for entertaining.
Food was as authentic Thai as we can find in Singapore. It was well prepared. Menu featured traditional and common Thai dishes.
Service was good. Free and convenient parking.
Above average pricing."
Still lousy Thai food!,"After staying away for three years I thought I would try it again. Regrettably, it was poor as it was three years ago."
Expected more,"The best thing about the restaurant is the building which it is in.

Whilst the greeting was friendly, the service thereafter felt very impersonal and rushed. No explanation of dishes given and the name of the game seemed to be to take the order as quickly as possible, even though it was not late or that busy.

The starters were far too large - not normally an issue but in this case it left you feeling full before the main. The prawn cakes were deep fried and very average to say the least - not something you'd expect in a high end Thai restaurant

Green beef curry was tasty as was the mango sticky rice. But overall the experience was not one I would rush back to as there are much better value Thai restaurants in Singapore with better service and ambience."
"Solid, reliable, tasty",Always a reliable experience at Jim Thompson. Service is sharp. Menu is varied. Quality of food delicious. Prices are reasonable.
"Good food, good atmosphere but slightly on the pricy side","Great place for entertaining guests, celebrations . This is definitely aimed at being “ fine thai” . Not the typical simple casual thai eatery. A few thai staff on site making this place rather authentic.food is tasty. , each item averages 20+. Cocktail flavours are surprising. The crab with yellow curry was fabulous. This dish is not easy to find in Singapore and even in thailand . I love it!"
Really strange server that wouldn't stop staring and very clumsy,"We went here for our anniversary and the server was beyond strange. He was just staring at me the hole time. Even when I went to the bathroom to get away from him he was waiting at the door staring at me. It wasn't like he thought I was a celebrity or anything, he was just really odd. He paced back and forth in front of my table just looking me in the eye. I was weirded out completely. Needlessly to say the anniversary dinner was cut short and we went to have a relaxing time elsewhere. The food was not to the standard I thought it would be but I was so scared of the server that I didn't want to say anything. Although the environment looks nice, I would never go back there. The Thai staff I saw were very lovely, it was just this one weird male server. I can't be the first having this problem so I really hope management there does something about it. Even after I told they guy politely if he could stop constantly looking at me he continued to do it. So weird."
As always never a disappointment,Have not been there for awhile but recent return brought back pass experiences and still so good. Great quality and high end food and service . Keep it up!
Set lunch,"Great experience. Staff were attentive and quick to deliver. Well presented, and enjoyable meal. Would go again."
10 for Decor and Ambience. 6 for Food,"First time I dine here was about 10 years ago. This is the second time, and sadly my opinion hasn’t changed.

Interior and decor is the major “wow” factor. Breath taking even if I may add. Service is great, that’s the second “wow” factor. Presentation is glam. After that, the food kind of fell flat.

Maybe it’s not fair to compare to what I have tasted in Thailand. Maybe it’s unfair to judge because the restaurant might not be able to get all the fresh ingredients like in Thailand. Whatever the reasons, despite having all Thai chefs, the food just lacks the “Thai punch”. The heat is there for sure, just lacking something.."
Nice ambience and good tasting Thai food,"Nice ambience and good tasting Thai food. From their fried prawn cake, Pandan chicken, to som tham( mango salad) were tasty. The Tom yum Kung is refreshing, while their green chicken curry and beef paneing were delicious. Their dessert of mango with glutinous rice, boiled yam with coconut milk and Katim Krop were delightful. Service is good and price is on the high end"
Perfect - some things never change,"Brilliant food (Red Curry chicken, Mango salad, green curry) in a fantastic ambience and perfect service. Worth the price every time!"
Upscale Thai food with Thai style ambience.,"Nice premium Thai restaurant with indoor & outdoor seating. You can visit here to shop JIM Thompson items, enjoy Thai dancing, visit Thai style house & have dinner. It is also good for Thais to get upscale quality of Thai food.
Parking is at Holiday Inn hotel, please call the restaurant & there will be shuttle bus service to pick you.
Dress code can be smart casual & booking is required."
Veg Food Haven!,Best Thai vegetarian food in town with a tonne of veg options and a lovely ambience! The restaurant has a stand-alone Vegetarian à la carte menu and set lunch menu! The Veg set lunch was reasonably priced and just fantastic from start to finish. Their service was very warm as well. This is a def must-try if you are in Singapore!
Amazing Authentic Thai food,"So many vegetarian options, we took starters set,we tried yellow curry,olive rice, mango sticky rice"
Costly disappointment,"After reading all the Trip Advisor reviews, we had high expectations for this restaurant. We recently returned from a holiday in Phuket where we enjoyed delicious Thai food, and we were hoping to have a bit of the same in Singapore.

We ordered the spring rolls for appetizer. There were six very small rolls, and it was unmemorable. There is a Singapore chain restaurant that offers a similar dish with more flavor at a fraction the price.

For dinner, my husband had a fried crab curry. It was incredibly heavy dish with limited flavor and did not look appealing to me when it arrived at the table. Upon returning home that night, he complained that his stomach hurt. For dinner, I ordered chicken stir fry. It lacked memorable Thai seasoning, and ""blah"" was the best word to describe it. For an expensive entree, I was surprised that rice was not included, and I needed to order this separately at an additional cost.

For dessert, we tried the dessert sampler, which included two of the restaurant's favorite desserts. Portions were small, and flavors were not memorable.

Overall, the dishes were too expensive for the food quality. We probably will not return despite our love of Thai food."
excellent service and food selection for vegetarians,"had a very pleasant experience at Jim Thompson being my first time together with my family. had a good selection of vegetarian choices with specific requirements without shallots, onions and garlic - not on menu and restaurant is able to cater."
Celebrated 72nd birthday,We ordered the 2 sets as starters. That was very good. Food was delicious and portion was huge too. Plus service was amazing. They sang the birthday song so beautifully. Also the decor was different from usual Singapore restaurants - high ceiling in a fusion colonial & thai style :)
Thai Food at another level,"Great atmosphere, excellent food and matching service!!! An atmosphere of the old Thai, very relaxed atmosphere and a lot of space. Great setting"
Aroi!!!,From the outside of the resto theres already that wow factor ! The interiors of the restaurant completes the overall authentic thai experience . And what can i say about the food ... aroi makmak ( very delicious!!!)
An awesome Sunday lunch treat,"True to expectations the spread and the quality of the food was outstanding - we were a family of four and everyone come away with their favourite - be it the crab cakes, salads, curries and even the a la carte morning glory. Also being my wife birthday celebrations, a message sent along with the reservation was attended - a small band with a birthday song and candle atop a tiramisu slide wa a perfect end to the lunch - the coffee at the end was perfect to end a lazy, late and fantastic lunch - dont miss the mango and rice dessert is the advice for all"
Good ambiance and food,"An elegant seating , quick service, tasty food but pricey. Overall had a good experience of the restaurant."
Nice,"Located at a corner of the city, Jim Thompson lures you with an authentic Thai experience all the way - a Thai dancer walking around, interesting Thai menu and a spacious, well-appointed ambience."
Thai Jim Thompson at Dempsey,Great food staff and ambiance. The Thai dancers circulating around this restaurant provide a very authentic sense of Thailand.
Loaded with MSG monosodium glutamate,"after reading the great reviews we decided to book here for Christmas. We are vegetarian and the vegetarian menu was very impressive, even if it struck us that most if not all of the main dishes were deep fried. Some minutes after ordering and looking at the pictures of the suspiciously glazy food we decided to ask the kind waiter if in case they use MSG please not to cook for us. He went to the kitchen and came back saying sorry the food is ready but there is only MSG in the salt. This statement was absolute BS because there is no salt with MSG!!! It means they do not use salt, but just drench everything in glutamat! My wife only ate the rice, I ate all the rest and had a very hard digestion. We paid the pricey bill including the 10% service charge without being asked about the meal and left. They obviously knew that we knew. Let me remind the readers that MSG is used by lousy cooks who do not believe in their taste and specially by avid business owners who know the truth: glutamat is a very very addictive substance with lab-made chemicals that keeps people coming back.
Our mistake was to accept the dishes and not sending them back to the kitchen. We thank this place for the lesson and hope to make an impact in their integrity."
"Not good as before, deception!!!","Frequent customer to their Sunday Brunch, this time really left frustrated.. Cold food, bad service, no attention, very slow.. not sure will return.."
Pricey but nice,"Excellent service and food. My one complaint is that when we asked to take the leftovers home they did NOT pack the red curry beef - and that costed us $60.00. Would def go back again as the quality and service were good, but would order less and pack my leftovers."
Amazing lunch menu,"We went there by accident and found a fantastic place, with good food and nice service. The set menu for lunch is more than enough and for a reasonable price ( 4 dishes) . Definitely not a cheap one, but you get quality food and elegant atmosphere. We will come back again."
Over rated.,Over rated. The place is nice and service ok. But that’s it. Thai food is basic and expensive for what it is.
Big letdown,"Although there’s nice ambience and decor, there’s much better Thai food in town at more reasonable prices and the service is a letdown. One of our main dishes was served 30 mins after we finished the rest of our meal despite repeated reminders. Despite this, the restaurant insisted that we do not cancel the order and to takeaway if we don’t want to eat. This is unacceptable for a high end restaurant. We also booked a table for 10 for a family meal but were not told it’s a long table hardly conducive for a gathering. Our server was very friendly and helpful, but there’s nothing else commendable here. A big letdown."
Food lacks authentic flavor and staff not helpful either,I was really looking forward to eating my meal at the restaurant coz whenever we are in singapore we loved the food and was a must visit for us. But unfortunately this time it was a terrible Experience because the food quality has also really gone down and lacked the authentic flavors.
Delicious Meal,The menu choice was great and the food was outstanding - in terms of taste as well as presentation. Waiting time was just right.
Always fabulous,"One of my favourite restants, I love Thai food and this restaurant does not dissappoint. Great service too."
Average food for sure,But great service really nice grounds and inside restaurant really upscale it’s just the food as you can see from TA ratings is average. Very high percentage average.
Very good Thai food,"We had a very pleasant dinner at this beautiful restaurant in Singapore. The food was very good and the service was excellent. Our only complaint might be that we were given a table in a side room; it was near the window, which was nice, but it was isolated from the other tables in the main dining section, which would have been more fun (and was a more beautiful room). For most of the meal, we were the only couple in the room. So ask to be in the main room!
I would give this restaurant 4.5 circles if I could."
Really good vegetarian Thai options,So nice to find a Thai place that does really thoughtful vegetarian food. Lots of choices too. Really tasty. Was hoping for some more intense flavors like more of Thai basil garlic or ginger flavors. And a little More spice. But overall very good.
Thai Treasure down the peninsula,"Our friends who had lived in Singapore, told us that this was their favourite Singapore restaurant. We love the Jim Thompson brand, the fabrics and handbags in Thailand, We have also visited Jim Thompson's house twice in Bangkok (1991 and 2012). The experiences have always been magical and this restaurant was no different.

We enjoyed a lovely meal with authentic Thai flavours. Delicious Thai food and a wonderful ambience in a special restaurant away from the busyness of downtown Singapore.

Great decor, great food and lovely staff."
Excellent dining experience.,Beautiful restaurant with a awesome ambience. Live dance and very very good Thai cuisine. It’s a wonderful complete dining experience. Would give my 100% recommendation to have a meal there
Great thai food - lovely setting,"Jim Thompson sits close by to a number of great places to eat (Dempsey Cookhouse, Chop Suey Cafe) and doesn't disappoint.

Set in an old colonial building, with high ceilings, the place has good atmosphere - a nice warm buzz of diners enjoying a curry (or three). We sat in the main dining hall - which has touches of fine dining but doesn't feel stuffy, the general feeling was quite relaxed still.

Went with a number of personal favourite dishes from Thailand - satay chicken and beef skewers to start (sauces were both tasty and fresh), followed by Massaman curry, the meat of which was nicely cooked and tender.

Some decent wine choices (albeit some with eye watering prices, but this is Singapore and Dempsey restaurants always seem to have some pretty high wine prices in my experience!). Service was friendly, though it was busy so staff did go missing every so often.

Overall, one of the best thai meals I have had, not just in Singapore, but around the region too. Will definitely be back."
Elegance is brilliant,"Jim Thompson has the most elegant & beautiful ambience with scrumptious meals that will have you filled up to the brim. They have a dedicated vegetarian menu with meals that will bring a smile to your face.
The staff is friendly and make your experience delightful. It is my go to spot for thai food in Singapore and the olive fried rice & raw mango salad would be on the top of list."
"very nice restaurant , nice location and tasty food","I really love this restaurant , very atmospheric and kind service; The Thai food is also very good and you can chose your "" level"" of spiciness which is very appreciable. It is just a bit too expensive considering the quantities so only for especial occasion."
Simply outstanding,"Outstanding food, service and environment! Jim Thompson is now my favourite restaurant in all of Singapore."
Food is good,"Atmosphere is great! Service is generally good, but we ordered many prawn dishes without realizing, and the waitress did not highlight. Also the seafood Tom yum soup order cake as prawn Tom Yum, although they offered to provide again the seafood Tom yum."
Pricey but it’s really good!,"My second visit. What a wonderful time we had!

I deliberately picked a Monday for celebrating friends’ birthday, so that it was relatively quiet. The staff surprised us with a song and candled dessert for the birthday chaps!

As this is also a bar, their beverage menu was extensive.

The starters are amazing. I know we usually go to restaurants and just eat the soup and main courses but the starters have varied offerings and very good. We got the “golden triangle set” - everything was superb (note that me and this group of friends are fiercely critical diners).

The red curries were yummy. Tom yam was just about rightly sour and spicy. The steamed sea bass in garlic and lime sauce was heavenly - for a person like me who doesn’t like fish, I took several bites of it!! The disappointment was the roast chicken which was hard textured and dry...

As for dessert, the classical mango with glutinous rice and coconut cream dish came with too little mango!! Apart from that, all else was great.

Oh, there is a up-close performance of traditional Thai dance during our meal. Nice touch!"
"Great location, ambience and service with steep pricing but food quality is nothing extraordinary","Beautiful location, old colonial house in a calm quiet hood, great ambience- but it was very disappointing to see how the food quality and taste has faded over the years. Try the soups, that's the only thing which still tastes great."
Sunday Brunch: Amazing Good,"Back after more than a year and Quality, service and Taste keep at the highest level.. All of you can eat of delicious Thai food!!"
"A Vegetarian, A Pescatarian, A Big Eater! All satisfied!",Been here many many times! Always end up ordering too much but super satisfied! Love the betel leaves!
Great location. Ordinary food.,"Located in an interesting colonial building near the botanical gardens, the decor is quality Royal Thai.

But that is where it ends. The dishes themselves, while well presented, were insipid in flavour and frequently poorly cooked. Overdone “crying tiger” impossible to eat, laab that is meant to be highly spiced but was extremely bland.

Jim Thompson restaurants do cater to a western palette in terms of spiciness, but it still needs to be much better than this."
Incredible food and ambiance,"Incredible food and classy ambiance. Superb service but pricey menu. One of the rare Thai dinnings in Singapore. Location wise, hidden gem and needs a car to access. Definitely need reservations."
"Nice ambience, average food","Went back there for lunch with some friends. This has been our go-to restaurant for anniversary and birthday dinners, but over the years the food quality has gone down. On this occasion, we ordered some appetizers (pandan chicken and golden triangle set), and some mains (veg pad thai, stir-fried fish, and some fried rice) followed by dessert. While the appetizers were great, the mains were anything but. We had to send back the pad thai, as it was watery, sweet and noodles were chewy. Surprising that a specialty Thai restaurant can not produce decent pad thai. Rest of the mains were nothing to write home about, and neither were the dessert. All in all a average experience, even though the ambience is, as always, great. Guess need to start looking for another go-to restaurant, eh!"
THAI FOOD EXPERIENCE,"PROs
- Beautiful traditional decor and environment
- Staff was friendly and prompt
- Standard Thai dishes were delicious
- Good for business, family, group and couples.

CONs
- None I can think of

SUMMARY
- We had a business dinner for 13 people here and early arrivals waited in the outdoor waiting area and ordered/served drinks. Outdoor dining is also available and pleasant in the evening. Our servers were friendly and prompt and the food was served quickly and fresh. Overall a great environment, ambiance and nice experience. We will definitely return."
lunch w/ friends,"best the scenery much more traditional Thai. Design on Bar is brilliant, love the crystal. Dancer beautiful! The location is great."
Beautiful setting and good food,"We came as a family of 5 and dined here during our vacation. Their menu is quite extensive and it was hard to decide what to eat. Finally we agreed on chicken satay, pad Thai and beef stir fry. All the dishes were good but didn't offer anything unique or something I had not had before. The restaurant itself is gorgeous with beautiful decor. It is right opposite the Singapore botanical gardens in case you wanted a bite to eat after strolling through the gardens. But don't show up in your workout clothes."
Good meal,"The building is beautiful and the interior design really nice too. Authentic artifacts, pieces of furniture et definitely contribute to a nice atmosphere.
The service was good, courteous and efficient, from the welcome to the bill.
Rich à la carte selection of Thai dishes, all very tempting.
The green mango salad was great indeed: chilli, lime and all the fragrances and savors that transport you to Thailand in a bite.
But then came the mains, and both the chicken and the beef were average. As much as we got the true Thai kick when enjoying the appetizers, we were not that impressed by the mains.
Nice selection of beers and wines, by the glass and bottles too of course.
Pricing is very high: beware almost every single dish is between $20 and $30+.
For instance, for the sweets it is SGD23.00 for a mango sticky rice which consists of a small scoop of rice along with a slice of mango: although very good, it is somehow outrageous.
At the end, with drinks, expect a minimum of $100per head."
Good Thai food and ambience,"Jim Thompson is a good option for a change from restaurants in the CBD or Marina Bay. Only 15 mins by taxi from CBD, offers large menu and great Thai food. Building has good ambience, with a pair of Thai dancers floating around for that extra touch. Definately casual and very relaxed - plenty of families there when I dined with friends on a Wednesday evening."
"Good food, service needs to improve","The atmosphere is nice, the place is big, and there are two Thai ladies welcome you. The menu is rich but quite expensive. The service is sure needs to improve. That was one dish that once ordered and served looks very different. One of my friends who order it, ask to replace. The waiter just say no. We ask to speak with the chef or the management and got ""cannot"". We end up not touching the dish, and order a new one.
A place that respect himself and his guests should be more pleasant, especially in a fine restaurant. Food issues = should be a chef or a management concern. Here they just don't care about how was your experience.
We will not come back."
Very atmospheric building,A superbly atmospheric restaurant; colonial building and great staff. The food was good - but not terribly memorable - so go for atmosphere as opposed to a historic meal
"Gorgeous ambience, delicious food","We ordered tom yum soup, steamed fish, a set appetizer platter and everything was mouthwatering. The highlight was the delicious coconut icecream served inside a real coconut! The only downside was that while the food was great, it did not leave us with the feeling that the food was anything unique or special. It was definitely above average but the that came more from the quality of ingredients than from a blend of unique flavours."
Good thai food,"If you want to eat high class Thai food in a very cool environment, this is the place for you. It doesn’t have the best Thai food in Singapore but the food is still amazing. The prices are steep but everything is amazing."
BEAUTIFUL TIME,"As usaual we g=had a beautiful time at Jim Thompson. food is perfect, the place is gorgeous and the atmosphere very nice."
A wonderful restaurant,My second visit to Singapore and my second visit to Jim Thompson restaurant Both visits have been fantastic The staff are extremely helpful and accommodating The food is beautifully presented and tastes delicious. There is something for everyone on the menu
Beautiful place,"Not the cheapest thai food around but definitely top quality in terms of decor, ambiance and service."
Sunday Buffet,"High ceiling and long Thai restaurant, cosy decor. Sunday lunch had a buffet spread for 68$ with drinks except alcohol, 98$ including. Very good spread of food from appetisers, salads to mains and desserts. Their satay, Kao tang na tang, prawn paste ball, som tam, yum neau were all great tasting. The mains from green curry, masamman curry, fried snapper, morning glory were all great tasting. Mango with sticky rice, cassava cakes were all wonderful desserts. Worth its value and taste."
Short changed and taken for a ride.,I go to this place frequently. Food and the ambience is great. But in the last hew visits I got the impression that I am being short changed for liquor. Yesterday I.e 15 th March I ordered double rum( 60 Ml). I asked the waiter if it’s 60 ml. He called the bartender who confirmed its 60 ml. Then I asked him to get the measure. It was only 35 ml. I don’t expect a reputed restaurant like Jim Thompson to short change and take advantage of gullible customers.
A great variety of Thai food,We enjoyed this restaurant for its variety of food to fit many palates. A little noisy as it has good attendance. Had to work some to catch server's attention to pay bill.
Great ambiance that comes with an expensive price tag!,"Nestled within Dempsey Hill, this restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating. Due to our last minute booking, we had to sit outside. I was worried about mosquitoes/ bugs at first, but it wasn't an issue at all. It turned out to be a beautiful night with a very comfortable breeze, and dining under stars couldn't be lovelier!

The menu is extensive, from cocktails to food. For a party of 4, we really struggled agreeing on which dishes to get cause everything looked so good! The food is delicious, but it's also on the expensive side as far as Thai cuisine goes. I suppose that it was a special occasion, and when you factor in the ambiance, it's not too bad for value."
