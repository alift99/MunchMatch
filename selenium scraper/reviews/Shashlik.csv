Good Food Good Service,Have been dining at Shaslik with the family for a very long time. Standard of food is still the same. Servers are polite and friendly. Good ambience too.
Heart and soul,"I am not a person who goes out at all. I am grumpy and I think that apart from doing my taxes, dining out is the second most tiresome thing to do.

Shashlik is the only place with table service that I will show up at. Food is great but it is the heart and soul that makes me go back.

I had my doubts to be honest, since it renovated a while back. But then I arrived with my friend from out of town and immediately felt the spirit of the place.

Never change. Thank you."
Dinner,"Food was average, wasn’t as good as it used to be. It’s quite expensive so it’s not value for money. Can definitely get better quality elsewhere"
Hidden surprise,Tucked away in a little explored corner of Orchard Rd. Delicious food at affordable prices served by a friendly and efficient team.
Overall experience @ Shashlik,The food was pretty delectable with the upsized borsch soup compared to decades ago as well as the succulent and tender Blue Fire Ribs marinated with the signature Ah Kor sauce. Dining atmosphere is kinda modern with house music being played.
Cozy restaurant and great food,"This is my second time eating at this restaurant. Overall the food were lovely and delicious. My whole family love it. We ordered Upsidedown Crab, Stuffed Portabello Mushroom, Iberico Pork, Ribeye Steak, Russian coffee, Borshch soup and Banana Flame (I find this dish is too pricey and nothing special, S$28 for 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and fried banana in brandy). The rest was fantastic!"
Shashlik Restaurant Not Good As Before,"Borsch soup was different from the Borsch soup in the past and did not taste as good too. Overall, the standard of the food has dropped now."
As good as always,Staff were friendly and welcoming everytime I came to the restaurant and were very considered in choosing nice tables for me. Food was always good as usual! :)
Cosy place for Great Food.,"You wont be disappointed with friendly staff and great food. Must have, soup! Oxtail Stew and Blue fire ribs and finished off with Russian coffee!"
An Old Shanghai Western in Singapore,"I am from Shanghai and I was introduced to this hidden gem by my relatives living in Singapore.

This restaurant reminds me of the yesteryear of Shanghai where chinese and western cultures created unique flavors that were signatures of the era.

I was really surprised to learn that Shashlik Restaurant had their roots to the Troika Restaurant which was founded by a Shanghainese migrant in 1963!

It is truly remarkable that such a cultural heritage has continued to exist outside Shanghai and of all places, in an obscure mall in Singapore!

I loved their Borshch , Beef Shashlik, Oxtail Stew and most of all the Baked Alaska which made the visit so memorable. The super soft Bread Rolls were superb and I could not resists going for 3 of them!

The service and ambience were excellent which complete the great dinning experience.

I will definitely be back for more!"
"Way overpriced, mediocre food.",Went for my sons’ birthdays plus it was nostalgic for my mom. We were superbly underwhelmed by the mediocre food. The beef was tough & my husband cooks a better steak. Everything was overpriced. Only good thing was that the staff were nice. Will not go again!
Above average,"Second visit, the fish en papillote was above average, fish was fresh but the sauce a bit sour unlike the first visit which tasted really good.
The mushroom soup was good.
The bread was really good, soft and fluffy, I ordered another six additional pieces at SGD0.5 each.
Main reason coming here to try the fish and bun again.
Ambience okay and normal customer service."
"Good food, good service","Good service, delicious food, nice environment. Ordered borscht, beef shashlik and baked alaska. Will definitely be back if given the chance."
Authentic Russian vibe,"Delicious food and friendly staff! It was my fist Russian cuisine experience, really have to say it was a great dinner."
Cute venue. Food rather bland,"We walked over from our hotel to have dinner one evening here. The restaurant is a little difficult to find, on the top floor of an old-styled shopping building.

The decor was well done and service was okay. The food was just mediocre though. We both agreed we probably would not return. It was not bad! Just nothing special either."
Wonderful dinner,Been to Shaslik for over 20 years. Always so looking forward to our next dinner. Alan and his staff are always making it so warm and lovely for us to dine there. Thank you all ❤️
"Good food, great service and relaxing ambience",Service was very prompt. Our queries were clearly attended to. We had two set lunches and enjoyed all aspect of the lunch. Will be beck on one Wed for the Oxtail stew.
Deposit,We had a bad experience. In my life 1st time I need to place deposit of $30 per person and we had 8 pax a total of $240 deposit was needed.this $240 was not allowed to deduct from the bill on the very day.and they will continue to hold the $240 for a minimum of 5 days up tob14 days to get the refund.we were so annoyed when my friend tried to book for the same restaurant and they never ask for deposit. Can you let me know what is this all about?I demand for a refund of $240 asap
food is very taste and nice,"Overall the service , atmosphere and food standard is good. Special the dessert is very nice .we will go again"
Room for improvement,Nice to be back again after the pandemic and was very pleased with the new interior deco. The new interior somehow transports me away from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road. Overall dinner experience was good but would be better if the restaurant can offer more than 1 bread roll throughout thew dinner; soup to be hotter instead of Luke warm; and the server to be trained on timing to extinguish the flame from the baked Alaska. The baked Alaska I ordered had the cream burnt because the flame was left burning for too long.
Brough back the good ole days,"Have not visited this place for a while, did bring back memories of the good ole days when I use to visit this place so regularly.
The ambience was great and the service as well.
The food was even better.
The borsch soup was awesome as usual.
There were 5 of us we all ordered it.........."
Pleasant Evening,"Enjoyed the evening. It was my special day and I was with family. The ambience, service and warmth pf the service staff made it memorable. Thanks!"
Pleasant Dinning Experience,"Birthday dinning with my family. Great service, great good. Warmth & cozy ambience. Personally like the dinning chair."
Old School Experience,"Took old classmates and we all enjoyed the Hainanese style pork chop with fried chicken rice balls. It was served with Worcester Sauce and chicken rice style chilli. An interesting and well prepared dish. Together with the warm soft bread and borsh soup, we all enjoyed the meal"
Good Ambience and Service,Very prompt and attentive service. The medium steak may not be as good as other premium places but it is value for money.
Localised Taste,"As it is not a friend gathering, i do expect the wait staff to be more sensitive in the approach to the guests, we have been interrupted many times by them in the course of 1 hr to ask us if they can clear the plates and if we can quick finished our food."
Will visit again!,Went to eat my all time favourite borsch soup and shashlik beef. Had it as medium rare and the beef was very tender and juicy. Tried their bone marrow and escargot are so delicious.
It was ok,"Had always been a regular customer even before the owner took over. Big fan of their dessert Baked alaska but the standard had dropped. The ice cream was super frozen and it does not taste as good as it used to be. On my last visit, there was a insect that flew to my table and when I told the service staff, she in return asked me what was it? They just grabbed it away and did not do much about it after that. Ordered rare steak but it came out medium well...but they were very nice and changed a new one for us.
Overall, standard had dropped...or should I say standard is inconsistent."
Service was superb,The service crews were very friendly and nice. Their hot bun were really nice and we ordered a second serving to dip on the escargot sauce! Tenderloin beef was tough though. Overall the experience was good!
Warm reception,Hosted a big group size luncheon for my wedding reception. Pre arranged with the restaurant and they made effort to set the table and the staff were very friendly with a warm homely feel for everyone.
Disaapointing food,"Being one of the few restaurants that serve Russion food in Singapore, the quality is disappointing. Chicken a la Kiev is bland, blinis caviar the flavor of caviar overpowered by cream and crepe. Only borscht is ok but nowhere near impressive."
Dining experience,I am disappointed with both the service and food quality. The elderly waiter who served us bread dropped it on my soup which splashed onto me. He just brought me 2 more serviettes without apology nor replacing with a new bread. I had to ask another waitress. The ribs was mediocre. The meat is tasteless and dry. The bosch soup do not taste like before in the earlier days. Something is missing. The bomb Alaska was very burnt and charred which the waiter still serve us without due regard. For the price we pay I would expect better food and service. This will be the last time we will dine in this restaurant.
Disappointing,"Standard of food has fallen. We had Borsch soup( not much vegetables, tasted dilute, not tangy), Chateaubriand steak was disappointing. Ribs were so so. Service was excellent but we won’t be coming back."
Great place to bring your friends,"Sashlik is the place to bring friends, especially visitors from abroad, as it has history (founded 1986 but going back to the early 60s if you consider its predecessor Troika) and great food that is unusual and instagrammable. I visited several times over the years and the food has never disappointed.
The highlights must be the Bomb Alaska and other flambe desserts though the beef shashlik, chicken Kiev, bread rolls and Russian coffee are pretty good too"
Good restaurants,"After more than ten years never been there, the food quality still there, service for sure better than those years, happy to go again, thanks"
Food quality,The service is good and staff is attentive and quick to response. The only thing is that food quality was a little disappointed for the ribs (little dry) and tenderloin steak was not as tender as the name described. ordered 300g and it came as like a chunk of meat. Texture not as tender. Shashilik beef still alright and thanks for the dessert that rounded with some encouragement.
Nostalgic,Shashlik has been around for the longest time and the standard of the food remains as good. The old school look of the restaurant makes it homey and classic.
"Nice ambient, great food",This is a nice old school western restaurant that still serves your flaming steak and desserts. Great nice food and great service. A bit noisy for my liking though.
Good food and service,The waiter recommended the appropriate number of dishes for our group. Food was delicious! Good service. Will go there again!
Food and service were below expectations,The Borsche soup was not as good as it used to be. And the ribeye steak was tasteless and hard even though I ordered medium. Service was below expectations too. Will not patronize again.
Missing the taste of the Old Shashlik,"Oxtail stew and the soups was excellent.

The baked alaska was a let down. It was very different from how the old shashlik chefs did it. The present version is essentially a swenson-style premade frozen cake with piped meringue. The original baked shashlik baked alaska used to be actual scoops of ice cream padded with sponge cake and pipped meringue, and then baked in a hot oven before being served over litted rum. This technique and taste has been lost.

Lamp chops were tough and gamey. Chicken a la kiev was dry and too thick to enjoy thoroughly.

Old taste of shashlik is very much missing."
Room for improvement,"The beef dishes were excellent however chicken and fish dishes is a bit disappointing. The chicken breast was a bit dry, and fish was too over powered by the tomato sauce."
Shashlik Beef,"Food quality has deteriorated a little. However the price has gone up. They have done a good job renovating & sprucing up the restaurant, clean and nice."
Disappointed,"We ordered the Hainanese pork chop rice and fish and chip set lunch. The pork chop has lots of fats and difficult to chew plus oily too. The fish and chips, very disappointed. Only 2 small pieces. Not worth the price. Never want to go back again."
For good old days,Used to be my family fave restaurant. Missed it during covid 19 pandemic. Taste wise not like before. Acceptable standards. Came more for nostalgia. Ambience has improved. Pricing high & no promotions at all.
Food presentation,I had Shashlik of Iberico Pork. The presentation of the food is very unappetizing with the meat served on the hot plate. It will be more presentable if it is served with coloured pepper in between the meat. I like the Baked Alaska though.
Excellent old school food and atmosphere.,"Excellent atmosphere and service. Food is delicious too. We had the egg millionaire for starters, beef Shashlik, mushroom delight and beef stroganoff; along with the baked Alaska."
Price on the high side but food is excellent,"Be prepared to pay a high price but food was really good. Mushroom soup was full of shredded mushroom, not simply water, starch and flavouring. The Blue Fire Ribs is a must-try."
Food standards have dropped,"We used to go to Shaslik quite often about 10-15 years ago. We have since left Singapore & this is our first time back. The Borsch soup was terrible, it was extremely dark & incredibly salty. I told the server this and got a ""is it?"" as a response. My wife had the lamb & it was tasteless. At the end of the meal, the server cleared our table by throwing the used butter into the soup bowl. I would expect better from a restaurant that prides itself on serving VIPs. The only saving grace is we went on a weekday & the dining atmosphere was rather serene."
Great food and impeccable service,Ordered my usual favourites like Borsch soup and shashlik of beef. Tasted as great as usual. My family enjoyed the pork ribs and baked Alaska too. It will be good if they bring back some of the old seafood dishes.
Tried and True!,"I enjoy dining at Shashlik for the lovely ambience, well-prepared food, excellent service. The table service ""flambe"" desserts are always a hit - visually and taste-wise. Cherries jubilee and crepe suzette are the perfect ending to a meaty-meal!"
Nice surprise,Location of place is so so but ambiance is very nice . I like good and staff seems very friendly . I like they look after my friends baby throughout. Pretty unique food service for Singapore. Fair prices . I like to back there again .
Iconic restaurant for acquired tastes,"An iconic Russian themed steak restaurant which would mostly appeal to older generations. We had stew, steak and famed flaming dessert. Staff was very nice and responsive but the food just seemed bland. Perhaps that’s what this food is all about but it wasn’t anything special inspiring you to go back. That said, the tables around us seemed to be having a wonderful meal. So I would regard this as food and atmosphere for acquired tastes. Read other reviews to see if it’s for you."
Excellent Food & Service,Revisiting Shashlik after nearly 4 decades brought back many good memories. The quality of the food and great service has remained the same. Will be back again soon and not another decade or so.
Legendary disappointment,"Ordered borsch, onion soup & escargots - I must say the starting was good. tasty. prompt serving
Ordered Beef Shashlik, RibEye, Sirloin - Disappointed. The Shashlik were pricy, dry, overcooked for medium. Small portion. The RibEye is a better comparatively in term of size, value for money and taste. Sirloin medium tasted like a big rock. Dry too.
As the portions left us hungry, we order Blue Fire Ribs... which I must said should have been our order to avoid the legendary disppointment which came with order steak ordersss.
Service is really poor... the older generation waiters do not care a damn. Avoided us even though we put up hands.
To leave with a legendary experience and memory, we decided to finish off with Alaska... it was good to end the dinner with it but I left felt cheated to have ordered the legendary shaslinks. My 3 sons said they will not come back again.... and it left me wonder if Shashlik will ever last another generation.... sad :("
Once off experience to fulfill curiosity,Saw my local friend posting a good review on this restaurant on his FB. The experience is very opposite to what was portrayed. The beef skewer was dry and unjuicy. Overrated restaurant with ridiculous price tags. Only the complimentary bread was good.
Something new and good,"First visit and first time eating Russian food. The bread was really good, soft and fluffy. The chicken a la kiev was okay but a bit chewy. The fish en papillotte was fresh and good. The baked Alaska was above average, the smaller option should be enough for 3 people.
Normal customer service, the place is dimly lit and sometimes a bit difficult to get the attention of the service staff."
Family time always especial,The food is as good but I was expecting probably a bit more and more Russian style. Maybe I didn’t understand the information enough. But was ok
Classic like no other!,"Been going since the 90s but first time in awhile. Firstly, nothing beats the taste of nostalgia. But secondly, even as a new visitor it's great russian-hainanese fare (chicken kyev, beef goulash with chicken rice!) at decent prices. Sounds weird but it's high-end comfort food? And if you have kids make sure you get a bomb Alaska for dessert, it's a spectacle!"
Old world charm,"After hearing about the legendary ox-tail stew, made reservations for 12 noon on Wednesday. It lived up to its reputation, tender and flavorsome off the bone in a delicious brown sauce with chunks of broccoli and half a boiled potato, all cooked to perfection.
We chose the mushroom soup which was thick and full-bodied. Next time shall ask for it really hot as it was lukewarm. The soft bread that comes with butter was good for sopping up the oxtail gravy. Coffee was old-fashioned Hainanese black coffee with evaporated milk on the side, wonderfully nostalgic of coffee houses in the 70s. Indeed a great part of the enjoyment of dining here is the retro atmosphere of the starched yellow table-cloths and the vintage flavor not only of the restaurant but the whole Far East Shopping Centre building with its antiquated single- person escalators, one characteristically in need of repair .
For old times' sake ordered the Baked Alaska, sinfully gorgeous in meringue. Thoroughly enjoyable.
The service is impeccable. Quick, kind, considerate, old- world charm at its best."
Friday night dinner with family,"My kind of family dinner,excellent dinner,delicious food and the amazing staff thank you ,we will be back for sure"
Birthday Dinner at Shashlik,"We celebrated my gf birthday over at Shashlik as we wanted to relive our childhood experiences at Shashlik while we were much younger.
We ordered the dishes that we had grown so familiar with, the escargot, Borsch soup and full stack ribs and ended off with the Alaskan cake.
As it was the gf birthday, the service staff were very accommodating to assist us with many photos and candles on the cake and even a birthday song!

Gf was really happy with the memorable experience. When the gf is happy, the guy has done a good job. When both are happy patrons, the restaurant staff has done a great job!

Thank you to all the staff at Shashlik for making it an awesome dining experience for us!"
Lovely restaurant,"Great service and super tasty food! The highlight of the meal is how they give the finishing touch to desserts and drinks beside your table, we really enjoyed the “performance”. Will definitely visit again!"
Great Restaurant!,Good food and ambience. The excellent service helped make it an enjoyable and complete dining experience. Will be back again!
Old times' sake,Been a long time since I've been here. Happy to see the food has stayed good. Wine list was also good.
Same nostalgic feel,Live the ambience and I must say the service has improved! Thank you for the great experience! Loved the Borsch soup and loved the Baked Alaska!
Shashlik Restaurant,"The atmosphere and interior designing of the place was nice, a very relaxed and sultry vibe.
Service was generally alright, waiters were attentive and helpful with providing suggestions and advice however, they kept speaking in Mandarin to us despite our replies in English which I felt was a little strange- Not a big issue. Food wise, was a let down, unfortunately. We ordered the Borscht soup, that was decent, wasn’t splendid. There was only one piece of beef in it and the rest were vegetables. Next we had the Blue fire ribs which was dry and rough. Flavor wise, was decent, tasty but not flavorful enough.
The Shashlik beef, that was the least favorable out of the three, for something that’s marinated for 36 hours, it was awfully blend.
The presentations of both mains were interesting regardless of its tastes.
Overall, the price paid was not on par with the quality in our opinion"
Service can be improved,"We sat almost 10mins, no one serve us bread nor taking order until I finally got someone attention.
The bread was very soft and fluffy, so nice I asked for another extra piece, however I only know it’s chargeble when I see the bill! The butter too! It’s would be good if someone tell us when we asked for the extra portion as almost all the restaurants don’t charge extra for complimentary breads and butter.
The food is ok, lamb rack was good but ribs a bit too dry though.
Borscht soup was lukewarm. Onion soup was good.
Maybe not going back again as it’s not what I actually anticipated.
It’s full house so booking is a must."
Good ambience,"A good setting for a meal. Tables lined with yellow table cloth brightens up the place. Good service was given with a lady waitress giving good advice on desserts. However, the menu can be improved with greater variety and more reasonable pricing."
Nice family restaurant,Food is tasty. Service is good. We enjoy the dining experience. The food portion is adequate. We will go again.
need to check price before heading over,the xmas festive booking was easy. however the menu was limited due the festive. same dish but 20% higher. generally food is decent and environment is still classic. not the best time to visit during holiday festive for sure
Excellent Christmas dinner at Shaslik,"We chose Shaslik as it was one of the few restaurants that doesn't have a fixed festive menu.
This is one of those restaurants that we keep returning on special days; mostly due to the quality of food. The atmosphere has improved quite a bit since the guys had a make over 2-3 years back.
We are completely satisfied with the Shaslik of Beef and Ribs + appetizers."
Tasty food and Nice ambience,It was a Xmas meal with family. The Shashlik steak was nicely done and Irish coffee was great! This is my 3rd time to visit this restaurant.
Family lunch celebrating Daddy's 60th Birthday,"Our family first visit to Shashlik. It was recommended by a friend. The restaurant is nice with classic ambience. We love the steaks, shashlik beef and onion soup. The baked Alaska is just perfect for birthday."
Lunch,Had pork chop and beef tenderloin for lunch. Have to differ from other writers’ comments. Soups were lukewarm. The rolls were good.
Borscht Soup,That's the item in the menu that leads me back to the restaurant and of course not to leave out the Shaslik and Oxtail Stew.
No english spoken?,Food was good. Service staff polite but friend commented why is only Mandarin spoken when its a Russian Restaurant
Still the best,"Been there twice, loved it both times. The blend of atmosphere, staff and food makes this place my new first choice. I wish this place nothing but the best!"
Great service and food,"Especially loved the beef shashlik. The American guests we invited were impressed with the food, they had not known such a place existed near their hotel."
Excellent Service!,"Staff was attentive to needs and attended to requests promptly. Appreciate the photo moments offered by staff when we had the Baked Alaskan dessert, and it was yummy."
Happy customer,"Love the new menu, food is excellent and we loved the crepes which is a must everytime we dine with you all. Atmosphere has also improved, more refreshing."
Delicious food and great service,Still the same delicious food and great service. Only thing is price has increased though understandable cos of COVID.
"Good food, nice ambience","Food was good. Had the lamb, meat was juicy and not too tough. Excellent service provided by staff as well who knew we were celebrating a birthday."
One of the best restaurants,Hidden gem. First time to the restaurant. Impressed with the food quality and taste. Staff are very friendly and knowledgeable about customer needs. Wine selections good as well.It was my friends birthday dinner and we enjoyed our dinner and drinks.
Good food. Good service,"Shahslik food and service is great. We have been there a few times and it’s pretty nice every time. The atmosphere is nice , people are kind and caring and the food is unique and tasty. One of our fav places in SG."
Good service!,"Been there a couple of times over the last 10 years. To be honest, I think the food standard dropped a little and seemed a little overpriced now. But the service is much better now and kind of makes up for it.

The restaurant can look into adjusting the price a little, do more promotions, or tie up with some credit cards for discounts. It will definitely attract more people to come back.

I had a good time there celebrating my friend's birthday. Thanks team and keep the smile!"
Reminiscence Good Old Days,"Haven't been to Shaslik for a long time. So, I enjoyed my meal thoroughly. It was my first time trying the Chicken Ala Kiev, I would say it was good and succulent, but I felt the fries was a bit too heavy to finish. I guess my taste bud has changed so I felt the Bomb Alaska was a bit too sweet for me. Good for lunch or dinner. Will go again one day."
You can never go wrong with Shashlik,"The food was awesome and service was impeccable. My favorite steak - sirloin with fried garlic topping, is wonderfully paired with a bottle of red. The flavorful oxtail stew was tender & fell off the bone. Our borsch soup, bone marrow, and of course the Bombe Alaska were amazing too."
Good food as always,"Pleasant evening with consistently good food. The borsch and onion soups were satisfying and the rack of lamb and slab of ribs, done right and moist. With a bottle of red wine, you can’t go wrong here!"
Weekday set lunch,Only order from the a la carte menu. The only thing decent on the set lunch menu is the borscht soup and oxtail stew. The salad that came with the rubbery and tough Hainanese pork chop was half wilted and should not have been served.
Go to place for great food,Food is always great. Genuine warm service from the staff. Go check out the history wall at the back.
Dinner at Shashlick,"The ribs, beef and baked Alaska still damn good. The borsch soup was darker than usual and tasted bitter."
Food standard deteriorated as well as service standard.,"Had my usual signature dish that I had 3 months ago. It was Saturday lunch time with handful of customers. Meat was fiber & sauce felt like from leftover. When asked for return of credit card after a long wait & no cashier in sight at till, staff ran after customer who just left. Must had thought they had given back to wrong customer. Fortunately, another staff spotted my bill & card that were left unattended. It is such pity this has to happen!"
How come there was no chope points issued & no reservation marked as attended? Pls investigate and acknowledge reply,How come I did not see my reservation in chope and that I had attended as confirmed by Shashlik Restaurant staff cum Mgr Derrick and there was no 150 chope points issue ?
Wonderful staff and delicious food!,Everything is good. Wonderful service rendered by the entire staff and the food is awesome too. Will come back here for the Irish coffee again hopefully with the same person.
Good services,I enjoy the food so much. Services are well served with perfect set up for dinning. I will return with my family members when the nos of person to dine is increased.
Not same before,"I come here when i little kid with family, was very savoury, service super, different before but ok."
"It’s not like it used to be, very disappointed",The beef served was very thick just like a big slab of meat and was not tender making it very difficult to cut into smaller pieces. The sauce was a bit bland and not tasty like before. The broccoli were served in very big chunks which feel there is very effort or pride put in by kitchen staff before serving. The Borsh Soup of yesteryear were definitely much better. Unlikely I will dine here again.
Hidden gem in Far East shop’g centre,"We love the ambience. Serviced by mostly old workers. They are friendly and professional. The soups and beef stroganoff are nice. We tried the ribs, it is quite disappointing. Will go for the steak next time."
"Good food, great service","Food was still as good but service has improved so much from 3 years ago when I was there. Staffs are very attentive, friendly. Definitely value for money!"
