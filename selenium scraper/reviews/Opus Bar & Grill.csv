Great service and very family friendly,Good char on the steak. Extremely reasonable prices. Great starters. Excellent service and friendly staff.
Poor Service on Christmas day,"Understandably, the restaurant hired a few part timers to boost manpower during the holidays. But the people they hired were poorly trained. Asked for sparkling water and was directed to the table with drinks which only had plain water. Asked again and took so long and came back to tell me that it was chargeable, of course I expected it to be charged, still no sparkling water. I had to go to the hostess, told her of my request. Also asked for cocktail menu.....took forever and servers unsure not knowing what to do is infuriating to watch. The clincher came when we were trying to take a selfie and the server KEPT ASKING if she can clear our plates, we were obviously not replying coz we were holding our smiles and waiting for the camera to click. She stood there and KEPT ASKING. Like seriously.....Food was OK, but terribly bad service on a special occasion. Definitely not worth the money we paid. Never coming back here again."
Ok experience. Would give another shot :),"The feel we got when we entered the restaurant was pretty good. Service was attentive and very professional. They carried themselves very well.

The food on the other hand was pretty average. The focaccia was below sub-par. It made it worst that it was served with pretty good butter. Maybe a nice extra virgin olive oil would have done better. The bread was also pretty flavourless.

Crab cake was well done with good amount of crab in it. The seasoning was slightly salty and sauce could have been more.

We got the salmon main and a shanchoku strip. The salmon was delightful albeit the skin was a little too charred. The steak was at the right doneness, and was of pretty good quality, however it was also too heavy on the charred flavour that it was borderline overly bitter. The sauce, wild mushroom and truffle was unpleasant and did nothing to elevate the steak.

We ordered a side of pomme pur√©e, it was slightly grainy, and also was lacking in that pleasant butter taste that you should get. It also felt like it was unsalted or maybe just under seasoned.

Overall we will give it another try as I think the concept of using charcoal cooking is pretty cool."
Bad quality steak experience,"Bad steak experience I had , with the full blood of tomahawk and bitter taste of foie gras(over seal)
I had try compare under Hilton and IHG group, that was not worth of me spending $460 for a dinner with this quality"
One of the best Buffet spread!,"Our first one at the restaurant and trying their Sunday Brunch buffet and the experience was simply awesome!

From the excellent spread (eg French food station, grilled whole fish) great tasting food and attentive service, it was the perfect place for Sunday Brunch with the family to celebrate my son‚Äôs birthday."
Beautiful GF Dinner,"We had a beautifully cooked lobster and Wagyu steak that was all gluten free, which can be hard to come by in Singapore. The sous chef came and greeted us and helped us after I mentioned I was coeliac. We had a lovely night, my husband ordered a beautiful desert that wasn‚Äôt gluten free, (I was fine without having desert) the sous chef brought me out a fruit salad so I wouldn‚Äôt feel left out.
I would highly recommend this restaurant. Oysters were amazing and fresh also.
Their Singapore slings were very good also."
Great Sunday Brunch with family,"Had an excellent visit, taking family who were visiting from the UK.

Every part was amazing, could not fault any of the food and the staff service was great. Special mention to Chua who really looked after us and to Eddie who kept checking up on us to make sure all was good."
Another wonderful meal with fantastic service,We have now been here MANY times and they never fail to provide exceptional service and food. Our go-to place for celebrations.
Birthday Dinner,"Great food and service by Manager Alvin! The premises are clean, the atmosphere is cosy, Will recommend to friends."
Dinner,Tomahawk was good. Manager Alvin was great in his service. Ambient is great. is a great place to hang out.
Wonderfully warming time,"Oyster is outstanding delicious - my choice of shoyu sauce is perfectly just right. Seafood platter is nice and also comes with free-flow wine only costs 20 Singapore dollars. Besides, this is very romantic place and so warming service. Very Impressed üòä"
Great Friday night!,"Service was slightly slow, but food was good overall. Had a free cake for my boyfriends birthday too!"
A wonderful birthday celebration!,"Went to this bar to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday, ordered the striploin and lobster combo, and beetroot salad. Which were excellent, the beef is very tender and busting with flavors, the lobster is nicely done without over cooked, juicy and tasty. Patricia who is serving our table was very helpful and took a lot of pictures for us. We really appreciate her thoughtful service to make the evening a special one for my girlfriend. She offered complementary cheese cake and fruit tea which is great way to round up a memorable evening. Shout out to Pat for her excellent service!"
Great service and steaks!,"Great service, the tomahawk was amazing! We did a birthday celebration and they were super friendly and gave us a birthday special"
Great service and food,We had a great meal at opus to celebrate our anniversary. The food was great and our waitress Patricia was fantastic - first class service all the whole night. Highly recommend.
Opus Review,"Alvin, one of the staff at Opus, was attentive, his service was very good. He gave us recommendations on the food and wine and he's friendly. What he did for us made our dining experience more memorable"
Burnt Tomahawk - Quite literally a bitter disappointment,"We went there to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday after checking out the positive reviews here and on Google. We left at the end of the night wishing we had gone to another steakhouse instead. Our experience was so drastically different from the glowing reviews that I wondered if a different team had taken over the restaurant.

SERVICE: When we arrived at 6pm, we were informed that 3 items were unavailable. Considering the supply chain issues these days, we accepted their explanation. No substitutes were suggested. No recommendations were made when ordering. No attempt to introduce themselves or the restaurant specials if any. No biggie. We scanned the menu and decided for ourselves. (-1 for service)

Although the restaurant was not full, my friends had to refill their own wine glasses. They marketed themselves as an upscale steakhouse with prices to match. The wine service alone fell short of upscale standards. For the rest of the meal, one of us had to get up regularly and walk to the side table to refill the wine glasses. (-1 for service)

APPETIZERS: We were underwhelmed. Oysters were edible but nothing to shout about. You can find good quality oysters at an oyster bar or even one of the better hotel buffets. Among the appetizers, the foia gras terrine was a disappointment. The red wine plum jelly was too bland and watered-down to accompany the terrine which ended up overly sweet.

After changing our appetizer plates, they realized they had given us the wrong-sized plates for the mains and unceremoniously hurried over to clear them away, despite the fact that two of us had already put food on them. They explained we had to make space for the Tomahawk later. Had the wait staff been more attentive, this mix-up should not have occurred. (-1 for service)

MAINS: Biggest letdown of the night. We ordered a medium-rare Sanchoku Tomahawk. We got a semi-cremated carcass that looked like it was rescued from a fire scene yet still raw and bloody at certain parts. The cooked section was downright bitter. Staff blandly explained that this was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù due to the chargrill process and flavor of the coals. A burned steak is a burned steak. Meat should not taste bitter. Period. So they took it back to the kitchen and returned the DOUBLE-GRILLED Tomahawk to us. By now the Tomahawk was beyond repair. If it was bitter the first time, it was practically carcinogen after cooking a second time. (-1 for food)

Through it all, the staff insisted that bitter steaks are ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù At this establishment, perhaps.

The chef came out to speak with us. One of us requested that he take his time and go easy on the flames. To his credit he was agreeable and gave us a replacement steak. Unfortunately, he apparently decided to forego the chargrill process altogether. Not wanting to trouble the staff any further, we decided to just eat our dinner as is. The second Tomahawk was edible but lacked the distinct smoky flavor that we came for. (-1 for food)

REMARKS: Were there any highlights from our visit to Opus? Nope. We do appreciate the curly-haired lady in charge of clearing our plates and topping up water. She was the one who attended to us most often. The staff also provided us with free complimentary cake for the birthday girl which we appreciated. None of these gestures are enough to convince us to return to Opus ever again."
Great Sunday Brunch,Went there for the Sunday brunch. Excellent food and excellent service by all the staff. The service could not have been better - something that is rare in Singapore. The only thing which could have been improved was the quality of the ice cream. I think it had partly defrosted and been re-frozen as there were ice crystals present and was not as smooth and creamy as it should be.
Anniversary,"Good service provided by quadrat, take time to describe the difference between different steak and dessert"
"Wonderful, warm hearted meal at Opus Bar and Grill","Amazing food! This is my favourite steaks in Singapore amazingly beefy, uicy and with the char that id die for. But Opus doesn't just have the best, perfectly cooked steaks, their service is impeccable; they take great care of you, and in Singapore, that is a true rarity. Our server advised us on sides and portion side and even went out of his way to curate our dessert experience making us feel not only satisfied at the food but as if we were in the house of an old friend.

An unforgettable experience, definitely one of the best, if not the best in Singapore!"
Opus bar and grill,"The staff especially Ms Patricia and Mr. Prasad is always ready to help and attentive, the premises are extremely clean, the atmosphere is lovely, and the food is both delicious and beautifully presented. A GEM service and make you feel relax and comfortable."
Opus Sunday Brunch Buffet,"Delicious brunch buffet with quality spread and service. Favourites were seafood (crab & prawns), grilled whole fish cooked live, wagyu scotch eggs, and cream pasta. Desserts were mostly amazing, loved the cheesecakes, homemade yoghurts, creme brulee, macarons and pralines! Thank you Opus for the complimentary cake for my parents' anniversary!"
"Opus, class of its own.","Freshness of food to service to value for money.. The seafood sharing is awesome! And the free flow of wine for 2 hours, a must try when in Singapore"
"Fantastic food, great ambience","The food served here is wonderful. We ordered iberico pork and a ribeye steak, both were well prepared and doneness was well executed."
Opus bar and grill is the spot,Great food and service! The quality of food is outstanding and priced to match. Recommend coming any chance you get.
Excellent Food & Hospitality,"We truly enjoy the lunch buffet. All the food were delicious. So tasty. The foie gras toppings were excellent. The fish that comes with the Thai style sauce were delicious. The black pepper crabs were done just right. The seafood, meat and dessert sections were fabulous. Alaska crab and oyster were my favourites. We can see that the whole team at Opus Bar & Grill gone out of their way to make this Singapore National Day Special Buffet lunch a memoroable one for us. We were also delighted to be introduced to the head chef of the restaurant, young and vibrant young chef with excellent culinary skills. Special thanks goes out to Mr Push, the restaurant manager..very warm personality. He took care of our needs and provided the special cutleries for the alaska crabs. His team of managers, chefs and staff assistance were wonderful and friendly...We can see that they really put in the extra efforts to make us feel comfortableA well thought through curated menu...I'm so full now . Thank you so much for the hospitality ."
Excellent Experience,"The food is 1000% the best of the best! The oyster, the steak and brocolini definitely are worth every bite. The Sous chief was very hands-on and really interact with us and most specially Patricia - look for her she will really assist you with the best service. Shes the best! We will definitely come back. Love this place and my favorite to go to now"
Voco experience,"Experienced a warm welcome from the team. We stayed at Voco for our 6 weeks vacation in Singapore and we felt like home instantly. OPUS offers an extensive range of food and drinks from different countries. Special shout out to Push, the restaurant manager who makes his way out to make you feel at home. He and his every team member in the restaurant including the egg chef, noodle bar chef and all the chefs work tirelessly at the back kitchen deserve a recognition for their dedication and achievement. Thank you."
Bday dinner and drinks,"Great service and good food. Had a good time celebrating my Bday dinner with a good friend.

The staff are very friendly and pro active. They will definitely help you out w the menu choices and give advise on what would suit your palate.

They also surprised me with a bday cake at the end of the night"
Wonderful Dinner with Frens,"Thoroughly enjoyed the evening with frens at Opus One. The food was very good together with wine. The sommelier (Janson) was ever so helpful and his service was just as good.
The meats were done very nicely. Compliments to Giles too!"
Perfect meat,"It is a nice place to have dinner in, friendly staff, the food is really good they cook it just perfect as we requested. Only some area it is a bit too dark for me."
Pleasant experience,"Had a Father‚Äôs Day celebration here. Atmosphere was good, staff was friendly and most importantly, food was great. Will come back again."
"Good food, great ambience","The food was great and served timely. The foie gras was served exceptional well, being the highlight of our dinner. Will definitely be back again for more!"
2nd visit,"Restaurant was quick to admit their mistake in their menu displayed on their website and was willing to prepare what we wanted even though it‚Äôs not supposedly to be served at that weekend lunch timing. And gave us complimentary desserts.

Bread was cold and stale, and butter was no thawed. Other than that, Food quality for mains (cod and barramundi) and side (calamari) were acceptable though on a pricey side.

will consider to return to try their buffet lunch on another occasion."
Good service by Prasad,"When we ordered dessert and it took long to come, he explained to us of the delay without us asking and he gave us a dessert on the house that was what my gf had wanted!"
Disppointing meal.....,"Love going to steakhouses and wanted to try something new. The reviews for Opus were really good so was pretty happy I managed to get a table at the last minute on Saturday. Maybe that was an alert given the difficulty in getting reservations at my other favourite restaurants. I ordered the bone in ribeye, the garlic mash, mac and cheese, a side of scallops and some desserts. The steak came out within 10 mins which really made me wonder whether someone else had rejected it. Anyway, quick review:
1. Ribeye: It was the blandest piece of meat I've ever had in a restaurant and despite being specific, it was not charred on the outside. Terrible.
2. Mash: Inedible. I was told there was garlic in it but it was like mashed garlic with some potatoes in it.
3. Mac and cheese: Bland and tasteless.
4. Scallops: Only one person had it and ended up with food poisoning.

When I told the cleaner (I'm calling him this cause he wasn't my main server and claimed to be the bartender) that the mash was way too garlicky, his only reply was that unfortunately, he only mixes drinks and doesn't cook the food.

The one positive of this place is that I thought the service was good. They were attentive and it wasn't difficult getting their attention."
Fulfilling afternoon,"We had seafood platter and the 1kg porterhouse steak. Plus sides and 2 soup. Salmon on the seafood platter arrived half raw,probably thawed and cooked.
The blueberry cheesecake was delicious! Best part is we have a sleeping infant and the staff managed to get us a pool towel to use as a blanket as baby was sleeping in the pram. Innovative."
Pleasant Dining,"My daughter and I was having our dinner there for the first time. And we definitely will go again. The service are good. Waiter and waitress are polite and friendly. The food and it quality and quantity are excellent. Their complimentary cheese bread is excellent, we like it so much. Can‚Äôt find it at outside bakery."
"Excellent food, excellent service","Foie gras, scallops and bone-in ribeye was to die for. Many thanks to Prasad and Manickam who made my daughter‚Äôs birthday extra memorable with their kind service and going that extra mile. A+"
Overpriced medicroe steak restaurant w lukewarm service,"We Had steak and breakfast inclusive Staycation Package. For dinner, the 1kg bone-in rib rye steak came very red and after few minutes blood can be seen oozing out gradually from the meat slices with 50% tendons to meat ratio. We were rather disappointed as we had specifically ordered for medium and not expect such bloodiness as well as tough tendon. We actually feedback to the server but nothing was done and we just left half of the steak slices with tendons and red rare bloody parts untouched. For breakfast service was also lukewarm service with medicroe food execution. Overall definitely nt worth $158++ for dinner and $38++ for breakfast if not inclusive in Staycation. Money much well spent elsewhere w similar settings."
First visit for wagyu,The food was great by the chef and service crew was very good and attentive. Will come back again next time
Meat-ogether staycation and dinner at Opus Bar and Grill,"We had an amazing experience at the restaurant! The service staff were sincere, friendly and meticulous! We love the quality of meat and the steaks are done perfectly! Thank you to the team especially Janson who was very helpful and friendly, making us feel right at home! Will be back again! highly recommended!"
Tomahawk & Oysters,Tomahawk was nicely done! And the oysters are fresh!!! Price for tomahawk was good and for meat lovers the size was good for 2-3 pax.
best service,the food deserves 10 thumbs up.. Prasad and team's service deserves a hundred thumbs up!!! Thanks for the excellent service!
Awesome experience,"The food was good, ambience was okay. The service crew was outstanding. Very attentive. Will definitely go back again!"
Perfect Birthday celebration,Thanks to the wonderful team from Opus bar and grill. Our dining experience was unforgettable. Shout out to Patricia Koh for the impeccable service!
Great Tomahawk steak and wine dinner experience,"My friend and I both loved to eat steak so we decided to come to Opus to enjoy our dinner yesterday. Really recommend to get the whiskey-aged 1.2kg Tomahawk steak for sharing, which came with 2 complimentary sauces and a selection of sea salt. The steak did not disappoint! The chef flambed it as well, which we didn't anticipate at all, but made the steak all the more appetising. Broccoli and mashed potatoes were delicious and portioned well. The free-flow wine option is definitely a must-do, too.

Ended off the dinner with a blueberry cheesecake to share and some cappucino! The service provided to us by the staff was impeccable. Attentive, but not intrusive. I am definitely raving about it with my other friends, especially on Instagram, and yes, I can't wait to return again!"
Birthday dinner,Went there for a birthday dinner. Had a amazing dinner with wine and steak. The steak was delicious and definitely make a very satisfying birthday meal.
Anniversary dinner,"Visited on 27th dec for my first anniversary and the staff & food were amazing :-) felt extremely welcome and was well attended to the entire evening. Shoutout to Manickam for the great service and for making us feel comfortable throughout, will be back when we have the chance to! merry xmas opus team!"
Dinner-Steakation,"Had a steakation in October 2021. Love the food. Love the free flow wine. Definitely, would go back for special occasions."
A great Christmas season dinner,"We were eager to have dinner at Opus where we had enjoyed so many dinners in years past. We fell in love with their new and delicious complimentary cheese-covered bread with sweet butter. If they sold that bread by the loaf, we would have bought one to take home and share with our family. We shared a US Angus rib eye with fat juicy grilled asparagus (both were delicious). We were happy to see that they had Moscato wine available. Service was friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was informal but quiet and comfortable. It was in an ideal location for us because we were staying at the Hilton. We had an excellent Christmas holiday dining experience at Opus Steak House."
Naavien Sucks,"We dined 4 times in Opus Bar and Grill in Singapore and never we had experienced the rude and curt comment of one staff there. His name is Naavien. My wife was tipsy due to their free flow wine and forgot to put on mask. He SARACASTICALLY said ‚Äúmaam you look beautiful tonight!!!‚Äù And my wife went awkward and he said after put her mask on. Come on Naavien! You should have done better in letting your customers know what you are about to say.

You have ruined our experience for 4 years. We have never been humiliated like this while spending almost 300sgd for a meal."
"Great food, great service!","My visit to this restaurant was a very pleasant and memorable experience. The ambience, food & service throughout my dinner was exceptional.

The steak which I ordered was so juicy and tender. The staffs were so friendly and helpful which made the experience even better.

I would definitely be back again! Cheers!"
Fantastic once again,"Went to catch one of the last steakcations before the end of the season. One of the main reasons for returning after countless visits is because of the service we always receive when we are there. I wish to highlight a few outstanding service personnels that made a huge difference.

1) Anoine - Always the busiest guy on the floor working from morning to night. I have to take my hat off this guy for having the warmest service even after working for a super long day. Thank you for making an effort to be around when we are. Deeply appreciated. Sorry we didnt manage to catch you the last we were there since u were at a private event. Hope to be able to catch you the next time round!

2) Joel - Despite meeting you only twice, your extra mile showed how sensitive you can be to details. Thank you for taking our doubts out of the 2 types of fries! I wont mention it here so you wont hv to do it every single time haha ;) your passion in service is heartfelt and sincere. We appreciate every single bit of it.

3) Kalai- Mr Kalai Mr Kalai, what can we say to thank you enough for your fabulous zest in your job, from the time we stepped in until the end of the night, we see you from table to table, pouring your heart to service at every single diner. You listen to our requirements and anticipated our needs. You went extra miles to ensure every single one of our visit was well taken care of. It is no wonder my daughter would always look around for Kalai GorGor whenever she is there. Thank you once again for your extraordinary service.

Also to thank all the rest of the staff at Opus, all of you have been great! We look forward to our next visit there. Of course, food is fantastic! Thank you for your hard work Chefs!"
Steak Dinner,"Beautiful restaurant and kitchen, great ambience and atmosphere! We were served by Daniel and Aw Kok Boon, who were both very accommodating and attentive to our dinner orders. There was even complimentary cheesecake for my partner's birthday :) 11/10 would recommend for the reasonably priced and delicious steak!"
Disappointing dining experience,"I've been to the restaurant on 3 separate occasions. When I made my first visit in Oct 2020, I ordered wagyu ribeye, boston lobster, sides, stroll in the forest, flameboyant banana and a bottle of wine. Wagyu ribeye and the overall food quality is good. There was an ongoing 50% off selected wine by the bottle and I wasn‚Äôt aware such promotion exist and was not told anything earlier throughout the night despite. I came to know about it when the total bill came. I wonder why the staff couldn‚Äôt be bothered to share the ongoing promotion (if any) with the guests.

I thought it would be a good idea to get my friends to get a taste of the food. We were there at the restaurant in Dec 2020 and ordered the tomahawk, lamb skew, dry aged rib, sides, risotto, stroll in the forest and classic American slice. To our horror, risotto turned out to be the best dish and the tomahawk (the most expensive dish) & dry aged rib was extremely tough and dry. It was disappointing.

For the first time I celebrated Christmas in Singapore and I had Christmas semi-buffet brunch from 1230 to 3pm at the restaurant. By the time I arrived at the restaurant, it was full and chaotic. Chairs were missing and we couldn‚Äôt get seated and decided to seat near the entrance (low coffee table). Although it was not comfortable, at least we avoided the noisy dining hall. The restaurant is understaffed/slow food go cold. The menu seemed extensive and impressive, but the great disappointment happened when main course was served. Char grilled tenderloin medium endup tough and dry. The staff kindly offered to replace the overcooked steak. We waited impatiently and we were served with overcooked steak again. We finally decided to walkaway without eating the main course. It might be most thoughtful if beverages are included i.e. hot coffee/tea to end of the buffet.

Now unfortunately, my friends are reluctant to revisit the restaurant."
Excellent Team @ Opus Bar & Grill Singapore!,"My compliments to
Anthony
Kalai
Manickam
Huda
Haris
Antoine
For their excellent service and attention to detail. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed wining and dining here to celebrate her birthday and the Team at Opus did not disappoint . All the people mentioned above were friendly, cordial, professional and all smiles;-). I hope Hilton hotel management will take note of these excellent staff that have excelled in bringing back the customers with their professional work ethics and attitude. Well done !"
Greeted like family,Fresh fish prepared simply but well. The service couldn‚Äôt have been friendlier or more accommodating. Very nice evening overall.
Excellent Food and Service,"One of the best date nights ever. We were greeted with super warm welcome the moment we arrive at the restaurant. The service staffs Daniel and Jing Zu lead by Anthony were superb. They were friendly, knowledgeable and always make the right recommendations. Ordered the Wagyu Tomahawk as the main, and it arrived with style as the chef flame grilled the entire tomahawk in front of us. Definitely an insta worthy moment."
Great food and outstanding service for birthday celebration!,"We revisited Opus Bar & Grill last night for my wife's birthday celebration after having a wonderful steakation back in April 2021. Once again, the food was really great! We had Seafood Platter with side of mash potatoes and cream spinach. Most importantly, the service was outstanding and special mention to Mr. Razak who was very attentive and made sure we had everything we need!"
Excellent Service!,We visited the Opus restaurant during our staycation. Food and service were good. Special mention to their staff Jovin who was very service oriented and attentive to our needs. He was very friendly and had a good service attitude as well. Overall our staycation in this hotel was a pleasant experience we enjoyed very much.
Good steak and wine,"The place is fine, does decent food but the ambience is dimly lit. Well that may have its impact to create a cosy look, but the lights are so less that you cannot make out the colour of the table or the food clearly. V ordered a couple of things and the food was tasty and nicely presented. Beef steak was the showstopper. The service is average, and the menu offers variety. The seating arrangement is kind of tight. It gives a feeling of walking away."
"Good Food, Great Service!","Visited Opus Bar and Grill in Sept for dinner with my partner. We had a Wagyu and Lobster sharing platter and a side of fries. The food was good, especially for the lobster which was fresh and succulent, but we felt the steak was honestly just okay. It was done well but the cut could be better. However much could be said for the service - the food and drinks arrived very promptly and all the staff were very attentive to our needs and our server Manickam went the extra mile to provide us with an excellent experience and ambience. Would recommend!"
Great food and service,"Me and my wife had a staycation at Hilton Singapore and it was a last minute decision to have dinner at Opus Grill.
It was indeed a wise decision as we had an enjoyable evening and dinner there.
Food was great and service was attentive but not intrusive.
The oysters were juicy and very fresh. The 1.2kg wagyu Tomahawk beef was cook to perfection. Strongly recommend to order salad or grilled fat green asparagus to go with the beef.
Thank you for the wonderful experience!"
Catching up with Friends,"Its been a great night with friends. Tenderloin steak is superb and G&T is my new fave. What makes it more special here is the warmth and very friendly service of Navienne and Kalai, they are gems. Kudos guys! Keep it up"
good place to hang out,"As always Opus never fail to impress me with the food , drinks (esp the g&t) and ofcourse a top notch service. Special mention to Navienne and Kalai and the rest of the team for always providing good and impecable service."
Dinner Experience,"Marvelous Service Thank You For Your Service And We Had A Good Dinner With All My People And The Food Was Good Was Fries And Tenderloin The Food Is Excellent

I Would Like To Comment Navienne For All This Hard Work Serve Us Like Personal Butler Thank You And He Will Serve Your"
Excellent service and great food,"Food was great. Enjoyed the 2hr free flow of wines. Ordered The signature tomahawk, broccoli and sweet potato fries. Delish! Special thanks to Kalai and Joel for their attentive service. Will be back."
Goof food and better service,"The food and service were excellent.
Scargo, gr√≠lled pargo fish and grouper fillet tasty,.
The dessert was very good.
Bryan is an outstanding host."
Thank you to Jennifer & Team,Came by for breakfast earlier even thou we were booked for a later slot. Was glad that the team accomodated us and was all cheery early in the morning at 7! Jennifer was really warm and hospitable. She made our breakfast a really enjoyable one!
Second Visit and Still Amazing,"This evening was actually my second visit to Opus ‚Äì this time for my anniversary. Everything from the food to hospitality made the dinner experience exceptional. The staff made us feel as though we were meant to be there despite them having a full house tonight. We ordered the crab cakes, wagyu tomahawk, mashed potatoes, and fruity tutti, and all were bursting with flavour (especially the tomahawk ‚Äì tender and juicy).

Special thanks to Joel, Anthony, Manickam, Jing Zu, and Kalai ‚Äì we wanted to give recognition to every member of the team for making our anniversary dinner such a pleasant experience. Will definitely be back again!"
Compliments,"The staff at Opus was really thoughtful and sweet, especially Manicun! Enjoyed thoroughly! We were very well taken care of throughout the dinner and it was meomorable!"
Tea at,"This was my first time visiting Opus Bar grill. The food tasting was amazing, and the service crew, especially Jing Zu was wonderful. Jing Zu was caring and able to attend to our requests, even exceeding our expectations by going the extra mile. Thank you for giving my family and me a wonderful meal at Opus Bar Grill."
Fantastic service and Great Steaks!,"The service crew headed by Joel provided great service and recommendations on food and wine. We had a Wagyu steak and Lobster sharing plate which Manickam recommended and was a great choice. The steak was succulent & juicy. The lobster could be better as we did not like the sauce on it- a personal preference. Kalai took some really nice photos for us and was always on hand to top up the fries and drinks which was free flow due to a promotion.

We saw another couple at the next table table with the Whiskey Flamed Tamohawk beef and it looks delicious! We will be back soon to try it !

Thank you for making our day and we totally enjoyed our dinner at Optus!"
Opus at Hilton,"Quite dim at the corner I was seated at. Was an anniversary dinner with my husband but apparently Opus doesn‚Äôt think anniversaries are important as they only helped birthday boys & girls (or men and women) celebrate with cakes and candles. Our female staff was a little impatient when we asked for assistance to take our photo and just walked away when we said ‚ÄúThank you so much, sorry to trouble you.‚Äù? Not a very memorable visit for our first wedding anniversary and although food (we ordered steak) was good, it doesn‚Äôt draw us back for a second visit. Recommended for maybe a friends gathering or birthday celebration but definitely not a romantic evening."
Evening of Steaks & Lobsters,"Food was adequately portioned. Even without the sauces, the steak and lobster itself is sufficiently flavoured to tantalize the pallet. My advice would be to eat it as it is before trying it with the sauces. Bernaise sauce is the one to pick if you really want a food orgasm in your mouth for the steak."
Hilton Opus Grill: Beat Away the Covid Blues,"The recent government posture of forbidding dining in the next day for a month in made me rush to make a dinner booking with my favourite steak restaurant: Opus Grill and Bar.

And my impulse won big, because I got to meet the wonderful service staff of the restaurant. You know that you're well pampered when they quickly ask if you'd like water to start with, versus shoving the drinks menu to make a quick buck. Complimentary cheese bread what's your appetite, and you get it served with attentive Tina. She noted my preference if asking for extra butter, and bothered to bring new slabs for each of us with the next round of bread, even though I didn't ask for it. Then you're visited by the Hotel Manager Walid who took care to ask after everyone at the table during these trying times.

To top it off, the star of the night was Manickam, who regularly checks in on us throughout the meal, topping up our glasses of water/wine, and asking how else the dining experience could be made better. His infectious and congenial disposition, coupled with his discreet professionalism, gives you the impression of a private butler service that comes with a 6-star hotel.

Hilton's always known for impeccable quality, and the tomahawk I ordered came excellent medium well. Additionally, Manickam checked in with us to ask if we'd prefer the single serve of tenderloin be cut into pieces so that my old folks could share the single dish comfortably.

I'll definitely come back to the Hilton Opus restaurant, not just for the delectable food, but also for a fine dining experience that every customer deserves, regardless of their status, affiliations, or order."
Excellent food and wonderful service,"It is our first visit to the restaurant to celebrate my son‚Äôs birthday. Very impressed with the consistent great service provided by the team. The food was excellent, especially the Tomahawk and the skewers. The serving portions are generous. We had a wonderful time at the restaurant. Opus is a hidden gem and I will highly recommend this place. Definitely will visit again."
"Great service , great steaks..time and time again!","This is the only restaurant we come back to time and time again in Singapore.
The food is consistently good, I have never have a bad experience. The steak is always good to perfection and well presented. What really sets Opus apart is the service, everyone really works hard to ensure you have an enjoyable experience ..special thanks to Manickam at our last visit!"
"Great food, even better service","Great steak at reasonable prices. Service was phenomenal, very attentive team serving my friend and I. Special mention to Kok Boon the manager & Kalai (Muthu)

Great chemistry and were able to give really good recommendation."
Opus - opulent service,Most excellent hospitality and service by Joel at opus. A true representative of what hospitality and service means. I am truly impressed by his friendliness and ability to engage and connect. Will be back!
Date night,"Very impressed by the food, service and overall experience! The dishes were beautifully presented and the flavours were excellent! Especially enjoyed the sea bass in papillote and would come back again and again just to have that dish! Now we know why this seemingly hidden away restaurant is so crowded on a week day night.."
Friendly staff but disappointing food quality,"Stayed at Hilton recently for a staycation. Went for the breakfast and was terribly disappointed with the food quality. Ordered eggs Benedict but the yolk was overcooked. Quickie clearly quality control of food was not there. Perhaps manpower issues due to Covid. Nonetheless, the restaurant should look into this as food quality is one defining factor in a restaurant‚Äôs success."
Subpar Food Quality,"My husband and I ordered the lobster and steak take away from Opus to celebrate our 10th Wedding Anniversary as we are in semi-lockdown again. We were so disappointed with the quality of the food. First of all, the food arrived more than half hour early from our chosen time - and it was cold. There were no heating instructions included. But the most disappointing part was the quality of the steak and the lobster. Coming from a reputable steak house, I expected more than that. The steak was blend and just mediocre. Nothing special at all. The lobster was not fresh and size of the lobster was a joke!
For the money we spent, it was definitely not worth it at all! And if you're celebrating a very special occasion, think twice before you order from this restaurant."

"Delicious lunch, great service!","We had the special 2-course lunch with beverage. The pink grapefruit was refreshing. We'd coffee in our room, so we did not choose coffee or iced coffee/tea. Karen was polite, friendly and offered to take photos for us too. Thanks Karen! Appetiser, crispy calamari is very good. Main course - tandoori wrap is good. Dessert - tiramisu in a jar - was a good end to the meal. Great service - good start to our stay at Hilton. Many thanks Karen and staff!"
Stakes was tepid,"Disappoint the services, ordered stakes comes late and tepid.
Paid the overpriced quality and services."
Dinner at Opus,Had a fairly delicious meal here at Opus Grill & Bar here at Hilton Singapore. The food is generally delicious and drinks are a delight. Service was also pretty friendly during dinner service. Really likes the Mac & Cheese. French onion soup was admittedly disappointing. Rest if the dishes were good. Sadly forgot to take many pictures. Overall a good meal.
Thank you for the wonderful experience! üòÑ üëç,"I would like to give compliments to your staff during one of my visits to the restaurant.

My partner and I visited Opus Bar & Grill Restaurant for its afternoon tea, on the 23rd Apr (Fri) from 2-4pm.

We were immediately served by your staff, Mr Kalai, who politely and clearly introduced us to the menu as well as the various options that we could select. The seafood top-up was our best choice, where we were being treated to very delicious and fresh seafood! The oysters, lobsters, prawns etc. were one of the freshest we had ever tasted!

We were subsequently being served the fondue and the sweet savory of your high tea, completed with your perfect and fresh black coffee that was also one of the best we have sampled!

Kalai was very professional throughout the session, serving us diligently, and he has also a very pleasant disposition, attending to our needs and questions promptly, and most importantly, made us fee so much at home in your restaurant! We had such an enjoyable and memorable afternoon!

Do help me to convey our deepest appreciation to Kalai (and also to the rest of your team that afternoon), and kudos to your restaurant for having such dedicated and passionate staff to serve your customers!

I will definitely be going back again soon, the next trip would be to taste the well-acclaimed Tomahawk steak!"
Highly Recommended,Nice ambience to celebrate the birthday with the girlfriend. Spontaneous & good working attitude staff. Very helpful. Food is good. Worth the spending. Will definitely be back !
Great service and good food!,"Made a reservation to celebrate my wife's birthday. The service by the hosts are great, especially Tina who made sure we are taken care of.
The food is good, price is reasonable and the free flow wine deal is a steal.
Finished off with a complimentary birthday cake by the restaurant.
I will be back again!"
Awesome dinner!,"The family had our dinner at opus recently and we enjoyed ourselves. We ordered the tomahawk steak and the presentation of it was awesome. After the steak has been served, the server poured some alcohol onto it and set the steak ‚Äúon fire‚Äù. It was a visual enjoyment. It was cooked as requested to be medium rare. The sides was amazing too. Services rendered was commendable, friendly and hospitable! Thanks for the wonderful dining experience."
Another Celebration at Opus,"I had my sister‚Äôs birthday celebrations here last month and this month I returned with my family of 8 to celebrate son‚Äôs graduation.
Requested space to accommodate my grandchild‚Äôs pram and given a long table with parking space!

Starter :
crab cakes, French onion soups and crustacean bisque soups.
Having been surprised by the chef flaming our mains Tomahawk at the table on my 1st visit, this time we were 1st surprised by the crustacean bisque soup.
Ingredients were beautifully plated in the bowl and the wait staff came with small individual jars similiar to those small sake jars and poured piping hot soup into the bowl.
Wow! see the steam in the soup from the bowl.
And the wait staff would caution us, ‚ÄòHot, be careful, don‚Äôt just drink like that.‚Äô I didn‚Äôt get his name but I posted his photo.
The French onion soup is delicious too.

Sides :
cream spinach, Over the Top Opus fries

Mains :
2 Tomahawks, 1 medium and 1 medium rare and both were done right.
Of course the chef himself came to our table to flame both our Tomahawks one after another.
The family‚Äôs impressed.

Service :
It was a full house on a Sunday night for dinner. The assistant manager Kok Boon and the staff were all very busy but he still made the effort to see to every table, bringing the check and even had a quick chat with us too,

We were impressed by the part timer Leon who waited at our table, refilling our warm and cold water.
When the starter crab cakes came after the steak, he was apologetic & explained that the chefs were trying to bring out the orders as fast as they could.
And when we finally finished our steak, our order of 2 sides spinach then arrived at our table! Actually I was upset that our crab cakes & especially the spinach were served so late.
Leon kept apologising profusely. He later returned with 2 pieces of complimentary cheesecakes. He must have updated Kok Boon. A hardworking young man with a good attitude to serving customers and kept apologising on behalf of the team in the kitchen when food is served late.

We really like Opus; cosy ambience, great chefs grilling good steaks and giving attention to details in presentation of their courses.
The assistant manager, Kok Boon and his team did a good job despite running full houses on weekends.

Must try : crustacean bisque soup and flaming Tomahawk. Impressive show stoppers!"
Nice food,"Went for the breakfast in the morning, the food is nice, like their desert serving. The service can be better, some of the servers especially the waitress are not attentive and observant to the guests, and they just stand there without attend to the guest even when they are calling."
Looks very fancy and we came,"Looks very fancy and we came here for the cakes at D9.

We ordered some starters only like the mixed platter and Satay. The satay sauce has some weird prawn taste to it which we really didn‚Äôt like. The other starters were all quite oily and pretty awful in taste - chicken wings, fish cakes, meatballs. Made the mistake of ordering a cappuccino as well, which was horrid.

The cakes from D9 were average, really didn‚Äôt taste as good as they looked.

Wouldn‚Äôt come here again. Very disappointing experience."
Estounding service,I went here as part of our honeymoon celebrations (my hubby loves steaks). We were served by an attentive server named Kalai. Please ask for him when you're here! Super attentive and easy to talk to.
Excellent service and great food!,"Came here for a birthday celebration. Excellent service, ambience and food. Special mentions to the restaurant manager, Aw kok Boon! Made our day by giving us complimentary birthday cake and drinks, superb attention and service, thank you!"
A great experience,"Had wagyu sirloin and lobster share plate with asparagus as a side to celebrate our wedding anniversary. $15 free flow of red/white throughout the night is a good deal. Jing Zu who is our server is exceptionally attentive, and when he knew it's our anniversary today, he brought us a nice stack cake to celebrate with us. Engaging and at the same time not too intrusive. Great ambiance lovely crowd will come again."
Mediocre breakfast and inconsistent service,The food is mediocre. The so-called signature Hilton Breakfast is not fantastic and tasted very normal. The rice in their Nasi Lemak Set is damp and not flavourful. Service is terrible and inconsistent. Staffs did not pay attention to orders by guests.
Manickam made our night,"The sharing cut for the tomahawk wagyu steak makes this a perfect couple experience, coupled with the free flow add on that allows you to oscillate among prosecco, white and red wines, makes your Hilton experience a night to remember. But the on the cake is the excellent service provided by Mr Manickam. Not only does he patiently explain the best cuts that suit your palate from the extensive menu, but he also doesn't try to upsell. He sensitively asks what you're used to, then proposes what will titillate your palate. My parents can't consume separate servings as they're peckish eaters, and then chose to order a single serving of wagyu ribeye. Attentive Manickam requested for the chef to slice the entire serving of meat into digestible slices-perfect for sharing. My mum raved over the soft and chewy bread, and he thoughtfully made sure we were given a second serving at the table after asking if we'd appreciate another.

The tomahawk is perfectly prepared to the doneness that we expected. But without Manickam, the draw to return to the Hilton would be lost!"
