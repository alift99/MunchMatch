great choices of german beer and sharing plates,spacious warm environment for dining-in. service is prompt. sausage platter fed 2 pax well. $8++ beer during happy hour
An Obvious Staff Shortage,"I was longing for German food and this restaurant had available tables. When we arrived to the restaurant, we noticed that most of the tables were occupied, but staffing was minimal. This was obvious as the team members could be seen scurrying around the restaurant. Needless to say, my dinner companion and I were unattended for quite a while. Nevertheless, we took the opportunity to peruse the menu and decided on our order, which we placed as soon as we were seated at a table.

Dinner stated with the Smoked Mackerel Tartelette with Tomatoes and Caramelised Onions, followed by the Chicken Cordon Bleu with Potato Cucumber Salad and Cranberry Sauce. Both dishes were well cooked and tasty.

It was a pity that the service did not quite match up. We were also not served water, even though we asked for it and the beverage we ordered was served. We were empathetic and no blame was placed as the staff shortage is happening everywhere."
Good food with great service!,Good food with great service! Reuben and his colleague (sorry I didn’t get the name of that young Chinese gentleman) made great recommendations and went to great lengths to make sure we enjoyed the meal and our time there. Loved the pork knuckle and veal schnitzel! Will be back!
birthday celebration,We celebrated my birthday at Frieda. First time to try this restaurant. All the food we ordered were very good but the pork knuckle iwas phenomenal. This is the best pork knuckle i've had!
Wasn't a Pleasant Birthday Celebration 😔,"I read good review of Frieda and decided to reserve for a birthday celebration, however, I was a little disappointed at the food that we had ordered

We ordered 3 dishes, soup - Getruffelte Petersilenwurzel Cremesuppe, main course - KäseSpätzle Mit Lachs Creme Sauce Und Gouda Käse Uberbacken and Rump Steak, Spatzle, Frieda Salad. The soup was really good - would recommend to give it a try. However the KäseSpätzle main course was really overbearing of the fishy taste, it was sad as I couldn't finish the other half. Understand that it's using seafood broth or it might be the Gouda and Gruyere Cheese, in my opinion it was just too much.

The Wagyu Rump Steak was pretty delish but the Swabian Noodles tasted rather bland. Guess it was an experience but it was quite upsetting cause both of us didn't quite enjoy for the birthday dinner"
"Worst restaurant and bar, ever!","I would have give this joint a zero star it so truly deserve. I went with my colleagues on 26 Aug at about 430pm to have simple get together and celebration. Was not greeted at all at the start. We decided to just seat ourselves. Nobody attended to us for 10 mins. Was served water later and told that food /kitchen will open at 530pm. We said ok as we can have drinks first. Then 10 mins later, we were told to shift as the place we occupied has been reserved for an event. We are total fine to move to another table. No issues at all. Then we signal someone to come take our order. The server was not very polite and was even staring at us while taking our orders. Not sure why K was so uptight about before coming to us to give us that unwelcoming look. After paying for the bill and as we were wrapping up our session, another server came over to ask for us to vacate the table. We said we are packing up and no issue. But 1 min later, the same server came to me and told me ""I need the table NOW!"" That was just pure rude and uncalled for. I observed there was no one in any queue dying to come sit at the table. So why be rude to your customers who I must have been more polite compared to the staff there. There was no ""Thank you"" or the usual politeness you expect from a waiting staff. In fact, my colleagues were even more polite to thank them for every action the staff have taken. The staff did not even apologise for having to move us, for telling us later than food will only be served at 6pm instead of 530pm which means we have nothing to eat for our session. I would have gone somewhere if I knew there will not be any food served during my time there. In any case, I should not have even bother going to this place to begin with.
There are many options other that this place, Just cross over to CHIJMES next time. Just don't waste your breath at Frieda."
Very authentic German fare,Celebrated my birthday with my family at Frieda. The food was authentic and well cooked. I also liked the music that they supplied for the Beer Garden.
Dinner at Frieda,"Booked dinner seats for 2 and arrived there slightly earlier when no was crowd seen. Not given dining seats reasoned for being early. Orders were not taken at table and had to walk up to bar despite no crowd. Chope app attendance was not recorded (probably also due to arriving early?) Had to contact Chope next day to settle issue. Food, ok lah. House beer is not bad."
Interesting German meal at Freida,"It’s a lovely set lunch. The appetiser of salmon was refreshing,the prawns as main course is very fresh. Only complaint is difficult to get their attention."
Business Lunch,I've really love the ambiance and also the food . I've orderes the chicken schnitzel half portion and the dessert ice cream also unique with raspberry jam on top . Really enjoyed Frieda
Poor attitudes from serving staff,Nice ambient and good food But the poor attitudes from serving staff spoil everything. Always rushing to clear the plates even when we not done and his response to our queries so unfriendly... Rude. Sorry but will need think twice very hard to patronise Frieda again.
Anniversary date,Had a pleasant and chilling vibe during dinning. Food was aweseome and service is good too. Price is reasonable.
Very disappointing in all areas.,"When you visit the Capitol Kempinski, you have a certain level of expectation around quality of food and service. None of these expectations were met on this visit. The staff lacked any level of finesse in their service. It was a transaction at best. At even these transactions weren’t good. We were left waiting to be met on arrival for a few minutes with no apology. We asked for water which took 5 minutes to arrive and so it went on. We were talked through the menu, although there was only one copy on the table. We were told we could start at the top and work down. Nothing was further from the truth. The food came out in any order they chose. The food lacked flavour and was never warm. The dishes were never introduced, just put down on our table, as if it was an inconvenience. We ordered the free flow beverage package but had to chase for a new drink every time.
We will not return to this hotel or restaurant and would suggest other customers find better alternatives."
Birthday dinner,"Food was great love the ambiance there. Nice and cozy they have a singer there, not too noisy. Love their flammkuchen from the monthly special menu, hope they could put it in the permanent menu."
A great chef surrounded by amateurs,"Let us start with the highlight of the evening - the chef. Frieda has a young chef who made, amongst others, an amazing beef soup and a fantastic dessert.
He certainly does not deserve a service-team who is far away from his level.
A few examples:
==> We waited almost five minutes to be seated
==> We saw the beef soup ready to serve but no waiter around. After some time I wanted to pick it up by myself but the chef was too embarrassed and served us instead
==> We asked for a break after the main dish but the chef was not informed. The dessert arrived five minutes after we finished the main dish
==> The wine for the dessert arrived about 10 minutes after we were done with it
We liked the food but the rest was on a very poor level"
Great service,We had a lovely evening here with Shayne as our waitress. The experience was made lovely by her sincere attitude and genuine conversations. Will visit again!
Dinner,Awesome meals as usual. The favorite dish was the pork knuckle and of course the lager and dunkel which goes down well with the knuckle.
A different experience of German food,"Nice ambience for couples, friends, family or even business. Friendly staffs and care to explain & recommend the menu. Food presentation is excellent."
Awesome food,Awesome and delicious food! The pork knuckle was tender and crispy. The service was slow but probably lack of manpower. I would still highly recommend this place for the food!
Excellent German Food,"One of our fav place for German cuisine. Efficient and polite service, well executed dishes. Looking forward to return"
Nice meal ruined by sloppy take away service in the kitchen,"I went for lunch on the 8th January with my family, a party of 3. We all ordered the weekend brunch but decided we would take away the last course, the curry wurst.

We were given a bag with 3 boxes. On arriving home we discovered the first box contained 2 buns. Another box contained our unfinished pork skins. The final box contained crispy potatoes. No curry wurst. We also had 2 unconsumed grilled sausages we asked to take home. They were not packed either.

This ruined an otherwise enjoyable meal."
New Year Eve Dinner,Enjoyed my dinner on New Year’s Eve. Even my children enjoyed the food very much. The service was excellence too. Will be back to try other dishes.
Good food & ambience,"We went there for Christmas eve dinner, peak time but service was OK & food was good. Place is nice and spacious so you feel like you’re outdoors when you’re actually indoors with aircon. Their set was priced reasonably plus they didn’t require a deposit for Christmas eve. Overall, happy with the place."
Not impressive,"The waiter was good to recommend food. But the crackling pork, nice crispy skin but the meat was tough. So was the meat in the sausage platter. The salad was good. The mulled wine was sour. Not very impressed."
Great german food!,"An authentic german restaurant with great service, food and overal experience. They also serve good beer at an affordable price!"
SUPERB,"Always like the ambience here! Good service, good food, good alcohols! We had American sour recommended by Dushku, also a very attentive manager! Will be back again soon!"
Great Birthday Dinner,"Enjoyed the sausage platter for 4pax, fully satisfied 5 of us, and the service staff was really lovely!"
Amazing Family Dinner,"Food was really good and authentic. Nothing was overly oily / salty, and it brought back memories of our Germany trip. Service was also on point and with friendly waiters and serving staff. Will be back again!"
Dinner,Would like to appreciate the attentiveness and service of Shirlene and Davhan (hope i spell his name corretly)🙏Love the place as i love green 💚😍. Food was great and the cocktail drinks!🤤🥰. Will come back again. Jakie- 🇵🇭 Xoxo
Good experience,"The food was great! The staff are very friendly and accommodating, especially Shirleen and Nathan. It’s a good and cozy place."
"Good food, great service!","Good food, great service! So far best Pork knuckles in town :) Highly recommended. Portions aren’t big, need to order more if you have bigger appetite"
Wunderbar,"Impeccable service, Great food and atmosphere. Really enjoyed the Apple fritters for dessert! Food is a little on the pricey side but the taste is excellent. Sadly, the pork knuckle wasn’t available when I visited, which was a pity. Will definitely come back again to try the pork knuckle someday."
Pork knuckle and beers before CB2,"What a year, it strangely feels like 2020 again with the impending lockdown.

We popped by this place for some drinks for the night, and decided to order the pork knuckle, which was a great choice! Crispy, succulent and really large, we enjoyed sharing it amongst the table.

The beers were fantastic, cold and really good german beers. Price was worth."
Splendid Mother's Day Dinner,"Had a very satisfying mother's day dinner. The pork knuckle was roasted to perfection, crispy outside and juicy inside. Portion is good for 3 pax. The beef consommé was also delicious. Breads were also freshly baked and warm. It was nice for the staff to seat our family upstairs as our kids tend to be rowdy. Would love to come back again."
Best German food outside Germany,"I've lived in Germany for many years and Frieda @ The Capitol Kempinski is the best German food I've had outside Germany. Best steaks, Schnitzel with the potato salad and OMG the best Pork knuckle !!! Perhaps it's because they have a German chef as well, but from the interior design to the staff, amazing! Especially Dushku the manager was so tuned-in and present. Fabulous experience here. We'd go back again for the beer and Pork Knuckle, definitely!"
Awesome dining experience,"Excellent service by the Manager & serving staff. Also, there were generous food portion & food were tastily done."
Good food. Good service.,"We had the risotto, schnitzel, rosti, and prezel. Portions were generous. Food was delicious. Even though we are big eaters, it took an effort to finish the meal. The prezel was a highlight - good crust outside and chewy inside. Appreciate the overall home cooked feel."
Friday at Frieda’s,"First time at Frieda’s and we were swayed by the 38SGD pp set Dinner as part of Singapore Restaurant Week.
The restaurant is located in the Capitol Arcade next to the Kempinski Hotel. Next to City Hall MRT. The ambience of the Arcade is fairly faux but perfectly pleasant.
The restaurant is German themed which is normally shorthand for wear the elastic waisted trousers as you’ll be waddling out at the end of the evening. But not here. The food was delicious, subtle, beautifully balanced and not at all heavy. A good selection of German beer at good prices 11-14 SGD for 500ml. But best of all was the service. JJ was friendly, attentive and incredibly efficient despite having to manage both the upstairs and downstairs stations. He’s a real credit to Frieda’s and really contributed to a great evening."
German Treat,"Very tasty and well priced German fare. Excellent and helpful service. Very nice location within a repurposed Heritage building by the Kempinski Hotel. Pork Knuckle and Apple Fritters are the standout dishes. Pretty good fixed, all u can eat menu as well. Nice job by Shirlene on the beer choices"
A pricey restaurant with average food and poor service,"Went there with a friend for lunch on Good Friday. The restaurant was empty with very few customers. We were greeted and served mostly by the manager who spoke very quickly, and wearing a mask made it more difficult for us to understand his words. We felt the other waiter was much more attentive to customers and passionate in his job than the manager. Waiting time between each dish was alright, but the food was underwhelming with a standard that was definitely not on par with the price point, although the portions were justified. We ordered 2 3-course sets. The starters and desserts were alright but nothing exceptional. For the mains, the pretzel dumplings were pretty good, though we got sick of them after half the portion because it was cloyingly greasy and a tad too salty. What totally put us off was the lentil stew with sausage and noodles. The lentils had a weird taste, the sausage seemed like one that we could purchase from the supermarket to cook at home, and the ""noodles"" were nothing but plain fried dough that looked like tiny worms. Overall, the experience was bad and we wouldn't be back again for sure. Given that the place is situated at a 5-star hotel, the service and quality should have been much higher."
An overall good dining experience!,"Had a wonderful dinner at Frieda during SG restaurant week. The starter was full of balance and flavour. The main dish could have been cooked a little more tender. Dessert was ok. But most importantly, our server, Shirleen, made the evening an awesome one. Friendly and attentive. Good recommendation for the beer. Overall a good experience at Frieda!"
Great ambience and service (JJ)!,"My wife and I would like to specially commend JJ for his excellent service! He was very professional and helpful. Upon taking our orders, he advised that we might have ordered too much food, which we truly appreciated because it was our first visit and have no idea how big the serving portion might be. We heeded his advise and suggestion and when the food is served, he was spot on! If not for his advise we couldn’t have finish the food and that could lead to food wastage. Overall, the food was good, ambience was great and JJ is a superstar! ⭐️"
Lovely And Elegant Environment,"Service was excellent, and we loved the plating and the muted yet elegant surroundings.

The starter of raspberry glazed pork slice with quinoa was nice, and a light dish. The main of veal was definitely on the heavier side, with cheese and ham. In fact, the missus could not finish her piece. It was tasty though, especially with the cranberry sauce.

The desserts were a little more of a miss though. The white chocolate creme was okay, and was soft as tofu/panacotta. The mint jelly was not as nice, especially with the cream."
Good food and service,"I love the sausage plater for 2 and the pork knuckle. The sausages are delicious and pork knuckle is a a little too fatty for my liking.

JJ gave a very good recommendation and i am very please with his knowlwdge and friendly service. Will come back again if I am craving for germam sausage."
"Good food, excellent service","Food was authentic German, interesting menu too. On the expensive side but set course meal is very worth it.
Very warm service offered by Mr Nabil!"
Lovely dining experience,"We enjoyed the service from J. J who is warm and friendly. The food was good with nice choices. If you are looking for good, classic German meals, you will be pleased with the assortment and quality of foods."
Our new go-to German restaurant!,"Really enjoyed the offerings at Frieda for Restaurant Week. Probably one of the best, if not the best German restaurant on our little island nation. Our server, Shirlene, left a wonderful impression with her impeccable service - she was attentive but not over the top, and made my wife's birthday celebration a most memorable one. The $15nett beer flight also provided a wonderful sampling of 4 different beers. Way to go, Frieda!"
The server (#Shirlene) that made the difference,"We were celebrating a friend’s birthday at Frieda and was given a nice cosy spot at #Kempinski. Most of the food items (bar snacks and main course) ordered were delicious. Rosti was crisp and salmon pieces were cooked to perfection. Herring salad was amazingly refreshing though a tad salty. Beef roulade was tender and tasty. Sausage platter had great variety to sample. The only disappointment was the curry wurst- tasted too tomatoey.
The highlight was the service by Shirlene. She’s not only attentive, she would go the extra miles to make us feel so at home. Though the kitchen was closed, she managed to provide a slice of lovely chocolate fudge cake for the birthday boy. It’s with service like hers, the entire dining experience was enhanced and elevated. Thank you so much!"
Great food with reasonable price,Great food with very reasonable price. We were very well and kindly served by Aron. Nice and quiet atmosphere
Frieda restaurant,"Excellent Restaurant, was served and provided with good service from sherlene who was very attentive despite serving many tables."
Friend's birthday dinner,Love the food here and the service and ambience too. Was served by Shirlene. Very pleasant experience. Will definitely come back again
Amazing restaurant,Amazing restaurant and amazing service!! Kids friendly. Sausage taste good and we love dessert here.
Good dinner!,"Good dinner, reasonable price and great service. what more can a diner ask for. the potato leek soup was fab!"
Great service !,"JJ our table's captain was fantastic and impeccable service:)

We had great time here and really enjoy ourselved"
Friendly staff with good food.,Had a great dinner Frieda. The food was good and it felt like I was back in Germany. The service staff was friendly and attentive. JJ who was serving our table made an effort to chat with us. Friendly staff with good food.
Mr,"Service by JJ was excellent...attentive and friendly. Despite being busy, JJ paid very good attention to the customers. Good atmosphere and nice ambience. Pork knuckles were excellent. Will definitely recommend this restaurant. Will be back."
Casual lunch,"Great ambiance, lovely place to escape busy lunch hour from popular and limited spots around the area.

Awesome value for their lunch sets too below 30 dollars per person for three courses.

Staffs here reflects the same experience as my stay with their hotel (Kempinski), attentive and very friendly.

Will visit again."
Quiet and cozy lunch place on a weekday,"Conducive location for a birthday lunch celebration as it was rather exclusive due to the quiet ambience.

Bread was soft and fluffy with butter of great fragrance.
Starter had a good mix of flavors between the salad and cheese.
The main course has more to be desired as the flavours were more on the bland side and unfortunate wrong expectations relating to the pork sausage not being a german sausage.

Overall, an average experience considering the price for conducive ambience, but less than ideal main course."
Great food,"The food is great, ambiance is good.The staff were amazing. Shout to Michael and Aron. Great job guys!"
"Great 1st impressions, disappointing otherwise","The decor of the place is great and the layout inviting. The first disappointment was where we were seated considering we had reservations and the restaurant was not full .... just at the service entrance! Great customer service and common sense will tell you that that will be last place you will try to sit your guests. The second were the sausages ... it could have just gone to NTUC Finest or Jason's picked up a pack of sausages, boiled them and plated it myself. Interestingly, the waitress (Shirlene - who was great) shared that we weren't the first to comment that the sausages looked and tasted that they had come out from a supermarket."
Great food and ambience,We had the sausage platter and every element was delicious! Special mentions for the pretzel and apple fritters too
Great service and great food,Service was excellent (thanks Shirlene & JJ!) and food was great and worth it for the price. Definitely would come back again!
Pleasant experience !,"The food was pretty good! Shirlene was our table host, she was very attentive and even gave a surprise birthday cake for my mom ☺️ Thank you Shirlene !"
"Great food, wonderful service",First time here for my mother's birthday and it won't be the last! Very authentic tasting and hearty servings. Shirlene was a great host throughout and even got us a small cake for the occasion. Give her a raise!
Fried a,"very good food, especially the sausages.. Great environment. The servers are helpful and polite Will surely come back again.. Also will recommend more people"
The food & ambience was lovely!,"The food & ambience was lovely!

Highly recommend the pork knuckle!

Also, Shirlene’s service was top notch! I accidentally dropped my cutlery and she heard it from afar. On her own accord, she brought me a new set."
Birthday dinner,Nice food and atmosphere. Must try bee sting cocktail! Pleasant Ambience and great service from service staff
good service and good ambience,"first time trying out the restos at kempinski hotel. frieda, the german resto place has a nice ambience and the food is also good. thanks especially to jj and aron for the good service!"
Dinner at Freida,"The 3 of us enjoyed our dinner of pork knuckle and salad very much. JJ , our waiter was most helpful and attentive ."
Authentic Viennese food. We,Authentic Viennese food. We always get the schnitzel and sauerkraut for memories sake. Great beer and the service is excellent as always. Highly recommended.
Very good,"Amazing Restaurant. First time here and JJ was keen on explaining us about the dishes and serving our table fully committed.
The food was superb, we will definitely be back to try different menus"
Udo Jürgens and Kaiser Schmarren,"Thoroughly enjoyed this little German Gem. Authentic kitchen, great staff (Clement and JJ), home brewed beer and of course Udo."
Hang out with gal,"Good location, walking distance direct from MRT, nice ambience and comfortable sitting. Nice place to catch up with friends or love ones."
Dinner,I had dinner with my wife a few days ago and we really enjoyed the ambience there. The pork knuckle was a bit of a let down by itself (hence the 4 star review) but put the plum sauce that they serve it with and you're good to go! Clement served us well and gave us good food recommendations for 2 people.
Frieda Jan 2020,"Had the lentil stew and emmenthal sausages from the grill. The servings look average in size but they fill you up quickly. Quite tasty too. The bread at the start of the meal is excellent, and everyone gets their own dish of butter. Beer from regional German breweries is also reasonably priced for Singapore."
Great dinner,"Amazing pork knuckle (definitely enough to feed 2, maybe 3). Skin was crispy and the meat was tender and well-seasoned. I also really liked the potato side and sauce. We also had the sausages which were great. It's a pity it's no longer on Amex love dining."
Dinner at Frieda,"Very good food, especially the veal schnitzel and potato soup. Clement provided exceptional service."
Excellent German dinner!!,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary dinner at Frieda’s and this was a first time visit. We experienced excellent service provided by Ms Rebecca, who had advised about the portions. So between the two of us, we had the delicious pork knuckle and salad, which was enough for two persons, and of course with lager to go along with dinner. Food was excellent along with the fine service!"
Average food and service. Nothing to shout about,"The service was below average and cold. But I think they were short-handed. However some bright sparks from one or two staff who was helpful despite being busy. Food was so-so, had better pork knuckle (which is their signature dish) elsewhere before. The ambience and set up was very casual and small."
Very poor customer service,"Went there to book for January 2 just to make sure that we will be having a good seat for 8 person. Michael the waiter was so rude, even in informing me that I need to pay for the whole garden area if I ask him to move the tables. He can say it nicely instead and not be arrogant. On the heat of the argument he even questioned in a high tone if I did a safe check-in??!!! It’s a protocol yes for people who just stepped in your restaurant but not to question the intelligence of your customer! Common sense please! Of course I did the check-in the moment I stepped in!

Food is very good but the service is worst! This should have been our 2nd visit but after how Michael the waiter treated us I don’t think we will be coming back anymore! Thinking about it he is really arrogant anyway during the first time that we visited. But since the food was good we just brushed it off!"
Poor service,"Food is all right, a bit on the salty side.

Service is bad and slow. It took more than 45 mins for the set lunch to be served."
First visit to Frieda,The Pork Knuckle was fabulous. The dessert was excellent too. We like the ambience and service was pleasant. The ingredients used were fresh and food was deliciously prepared. It is worth a second visit.
A GREAT MEAT-UP,"For the uninitiated, it was an eye-opening and palate-pleasing experience for those among us who are not fans of meat. Kudos to the chef for the amazing pork knuckle dish - crispy, succulent and flavourful. Goes beautifully with the awesome beers - try all four mini tasters! And the cheese sausage rocks! The servers were attentive and prompt, and thumbs-up for the picturesque ambience! We had a blast!"
Nice and Cozy,"Stayed at Capitol Kempinski and walked over to this restaurant at Arcade @ Capitol Kempinski.

The ambience is good, you can opt for either high chair high table, or sofa styled or ""upstairs"" where you can have a view over all the passes by.

The food is good and well priced, not too expensive in my opinion. I ordered the Pork Knuckle, Sausage and Beef Soup. They will serve you the baked sourdough first, it was really good.

The Pork Knuckle skin was well baked, flavourful and crispy but too ""much"" meat inside. I preferred a little more fat, my personal preference.

Overall, it was a good dinner."
Dining review,"Everything worked out very fine, the food was pretty authentic and service simply excellent.
Just the atmosphere could improve."
overall ok,"the pork knuckle was not available during our visit. would be nice if they always have it as it is their “specialty”. anyway overall food is ok but not excellent. however the cheese platter, salad & pretzel are really good. Must try!"
Not too bad german food!,"Part of the hotel Kempinski serving german food. Small restaurant and the wine connoisseur was Super friendly and helpful. We were recommend with rare German red wine that taste greats ! Happy to have him waive the corkage of the 2nd bottle wine that I brought as I have was then unhappy that one of the waiters insisted to charge us a bottle regardless . Food was great with their famous pork knuckle , sausages were really well done to perfection. They served the house drafted beer and cones with few varieties but not so exotic. Do make reservation earlier .."
Excellent- service food and value for money,"Went for lunch, 2 courses for $19++, which given the quality of the food is very good value for money. Service as always was very attentive. Confusing prices on their beer but otherwise very good. Tip - if you are vegan let them know in advance, they will prepare something offmenu for you."
Never again!,"I have invited three business partners to join me for lunch and we ordered Currywurst, Pork knuckle, Wiener Schnitzel and a Sausage Platter for 2 all to share.
Service is worst: no attention given, I literally had to call and waive to be served throughout. The captain argued with me in front of my guests that he was around and didnt want to disturb us. He wouldnt stop mentioning this in a most annoying way. There were only 2 tables besides us and you cant pay attention and must debate?
Schnitzel and Pork knuckle were ok but the Currywurst was a disappointment (I am from Germany and expect for the price an authentic dish!) and the sausage platter for two were nothing special. I will never go there again, nor do I recommend anyone to bring their guest there. You will feel embarrassed."
Beautiful bar,"One of the prettiest bars with good selection of beers, wines. The service staff members were friendly and professional . Prices were reasonable too."
Customer service,The customer service is not the usual one I received. The service is not great. Bring money elsewhere.
Cosy restaurant with good food & service,"Cosy restaurant with a nice spot in the mall that it is located in, serving good Italian food with a friendly and attentive service crew providing good service. Perfect for takeout too."
Beers after work,"I've previously been here a few times for the excellent value set lunches. This particular visit was in Dec 2019 and was in the evening for a couple of beers after work with a friend. Good selection of German beer, some of which is very reasonably priced. It was very popular on the weeknight evening we were there, but fortunately we were still able to get a table."
Frieda,"Food is pretty good.
Beer i wished was a more chilled.

Service certainly needs improvements.
Staff were polite but too slow for my liking, despite the fact restaurant was only like 30% filled."
Average,"The food is pricey but the beer and wine's price is average Singapore restaurant's price. They are under staff, the service is a bit slow but the staffs are friendly. The seats we got is under the mezzanine, is warm there because the aircon is blocked."
lunch,"had the set lunch here. good service, decent food quality. decor is inviting. worth to check out if you are in the city hall area."
Great German food at reasonable price!,"Surprising discovery, fantastic and authentic German fare offered here, a must try venue. Best pork knuckle we have had. German-sized portions at reasonable prices."
Truly German fare,"Restaurants in Kempinski Arcade offers 2 course set lunch for weekdays @ $17++.

We had Baked Camembert n pan fried spatzle sauerkraut. Latter not to our taste, if you are hungry, it's not enough.

Vienna style baked chicken was good, meat loaf average. German small town butcher serves best meat loaf at €1, so for $15, not worth it.
Nuremberger sausage recommended was the best, absolutely spot on recommended by service staff. Smash potato served by Frieda is simply the best with sauce. We enjoyed n finished it which we usually avoid.

If not for 35% discount, think the meatloaf n sausage are overpriced.

Hits n misses alas."
German Feast in A Garden,"A lovely restaurant with an outdoor garden theme situated indoor. Has nice ambience for drink or a meal.

The Housmade Rye Sourdough bread is good! Texture was dense and soft at the same time, goes so well with a thick spread of butter ontop.
Pork knuckle skin was crispy and meat remains juicy. Sauerkraut not too sour, very palatable and wanting to eat more. Was expecting pretzel dumpling to be tough but they were not tough at all but soft.
Impressed by the pan fried rainbow trout, a whole fish that's easily de-boned! Served with spinach and potatoes, all come in right texture and taste.

Service was good, fuss free. Staffs goes around to chat with diners, a nice gesture to ensure guests are happy.

I left being a happy diner and got to be back for the sausages!"
Lovely Lunch,"The portion of food was good. We had a pork knuckle, a sausage platter (for 2), soup and salad to share. The pork knuckle is excellent. Crispy skin covered the moist and succulent meat. The staff was very proactive in offering split the soup (we ordered 3 to share between 6 of us) for us.

However, table service can be better - plates were taken away from the table without checking whether we are done. We had unfinished plates of salad taken away while we were still savouring it."
