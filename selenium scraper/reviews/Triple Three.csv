Sad to see you leave,Sad to see this wonderful buffet place fold. Love the ambient here. I love especially the champagne or beer buffet. Can't find this elsewhere.
Excellent service cum quality foods,"We’ve a birthday dine at triple 3 on Mar 26 with my bro-in-law and family members. Chef William Tan had provided us all nice quality foods that we really enjoy the night there.
Also with the service staffs around to assist what we needed, really deeply appreciate their warmest hospitality. With the skillful prepared foods from Chef William Tan we are feeling that it’s a nice place to visit again.
We was regularly visited Triple 3 for any occasions celebration and most of our friends was really impressed that enjoying dinning there.
Keep it up Chef William Tan and term members from Triple 3, all you guys had done a very good job and attitudes.
Cheers !!!"
Lovely Decoration and Cake,"Thank you Chef William for his great service, cake presentation and lovely chocolate to end off the meal. Food was fresh and of quality of a five star hotel ! My friends loved dining at T3"
Triple Three dinner,Dinner special lobster (meat too tough and rubbery). Dessert choice nothing to fantasy as compare to other similar hotel buffet.
Excellent service and delicious food,"I would like to compliment the staff, Cecilia Tan, because of her kindness and patient. Nice job Cecilia and thank you"
Wagyu beef special every Wed & Thu,"We've been here several times and decided to try their Wed dinner featuring Wagyu beef.

Overall very good quality of seafood, sashimi, teppanyaki, chinese food and the desserts were very much improved, especially the petit gateau (mini cakes), cheese platter and choc lava cake.

Will return in Feb to try their Lunar New Year specials."
Triple Three Lunch Buffet,"Had a Sunday lunch buffet with my family - food and service was very good.
Even though the restaurant is very packed, the food was served to us very promptly the moment we sat down - first we were given the cold cut plate and then a cream of chicken soup each before we started to order for the buffet. I think is a good gesture to provide as we are already eating while waiting for the food. Upon submitting the order, the food came quickly and was of good quality especially the sashimi and oysters were very fresh.
Special thanks to Chef William and team for his good service and awesome food served. And special mention to Cecilia and Nicholas for the warm table service as well.
Will definitely recommend!"
"Best Ham, hands down!","We had a Xmas ham takeaway in November and everyone adored it, the tenderness, the fragrance, the succulence. It was wiped out without trying.
Unfortunately, our ham for Xmas Eve did not come due to the recent Covid-19 incident of the hotel.
We settled for a ham from Colony, Ritz Carlton instead.
The difference was too vast, and there was still a lot left on the dining table.
I will wait for your ham next year, Mandarin Orchard!"
WEdding Anniversary Stay,"We had breakfast there during our wedding anniversary stay the night before. Probably wasn't expecting much due to the Covid-19 pandemic but was surprised that they actually provide us with excellent services. Though can't say it for all the staff but majority of the staff are attentive enough to ask us how is food is? Whether we have enough? Or if we need more food etc. Well isn't this part and parcel of services! On a whole., excellent place to have breakfast there."
Enjoyable girls’ night out,"Great overall experience! Lovely ambience, superb services and fantastic freshness of food. Already expected it has to be great food due to the cost and the restaurant didn’t disappoint. They delivered the quality with a punch."
Birthday Celebration,"We celebrated children's birthday in Triple Tree yesterday, we had a very good time, the food was delicious, service was very good, especially Cecilia and Chef William, our children had a memorable birthday!"
Impressive,"We had a dinner on 22nd Nov with free flow beer promotion. But we don’t drink alcohol if the promotion also include soft drinks, it would be nice. Seafood is fresh and yummy. Beef cube tender and Sashimi Mr Parani was excellent service"
Dinner buffet,"We had the buffet dinner on the Lobster Saturday theme. Great food quality overall (especially the seafood; lobster, crab leg, prawn, etc). Service staff was helpful and friendly.
However, due to COVID restrictions, the buffet was not self-service, but instead ordered via paper order chits. Somehow this resulted to long waiting time for each order."
"Good array of quality food, excellent service staff","Buffet Dinner on a Friday night. Crowd was there but good spacing in restaurant.
Ambience is great, allowing good conversation.

Ordering was through paper but the food came speedily and efficiently. Quality is excellent, from selection available, food material, plating and presentation.

Service was excellent, peculiarly we were much impressed by most by a table cleaner rather than the servers, humility and passion in service is utmost.

Location is great, hotel is just off the nearest Somerset MRT, easy to locate and a short walk to."
Great Dining Experience!,"Was shown to table promptly , layout on table was neat. Was inform on how to order by ala carte. All the dishes was serve promptly and in a nice layout . Clearing of plates , refill of water was prompt . After the dinner , one surprising talk between me and my wife was on one of the staff whom we found very helpful and nice . I managed to get his name , Palanj.. he did managed to leave a deep impression with us along during the dinner . Kudos to him !"
excellent service and free flow of beer,"Free flow of hot beverage and beer.! Since covid, I had come for the buffet twice and this Sunday will be my 3rd time. Had been to hotel buffet and I would highly recommend here with very attentive staffs clearing plates after plates and filling your drinks frequently. Quality food in ala cart method but putting in abit more options will be 100% perfect. Still back here after going to many other hotel buffets in term of service, value, quality. Do keep up !"
Quality food with excellent service crew,"With Covid safety measures in place, the buffet choices are now more limited - suggest adjusting the buffet prices accordingly if possible. However, the essentials are still available and quality is maintained. Although ordering of food items is manual (using order sheet), the service crew is excellent and attentive, serving everyone tirelessly! Keep up the great service and food quality."
Not an ideal place for celebration,"I have called and informed the restaurant that it was for my son 21yrd old birthday, the restaurant mentioned that they will provide cake for us to celebrate. But was not given and the wait was slow.
An unpleasant waitress and the area that was seated seemed like a convention hall. Horrible experience xxx..
How many 21yrs old birthday once had!!!"
Disappointed birthday dinner,"We thought, ""hey, buffet place within a reputable hotel should be trusty enough to have a birthday celebration there."" But man.. we were disappointed from the 1st round of ordering through the meal.

Covid changes the way buffet dinner works, and we are fine about it. Perhaps cut the usage of order sheets and go with ipad ordering. The service was ok but it was the hassle to wait and request for replenish of order sheets. Other than that, the service crew were pleasant and went all out to make our dining experience an enjoyable one. Maybe to compensate for the poor quality of food below stated.

Variety was fewer than we expected; we found ourselves limited with choices after 1st round. Seafood was edible, just not fresh enough and quality was not there for buffet of U.P $100+/pax. Normally we would go for many rounds of oysters, prawns and salmon sashimi, but we took not even a full 2 rounds that night. Only 1 round of fried stuff came hot, other times were lukewarm or room temp. Pasta dishes, we assume they were cooked al dente, because of the hardness of the pasta. But only I find the carbonara was not too bad. My family failed the pasta dishes. For asian soup of the day, the duck soup was plain taste.

The saving grace of the dinner was foie gras. Any dishes (steamed egg, sushi, pan seared) with foie gras were good. Thankfully a stay with the hotel entitled us 50% of the bill. Will not go back again if the food menu / price remains."
Nice buffet with fast service,"Although its now a A la carte buffet due to convid situation the service is very fast as they assign 1 waiter for every 4 tables so its not hard to order. One thing they should consider changing is the usage of paper order forms which is very messy and inconvenient, But overall experience is great. Lobster night was very worth it as well."
Wide variety of food,"A very nice buffet, however due to covid-19, it changed to ala-carte in which we don't really eat much as we need to order and the service staff send it over to our table."
Wagyu night !,"Service

you’ll see many comments on the service but let’s be real honest this is unique times hence unique buffet situations. You’ll need to order to a server or off paper passed to a server. The food may come fast or slow but that’s also the demands of a kitchen (if it were a normal buffet you’d just be standing in line anyway).

Considering they were 100% full on the Thursday night I went I still got my food whilst hot. All / almost all smiling when food is delivered but hey it’s COVID and it was 100% capacity so let’s be more understanding.

Food

food was good and fresh no issues

- we went on Thursday Wagyu night. Black pepper Wagyu + beef sushi was great ! The pan fried Wagyu hit and miss but again full house it’s not gonna w perfect
- seafood fresh no issues all tasty
- chawamushi very tasty I had 3
- carbs I had the risotto I think more miss here then hit. To be honest we were there for the seafood and beef
- wanted to hit the Indian food but was too full !
- had the coconut ice cream (good) to finish the plate and leave refreshed !

again you’ll see comments on fresh or not but let’s face it most were there 1 for 1 credit card promos so it’s about 60++ per person for a very solid buffet up there with any other in Singapore. You know how much to pay for fine dining freshest sashimi in Singapore so manage your own expectations"
"Food ok, service is so-so","Went for the dinner buffet. Salmon sashimi was good (seems like they serve wild instead of farmed salmon), oyster was ok, the cold clams and scallops were ok, but the crab legs were salty. The beef cubes were almost flavourless as if they were not marinated, but the chili crab sauce with mantou and foie gras were good. Every order of the foie gras took a long time to serve, and it comes in bite sizes on either a slice of bread or radish.

Food in general is ok, but the service experience was less than pleasant. We were served by a gentleman (didn't get his name) who were attentive to us all the time but we felt sort of pressured throughout the meal as he hardly put on a smile, and was constantly looking (or scrutinizing?) at us perhaps to see if we needed to place more orders. We were also given (not part of our orders) the same plate of foie gras rejected by the table next to us, which we didn't mind because we waited very long for ours. As we were finishing the dinner, a third plate of foie gras came (we didn't order for it). The gentleman was busy with other tables so we waited about 5 minutes before telling him we didn't place an order for it. He then offered the plate of foie gras to the 2 tables next to us which we felt was kind of unprofessional.

Also, there was no attempt to explain the menu or recommendations. Overall we feel the dining experience is fine, but the service crew lacks sincerity and interpersonal touch."
Buffet lunch @ Triple Three,"Sumptuous lunch with good variety of food selection.
Sashimi like Tuna, Amber Jack & Salmon are good choices.
Asian delicacies like laksa & chicken rice are delicious."
Great food and highly attentive service staff!,"We visited Mandarin Orchard Triple Three restaurant on August 21st for the first time since it re-opened after the Circuit Breaker period. The buffet format has been changed to ordering our food via order slips, and even though we were not used to it, the service staff were patient and attentive to us throughout the evening. The food quality remains excellent, especially the teppanyaki beef and baked lobster, and the fresh oysters were large and sweet. We wish to especially thank Executive Sous Chef William Tan who made special arrangements for us and also came out to check on our table despite his busy work. His personal touch had made it a truly enjoyable dining experience for our family. Thank you Chef William!"
Quality buffet with friendly staffs,"I have been patronage Triple 3 for lunch or dinner buffet even with some special events to hold there. Reason that they provides high quality foods with friendly service. Especially the team of chefs are well leaded by Executive Chef Mr.William Tan, he had done a good job by keeping the best image of Triple 3 in the F & B industries . I definitely will recommended Triple 3 to all patronage who love food.
Keep it up Chef William Tan !!"
Awesome Lunch,"Sommelier Samri Buang, exceeded our expectation, being so accommodating. We had so much fun talking to Executive Chef William Tan too. He was most warm and welcoming. He got us truly excellent Pepper beef cubes, Wok-Fried Slipper Lobster and delicious chilli crab pasta! Uncle Cooper gave us very attentive service too! God bless his sweet soul. We will definitely be back for more... Thank you Triple Three!"
"Good buffet lunch at MandarinOrchard, Triple Tree restaurant.","We just had a very sumptuous lunch at Triple Tree at MandarinOrchard hotel. We are pleasantly delighted that the buffet lunch was good with a good variety of selection ranging from fresh sashimi, pasta, tempura, local delicacies.. the food quality is good, presentation is excellent & service standard is good !"
Worth every dollar,"During phase 2, buffets are all operating on an ala carte basis, but even still I actually find this style much better than taking the food ourselves, the waiters were very attentive to our needs, food came out quite promptly, and needless to say majority of the food (save for a few) were delicious. Especially since there is a 1 for 1 promotion going on right now, the price is quite affordable. It was my birthday and a waiter even came out with a birthday cake for me at the end which was a pleasant surprise! However I would just like to note that the dessert options could be better and I was slightly disappointed to know that the only drinks we could have without paying extra (like wine etc) were water, tea and coffee. Otherwise, 5 stars for every other aspect of the dining experience :)"
Good quality but lack of variety,"Right now due to phase 2, thus the restaurant did ala-carte buffet. Very good quality for their cold crabs and prawns and oysters. The rest of the dishes are of little selection and taste ok only. Disappointed with the quality of dessert, I think bengawan solo taste better. But overall, for 1 for 1 price, it’s still worth it due to the good seafood quality."
Best dining experience I had in Orchard!,"My friend and I went to Triple Three as we are celebrating my friend’s birthday. Amidst this Covid-19, we still want to celebrate and have a good time. The food is great, the variety suits my cravings also with a nice ambiance too. Safety measures are implemented but the staff remains friendly. To add on, I would like to commend Jocelyn of Triple Tree, for being so friendly and attentive especially for serving a slice cake for my friend’s birthday. Awesome effort! She did well in looking after our table, well mannered and approachable at the same time. We really appreciate her service. Definitely will come back again!"
Fantastic Weekday dinner,"Waitress was very prompt in clearing the plates for us, good customer service. There are quite a variety of foods particularly salmon and beef was awesome. Overall great experience."
"Excellent, with great personal touch","Probably one of the best buffet I had in Singapore. Had this for a birthday celebration. Upon billing, the staff at the counter actually mentioned that they have my birthday cake waiting to be served. Obviously the ""self entitled"" people who paid hundreds of dollars for this meal will complain and say why didn't they inform before hand regarding the birthday cake.

For me, I did not pay the hundred over dollars to just be served the birthday cake. The actual fact that the restaurant bothered to prepare one was the biggest indication that this restaurant knows how to provide the personal touch. I was too full to eat the cake anyway.

The spread of the buffet was good, and the quality of the food was excellent too. We had it on a Tuesday but I did not try any of the special themed dish. will be back again very soon to try on other days of the week.

All I can say is, keep it up Triple Three. It was a good job done (at least for me)."
A pleasant dinner at Triple Three,"A wide range of food and cakes. Oysters and sashimi are fresh and tasty Staff are friendly ... The service at the restaurant is good. If there is no promotion or discount , $88++ is abit too Forgotten to capture some pic for u all"
Anniversary Celebration,"Samri sommelier & Tony have never failed to enthrall us with their warmth, sincere & 5Star service right from the start of our dining experience.
They are a great assets to the company.
We will definitely be back"
Not good value for money,"Not the usual spread we expect at Triple Three. For the food quality served at lunch, could have gotten the same quality at lower price."
Sunday Seafood Lunch Buffé,"My wife & I had a 3 weeks vacation in Manila & 1 week in Singapore last January 2020. In Singapore, we stayed at the city center, Mandarin Orchard Hotel, Orchard Road. We had a very nice & memorable stay in this hotel among which is a Sunday International & Seafood Lunch at The Triple Three Restaurant, on the 5th Floor, Main Lobby of the Main Tower Section of the hotel. We had our Sunday lunch buffé on January 26, 2020.
The personnel are very professional, respectfull & helpful. There was a very impressive wide variety of fresh Seafood including fresh oysters, fried Lobster, etc, Sushi, Sashimi, sallad, different steaks including Wagyu Beef Steak, Chinese & Indian Cuisine & fruits, desserts, cakes, etc. The buffé costs 105 Singapore Dollars per person. Highly recommendable."
love the japanese section,"japanese section was good. the beef was so tender, shrimp tempura was tasty too. seafood section has a good variety. desserts, yummy.. chocolate mousse...delish !"
Poor value,Food variety is very poor compared to other hotel buffets. The prawn tempura was quite awful. Full of batter with soggy prawns. Only the fried rice was nice. The seafood selection was poor too. Will definitely not be back unless they cut their pricing by 50% (value I think is worth). Not worth it at all.
Disappointed,The standard of the food and the varieties is no good. Chosen triple three as my birthday lunch cos we remember the food there is nice! Feeling disappointed!
Limited Food Options and Crowded,"Went for a Saturday Lunch and was disappointed by the food spread. Seafood spread was really limited with no crabs or oysters. Also had to queue up to get the sashimi slices, of which they only give you 4 slices per portion...
Really way to expensive for this spread presented.
There was a quite a crowd during that time so we had to queue for most of the food and staff at the cooking counters were running low on patience too.

Custard bun was nice though, but wouldn't pay this amount just to eat custard buns."
Great food and great offer,"Temperatures were recorded at the lobby to safeguard everyone. The restaurant was clean and spacious, ambience was great. The spread/variety was well balanced with the quality of food. My favorites are: poached egg, tuna sushi/sashimi, aburi scallop topped with roe, assorted tempura and to top it off the haagen daas ice cream. The UOB promo made it very worth it for the quality of food."
Come here for Wagyu and Foie Gras,Been here a few times and they have never disappointed. Check their website for their daily special. I love it that they have a different type of wagyu for their customers!
Clean environment and excellent service,"I made reservation through the restaurant manager, Ms Mani. She was prompt and efficient and reserved a long table for the 12 of us for our annual work plan lunch. No deposit was required for the reservation and she confirmed with me one day before the actual date.

It was a 1 for 1 promotional offer when we made payment with our DBS credit card. The nett total charge for the weekend buffet lunch for the 12 of us amounted to $550.85, The nett charge for one pax is $45.90/-. A very reasonable price.

The restaurant is located within a prime location of Orchard Road at the 5th floor of the grand Mandarin Orchard Hotel. Complimentary 3-hr parking coupon is given for every $100/- spent. Thus, we were entitled 5 complimentary parking coupons since our bill added up to $550.85. Without the complimentary parking coupon, the driver would have to fork out more than $10/- for the 3-hr parking at Mandarin Orchard car park.

There was temperature taking at the lift lobby of the hotel when we arrived. We took the lift to the 5th level where the restaurant was located and was surprised to see a long queue of customers outside the restaurant. The menacing threat of the Coronavirus outbreak seem not to have affected the restaurant business. Bottles of hand sanitizers were visibly found on the counters of the hotel and at the cashier restaurant counter.

The restaurant impressed me with a sparkling clean layout and cozy setting. The air-con temperature and the warm lighting were just right for our interaction and chit chat.

The Indian food section attracted me with her varieties of curry dishes. Masala curry, the Mutton Kofta Curry, the Prawn Masala and the Bhindi Masala. Once in the stomach, these food seem to invigorate my digestive juices and I found that they were very well cooked and sumptuous.

The next section that attracted me was the sushi section. The salmon and tuna slices were tender. The soft tender salmon slices seem to melt with a great taste as I munched them in my mouth. But I found the cold crab meat not very appetizing or meaty. I still preferred the fresh beef steak with her tender meat.

The herbal Bak Kut Teh noodle soup was unique and was delicious. The steamed Cod fish in Hong Kong style lack the tenderness and appeared not of superior grade.

We were debating if the Coronavirus will spread with cold seafood. Food cooked at high temperature would have rendered the virus dead during the cooking but even cold food infected with the virus would have been destroyed by the stomach juices if it enters the digestive system.

The issue is contamination on the utensils used by the various customers and if the contaminated hands touch the face or nose, it then will allow the virus to enter the delicate nasal membrane or through the eyes. My advice would be to use the hand sanitzers to clean our hands after we touch those utensils.

The Green bean soup was well praised by my members. Not so sweet and full of healthy ingredients - the sweet potato, green beans, yam, etc. The iced cucumber lemonade and the Honey & Calamansi Iced tea were our favorite beverages.

For my vegetarian friend, she like the mushroom and fresh broccoli and the various fruits. At the cake section were the blackforest cake, Raspberry cake, pineapple tart, rainbow cake, coconut tart but I only filled my mouth with the walnuts and could not stomach more.

Compared to the diversified wide range of food you can find at Lime Shangrila or Carousel Royal Plaza, the range carried here at this restaurant is quite limited but the niche is in the way they cook it hot and warm and present it fresh. This is especially valuable during this Coronavirus period when the focus would be on the preparation of the food.

The waitress who served our table deserved a word of praise. She was very prompt in taking away our used plates and bowls. She was wearing a mask and she was courteous and helpful.

Thanks for the great service. We will come again!"
Excellent Chefs at 333 restaurant,"Excellent Chefs at 333 restaurant ., especially chef William , chef Sunny & chef Awado. We loved to dine at 333 restaurant, the chefs in the restaurant had very good customer service with the customer.
Last night my husband and myself had our dinner at the restaurant. Meet Chef William on our way into restaurant, my husband informed him that the Coronavirus is looming round better not consume too much raw food. The few chefs immediately prepared a few cooked seafood for us. Chef William personally brought out baked oyster, baked lobster & baked fish cheek as well as a bowl of Laksa for us and he sat with us on the table to have a chat on our concerned over the virus. Had also getting feedbacks on their food.

Looking forward to dine at this restaurant again. Thank you so much for the good service to us."
Good and excellent service,With quality food and wonderful service and a list of programs. Thumb up. The staff provides wonderful service.
Amazing night at triple three,Thank you triple three for accommodating us last min. It was wonderful dinner date we spend there. I love the food too much and thank you to pastry chefs making so many delicious desserts.. I diffently will come more to Triple three. Staff was amazing and thank you to hostess provide a seat with view. Only thing I want to highlight here you should put more professional staff who make all arrangements for reservation there was girl Anisah she was not sure with anything. When I asked her she informed she is just part timer not from t3. But I ignore the conversation I had with her not very pleasant the second time staff was nice so I believe you will look into it. Rest everything was fine food delicious just as reservation making its first platform should be more sensible and good knowledge staff.serving staff was so nice. I want to share teppanyaki station was very nice seafood was so fresh and Indian food is very delicious too. Thank you for everything. Hope to see you soon

Triple Three Buffet at Mandarin Hotel Orchard,"The fresh oysters which is one of the highlights were extremely fresh. It is as if we were eating it just after they have been caught. There are also mouthwatering fresh or cooked seafood like prawns, crayfishes crabs. The choice of food is similar or close to what was offered at Carousel.

Overall good experience but seating arrangement could be better as we have to squirrel in and out to get out food due to tight spacing. Will only visit once in a while due to high price."
Chistmas dinner,"i had 4 buffets over the past 2 weeks for Christmas dinners with friends and colleagues (Brasserie Les Saveurs @ St Regis, Edge @ Pan Pacific, The Three Peacocks @ Labrador, Colony @ Ritz Carlton). So comparison between all these 4 are inevitable. I would say that Triple Three wasn't the worst among all, but definitely not the best.

I went to Triple Three on a Saturday evening. Variety wise, it pales in comparison to Colony and Edge. Quality was fine, but not fantastic. There were a few good choices though, like the lobster, wagyu beef and tempura prawn. Apart from those, nothing else really impressed me. Cold seafood bar is normal, no wow factor. Dessert variety and quality was average. And sadly, the buffet does not include juices like Colony and Edge. Service needs improvement, I had to walk to the service staff to request for water to be served at the table, and that was after being there for more than 30 mins. And plates do take a while to be cleared.

In a nutshell, ""average"" would probably be the best word to describe my experience this round. I've been here twice. Although this place is not my highly recommended choice, I will still recommend ppl who have not tried it before, after all it isn't that bad (if you have not tried the best). But I won't be visiting there any sooner, probably till i run out of buffet places again. And hopefully there will be improvement by then."
Great food,International buffet for lunch. Food was great and service was awesome. Me and my friend surely will come back again soon.
Best Xmas Dinner Ever,"Congratulations Triple three u guys really made our night wonderful really wonderful evening spent during last night xmas Eve at Triple three. Came with friends party excellent service and delicious food ever. Seems like Triple three is doing alot better already than others. Teppanyaki station chef and carving station and Indian station chefs are so nice smile and serve very good food. Understand its very crowded but really good food is the reason why its so crowded. Xmas Eve package was so awesome enjoy very well with drinks. We feel really welcoming when everything taken care by service staff sorry couldn’t get her name and hostess girl Prabh done wonderful job specially came to ask is everything fine on the table. Are we really enjoying??? Marvellous!!!They are all so busy but really impressed they still check on whether guest enjoying,, Beef dishes and turkey and ham was really awesome. Staff look so much in festive mood alll were very happy. Good table and good service and awesome food . Mr Samri bar man thank you for drinks really prompt service. So once again thank you so much for last night. Really impressed!!!!!"
"Good food, service need to be improved.","Overall the food was great. There is a lot of varieties for the wagyu beef. Sashimi and seafood was fresh. Turkey, ham and roast beef were quite nice as well.

However, the service need to be improved. When I made the booking, I specifically asked for two high chairs. As I arrived, there was no high chairs ready at the dinning table. The staff still need to get it and wait for me to help them to replace the chairs, without even a thank you at the end. Overall service attitude from the staff was not that friendly feeling as well judging by the tone and face expression. At the end of the dinner, even I only had 3 adults and two small kids on the table all the time, the bill came in with a price for 4 adults. As a premium five-star hotel buffet at the well-known shopping district, I would not have expected such kind of service along the way."
Company Year End Lunch - 2nd year here,"We are attended by a very meticulous staff, Ms Wanny. She introuduced herself & welcomed us with warm greetings. Ms Wanny is very attentive & observant.
She has given us her professional services to the whole lot (42 paxs) of us.
She will make sure our used dishes are cleared & our glasses filled.
Sending lemon water right away after we de-shelled our prawns before we having to look around for napkins.
We are happy to have her with us!"
Staff were very friendly and a vast selection of food and desserts. Wagyu was very nice and come in lots of varieties,"Staff were very friendly and a vast selection of food and desserts. Wagyu was very nice and come in lots of varieties (especially the stir fried wagyu). However, the scallop sashimi ran out very quickly (buffet starts at 1830h, scallop sashimi ran out at 1930h), might need to prepare more."
Unable to contact restaurant,"Was there for a birthday dinner with family and wanted to request for a simple cake. Tried calling the restaurant multiple times, the day before and on the day itself but never had anyone picking up my call, not even once, horrible ! They seriously need to look into their service on this because what if customers need to make amendments to their booking and they can't get to anyone.
Food selection was not fantastic but quality is there."
Happy tummies; room for improvement on service team,"+ Food quality was excellent
+ Food variety was great
+ Presentation and atmosphere was clean and pleasant

- Communications across staff team was unfortunately poor. Don't get me wrong - they were not rude. A surprise guest was intended to join the dinner, and it has been explicitly mentioned to the receptionist upon welcome. However, they still busted the surprise intended for the birthday celebration evening due to the lack of communication across the staffs. Had there been a small message conveyed to the ground staff helping us at our table, it wouldn't have had been let out of the bag before the intended sequence of event.

So nothing devastating, just that the experience would have been complete and superb if the surprise went as conveyed and planned."
Great lunch with family in Triple Three,"My family enjoyed the spread of seafood, sashimi and teppanyaki food items the best. The service was good as well, constant clearing of plates without being too intrusive. Ambience was great, music not too loud and it was cosy enough for the family. Value for money, with a 1-4-1 promotion on credit card."
Review,"Buffet was good , great staffs that helped me and my girlfriend alot along the way to our table and also i would like to shoutout to one staff however not sure what his name is , a male student age wearing spectacles . He was swift in clearing the tables and also offering his services to us like how when we wanted to go for a smoke break , despite his busy schedule , he offered to go off route and take us to the smoking room . The food selection was okay , seafood was fresh and i loved the size of the oysters plus crab leg and everything had a good outstanding taste . However was expecting a wider spread for the price paid . Overall it was a good buffet and i would go back again :)"
1st time here and craving for fresh oysters,"It was a nice evening with a good table which we can view outside orchard busy streets.food variety are great was nice and fresh ..I love the dessert ice cream sticks w mango flavor .

Service were fast and friendly!
Oh ya there is free fresh coconut juice on this day !"
Corporate Lunch Buffet,We would like to extend our gratitude to Prabh for her excellent service. Our company recently had 3 events with Triple Three for more than 150 pax each. Prabh was very accommodating and helpful to ensure our event went on smoothly. Our guests had a wonderful experience thanks to her hospitality. The restaurant carries great selection of variety and quality. We will definitely choose Triple Three in the future for our company and personal event.
Not great,Staff doing admission was not pleasant. She sent away some because it was not 6.30pm but admitted a few others saying its exception. Food was v.average and huge fish was not cooked properly and needed to be taken in to be recooked. Overall poor experience
Foie gras Tuesday,Foie gras dishes are very nice! All the seafood i ate are very fresh! Highly recommended for dates or celebrations!
Lunch buffet,"Selection was not as good as before but the service is still good. The service staff, Sebastian and another young chap(Don’t know his name as he did not wear a name tag) attended to my table provided very good and professional service :)"
DISAPPOINTED,"I wrote a feedback to the outlet. I am a frequent diner to Triple Three. unfortunately this will be my last.
The food was cold at 8.15pm.when I started dining and the pasta adn risotto which was one of my groups favourite was a total disappointment.. No presentation.Was a lump of white rice dumped onto the plate for the risotto. ... the Oysters had a thick and milky muddy texture and not very fresh..Which caused my dairrhoea after the dinner.... OR maybe something else? On the whole , it was a disappointment for one of my favourite food places...."
Variety is getting little,Selection is poor compared to few years ago. Especially when my last visit was exactly a year ago. There were still oysters and crayfish etc but now you see lots of carb dishes instead. The seafood draw is no longer there.
Disappointing buffet lunch,"It was the most terrible hotel buffet I ever had. The spread was average.
The food: beef steak was dry and hard; the chef at the sashimi counter gave me such a full plate with huge chunk of sashimi that was cut so thick, does not look appetising at all and I immediately lost my appetite; pasta was just fry with too much oil and I felt like I'm drinking the olive oil instead; the soft serve yogurt has a weird after taste and the lists goes on.
The service: the waiter was carrying an unpleasant grouchy face through out. I needed to order wine and the waiter said ""you have to pay for this you know?"" Yes of course we know. We need to call them afew times to clear our plate or to get their attention.

It was a indeed a disappointing birthday lunch and I will definitely not recommend my friends and family there."
One that never disappoint.,"Been here 4 times for their wagyu Wednesday, never been disappointed, good spread good service. Going for fifth."
Not worth it unless one for one,"The seafood variety was too little, only prawns, mussels and clams. It is really not worth the money, even though seafood and sashimi were fresh. It is a nice gesture for the staff to sing a birthday song and provide a piece of cake for my mum at the end of our buffet, but we were not allowed to pack the piece of cake away. It is really a waste of food."
"Great food, wonderful service","Generally I don't like buffets as the quality is usually sacrificed, ""but!"" to my delight, Triple Three was excellent, but of course, at a price. Service crew were very diligent, but some of the chefs miserable, that's my only gripe."
lunch,thanks for the manager hairul for solving out the problem and giving us lots of info... he is very friendly and professional... the food was good... will bring more friend back to visit
Great Buffet Line Up,"I came here for dinner on a Saturday (2nd diner 50% off) and there was a good buffet line up. The highlights were the oysters and mentaiko lobsters, which always attract a queue. The sashimi and grilled meat were also fresh and nicely cooked respectively. However, there were not many drink options - only water and some hot drinks e.g. coffee and tea. Also note that the complimentary parking only lasts for 2 hours."
Our best meal on this trip to Singapore,Buffet dinner did not go overboard on endless variety. Instead it gave just the right selection to appeal to every palette. Focus on quality of ingredients combined with excellent culinary expertise made our dining experience a delight. Just the right type of lighting also allows the diner to see what he/she is eating without being exposed to any glare. Very attentive and prompt service left us wanting for nothing. Highly recommended for anyone with a healthy appetite!
Excellent lunch buffet,"Lunch buffet:
Cold Seafood selection: prawns, mussels, clams

Hot food: ham, roast rib eye beef tender,
Teppanaki chicken/salmon/veggies,
Made to order noodles, laksa, Indian food
Japanese: sushi, sashimi, stir fry meat/veggies

Dessert: ice cream, sweets, fruits
Coffee, tea"
pretty nice,has variety of selections. Food is nice. See food quite fresh. Beef taste fine as well. Worth to go again
"Touch-and-go in terms of variety, but decent quality","Positioned as an international buffet, Triple Three definitely met the expectations with the various cuisine types. If you are looking for an extensive spread, this probably will not wow you, as each cuisine types feature a few dishes. Nonetheless, trying each station will leave you full to the brim.

The biggest surprise was at the ice cream station, of which the cup-ice-creams were not what we expect from Triple Three. We certainly hope the team will relook at their choice of ice cream.

The most pleasant surprise was the service team's attention to detail, when they took the initiative to take notice of the diners' birth dates during booking and presented birthday cakes with the birthday song.

Giving an ""Average"" rating as we didn't have the feeling of revisiting based on what we experienced."
Wagyu Beef theme Buffet,"This was the Birthday dinner for my 9-yr-old boy. We enjoyed the wagyu beef dishes a lot, with top quality of beef and various ways of cooking it and all delicious. We loved the teppanyaki beef most as well as the wagyu beef sushi and sukiyaki. The spread of buffet was not big while the quality of food was good. Fresh seafood and friendly staff too. Would come back again."
Gastronomic buffet delight,"Recently we went to the Mandarin Orchard to savor the buffet there - Triple Three. We enjoyed it!
1. The buffet caters to most taste from International to Chinese, to Indian etc.
2. The seafood was really good and fresh.
3. The desserts served were both classical and special.
TIP 1 While this is a very good buffet, we would prefer the COLONY buffet(RitzCarlton) to Triple Three. The Colony is more expensive but contains a greater variety.
TIP 2 Sometimes Triple Three have special themes. It is worthwhile to check it out to before booking to make sure the special is to your taste."
buffet spread,quality of food (buffet spread) was superb however for the price paid there was not much variety and the taste was also average no wow factor kind of disappointed especially the sushi (genki sushi taste 10x better)
Not worth a visit,My first and last visit to this restaurant. Went during lunch. Food selection and quality were mediocre. Service was terrible. Not recommended.
Excellent Meal,"1)Excellent oysters spread washed and served individually.
2)pan fried beef cubes
3)overall good spread of food choices"
Just amazing,"We went there for sunday lunch. It is very crowded place to enjoy meal. Here and there other tables are celebrating their special day. But service crews are very professional and attentive. Furthermore food also good quality and chefs are every section so food served wonderfully.
Lobster is one of best and i loved spread. 1 for 1 deal is definitely worth it. Considee around 70nett per person to enjoy sunday meal at Mandarin Orchard."
"Well, best breakfast (among three places) to have if you are hotel guest","I usually stay at Club floor and always find out that this is the best places (food items, more variety) than other places (Chatter Box and Top of the M)"
LOBSTER NIGHT ON A SATURDAY,"Went there with my folks in July & August; both on Saturdays!

It was a lobster night but why the serving was limited and the unnecessary queue made it difficult for everyone to get their share of the lobsters.

Paying a premium price hoping to have a glimpse of the lobsters disuaded me from making a need to hoover around in hope to get one.

Suggest that the servers can go around every table (or some sort of arrangement so that every one has at least one) to check how many they wanted then sending to them or get them to collect when ready."
Good customer experience,"The buffet spread is good and the customer experience esp for families with kids is better, with magician and balloonist to keep the kids and adults entertained. Had an enjoyable lunch."
Lunch Buffet,Food is really fresh. But not a lot of varieties thou. Not really worth the price although it’s already 1-1. But the waiter/waitress are really very friendly. We are celebrating my dad’s birthday and they gave us a complimentary cake for celebration.
Celebration for Wife birthday,"Went for the credit card 1 for 1 lunch promo. I must say it’s worth the price for the food and the service. Service friendly older workers whose attitude is good with smiles always. Requested a slice of cake with candle for the celebration and the staffs are able to time the birthday song for my wife perfectly near to the end of the buffet meal. Thumbs up for the requested service as my wife is caught by surprise! Recommend for couples with kids for the lunch buffet.

Excellent service for a buffet; fresh seafood,"The buffet emphasised fresh seafood and choice meats (weekends are now about snow crab and oysters, as many as you want, and plenty to go around even with those kinds of customers who hog the oyster bar). The lobster thermidor was succulent and very fresh. Dessert selection was disappointing but expected given how much of the budget went to seafood.

Service was excellent - plates cleared away promptly and finger bowls appeared magically after I helped myself to crab, without any need for prompting. Must commend the staff for helpfully rearranging seating on request to locate us at an area where an elderly family member did not have to walk up a slope to reach the buffet line.

Excellent overall. Will be back again."
Good Service and Ambience,"We went for the Saturday evening dinner buffet (lobster Mentaiko is the usual highlight dish).
Reservations were retrieved swiftly and we were seated at our table quickly. Restaurant was comfortable and well-appointed. Waiting staff were attentive and polite, prompt in clearing used dishes and attended quickly to requests. Service was professional and good - thumbs up!

Buffet spread was not the most elaborate nor wide compared to the other hotels, but dishes were well cooked and presented. Live cookings stations were well placed for easy access and view. Of note, the beef steak cubes at the teppanyaki station was exceptional - tasty, tender, juicy and moreish. Fresh oysters were plump and slithery-smooth, briny and deeply savoury. Sashimis however paled in comparison - salmon belly, salmon and tuna were rather insipid tasting, tuna dry while salmon soggy. The star dish, lobster mentaiko, was ok, not too different from the regular lobster with torched toppings.

Other cooked food - Japanese tempura live station (not bad), indian food (good naan), etc.

Drinks - iced water, coffee and brewed tea

Desserts - few fruit choices (regular breakfast stuffs - ie. melon, watermelon, pineapple, etc.) average cakes, soft serve & ice cream sticks.

Overall, ok for a place with cosy ambience and good service, and above average quality food."
"Quick service, high quality food","Staff cleared the dirty plates quickly, offered water to guests upon seating us. Lobsters served on Fri night were good. Oysters fresh and shucked in front of you."
Positive review,"Food are good but variety somehow little
Service average, as I was wait for almost 1 hour for the cold cut server to cut the meat, but not sure why he’s not around. I asked others for it but they say wait for in charge to come back. Wondering why other chef cannot do so. Some chef at the counter don’t show their professionlism as one of them will scold his junior for not working. Facial expression very unhappy while serving.
Overall I thing the service needed to be improve, as however Orchard Mandarin is a high class hotel. Not complaining just provide feedback only.
Nonetheless, I will definitely go back again. Food is excellent. Thank you"
Not a good outing,"First, the food is too salty. Soup, steaks, pasta, local hawker food has too much salt in it.
The chef at the sashimi station literally drop the food into plate right before your eyes. It maybe ok if you are at a hawker stall or food court, but this is a restaurant in a 5 star hotel. I felt I was in a canteen..."
Peruvian fare,"Flavours of Peru was in town, lots of delicacies - Pisco sour (cokctail), ceviche, Peruvian chicken rice, pork ribs, chowder, and lots of desserts. Thank you Triple Three for bringing South American food here."
Food is not worth $95 per pax,"Went on a Friday night, DBS card holder has 50% discount on second diner. Each pax comes up to $95.

For $95 (on par with colony at Ritz Carlton), I expect great variety and quality food. After looking at the selection, it was a big disappointment.

Seafood on ice have mediocre selection, with extremely thin and small snow crab leg. Most of the food i tasted was super salty and I the only drink I had was plain water. The the only highlight of my dinner was the teppanyaki beef cubes, grilled asparagus and green tea popsicle, which is really pathetic if you think of it.

- No juice
- No soft drinks
- Seafood ice bar have NO king crab legs, NO lobsters (for $95 per pax I expect better seafood)
- Dessert section only have a few cakes and puddings
- Tempura section can totally skip (not sure why the counter was even there for)
- Dim sum only had har gow and ... (i can't even remember cause its not memorable at all)
- Prawns and vegetable stir fry was so salty, prawn was big but texture like rubber
- Indian section food was cold and looks like an abandon city
- Mentaiko lobster was mediocre as well. Had some fishy smell to it.
- Grilled scallop was salty but truffle mash was good.

I never had such disappointing hotel buffet experience before and will never return. I would rather spend my money on other places much much better than triple three."
Disappointing experience,"Celebrate special day with my son. Was disappointed with the selection of all food & drinks. It’s good only if you drink- there served free flow of beer.
For non drinker, you only have plain water, dilute coffee or a long standing bitter tea- English breakfast only. No soft drinks or juices around.
Tapanyaki corner, only 2 meat & 1 veggie
Roster corner, only 3 selections
Cold cuts, limited options
Chilled seafood , prawns, Vetnum crab, lar lar, oyster & green muscle
Sashimi only 4 varieties
Indian corner, lots of carbo from bread to salty rice
Pasta are too salty
Tim sum corner only 3 verities
Dessert are all variety of cakes only, no waffles, crepes, tarts, pie...
2 types of soft serve with cheap topping , no chocolate sauce around
Simple fruits are served
My 1st and for sure my last to visit .
Don’t recommend at all.
Food are usually tasteless or salty!"
Buffet Lunch Triple Tree Mandarin Orchard,"Had great lunch. Good ambience. Have vegetarian Indian food along with Non Vegetarian.
Chefs are great and will help out with selection.
Do try Vegetarian curries, dhal , naan."
Worth going for the next time,"This was not the first time to triple 3 for the buffet dinner . The quality and variety of food are still in good standard . Love the sashimi , beef , lobster , desert especially the ice cream , the cheese range etc . Worth going back again ."
Wonderful Place to Dine,"Good service from the ground crew and live station chef. Nice and friendly. Food is great as well, all the seafood were fresh and taste wonderful.

Value for money considering the location, service and food options available!"
fantastic range,"greeted with good service, staff are efficient and always clear empty plates :-) the food is great and there is a lot of variety. i think it’s worth for the price and highly recommend the beef cubes and tempura!!"
Excellence service,"Went there this afternoon to celebrate my girl’s birthday. The food varieties were average. However, the credit card promotion of 1 for 1 buffet lunch was reasonable. The thing that I would like to give 5 stars was the service by the staff name Wenny, if I remembered correctly. She was extremely attentive. Not only did she cleared the empty plates on time, she was even so attentive that she brought me warm lemon water to rinse my hand when she saw me using them to unshell the prawns. Wow, I was impressed. These are the services which will definitely bring me back to them. Big applause for having them in your team."
