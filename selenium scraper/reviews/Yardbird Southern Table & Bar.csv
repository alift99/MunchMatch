Consistently good!,"This is our ‚Äúgo to‚Äù restaurant at MBS. Food is great, ambiance is perfect. Love their chicken!
Excellent customer service, the staff are very attentive to your needs. Special mention to their Assistant GM Jonathan Comia for consistently giving us 5 star service and he is very hands-on to his customers."
Average,"The Yardbird is fine, no great and definitely not bad. Limited menu choice for a restaurant claiming to be American and I'm sure there must be better alternatives in Singapore."
Great food and service,"Went with my family for diner. Reservation was easy and ambience was great. Good variety on the menu. Portions are big, it's good to share. Great drinks offered too."
VERY CONSISTANT,"The food, the service the experience is ALWAYS over the top! I have strict food allergies which makes it very difficult to dine out but not at Yardbird. They really listen to and comply with what I want which makes it so sorry to eat there.

Thank you Yardbird"

Enjoyable dining exp at Yardbird.,A restaurant that offers great choice of ambience - outdoor with CBD view or quiet indoor aircon. The food servicing is of good portion and quality. Cocktail and beer are pretty good too.
EXCELLENT SERVICE AT YARDBIRD,The service by staff Wee Ping is immaculate! He sure knows what service quality means. Thank you very much.
Must try - fried chicken and waffles with spiced watermelon,Superb fried chicken and waffles with spiced watermelon! Repeat patron. Remember to have their chicken with their in house bourbon maple syrup and hot sauce. Their crab cakes were good too. Good to make reservations as they can get quite packed on weekends especially.
Mr,Fresh experience and good food and environment Friendly and helpful staffs with good recommendation Restaurant also easily accessible and with indoor and outdoor setting
Nice ambience and great food,First time visiting Yardbird after seeing so many good reviews. The ambience is very nice and staff are friendly. Ordered their popular Chicken n Watermelon n Waffles and the Lobster Mac & Cheese. Both taste good! Overall a great experience!
Very Dissapointing,"I am dissapointed, we went on Xmas Eve for dinner. I had a 9pm reservation and was happy to start dinner.

Food was good I must say, the floor staff service average but they tried. I do know that it was xmas eve and it was hectic and busy for staff (that is why you open a restaurant business right?) but here is why we were dissapointed- the entire time we had our meal and conversation there was one kitchen staff shouting at the top of his voice the orders, and it echoed in the dining area, we could barely have a decent conversation.

Wait, you will say kitchen is noisy.

Which kitchen is not?I dine out a lot, I do not hear other kitchen staff yelling non-stop at other places.

We raised it with the waitress, she just smiled, thinking it was funny.

Anyway, such is life."
Good dining place,Good food and friendly staff. Enjoyed the dining experience and we loved the environment. Drinks are good as well
Great Chicken and a good selection of Bourbon,"This was not our first time, and it was as good as ever. It's a great spot to enjoy good quality food with friends over some drinks. We were there for a bout 4 hours and enjoyed every minute."
Outstanding chicken,"Loved the chicken, and also the other adult-friendly and kid-friendly options. Biscuits and cornbread are also great."
Lunch with the kids,Quality comfort food in quality environment. Never disappoints and the staff today was attentive and very responsive. Highly commendable.
Bday lunch,"Another great experience at Yardbird! F&B were great, but service was even better! Well done and keep it going!"
Yardbird,Good experience with friendly staff! Love the ambience and food was great too. Will come back again for sure!
Perfect night,Visited for friend's birthday- always love their signature great American burger but decided to try out barramundi and tea braised beef. It's as tasty as any other favorite! It's gonna be challenging what to order for my next visit!
Business Dinner,"Good service, professional, thanks. Food presentation was great, quality is good. There is even a separate vegan with a lot of choices."
"Ambience, large selection of drinks","Come here for the ambience, service and drinks. Food wise, it is‚Ä¶ at best okay for me. Nothing to shout or rave about or win awards for. chocolate cake sounds better than the taste - too rich."
"Excellent food, attentive service","Excellent food, attentive service. We opt for the Tasting menu, it was awesome. The staff, Ikhlak was attentive. Thanks."
Anniversary Dinner,This is my first visit and many more to come. Food was scrumptious and services was excellent. I would recommend dining at this place. They made my day so special.
Mr,"Very courteous staff and nice food, will come back again lots of good food to chose from nice ambience staff very patient and we can feel like dinning a great experience with many variety of food to choose from"
Yardbird,"Mylene and her team always make sure my visit is memorable and joyful one. Yardbird is my first choice restaurant at MBS to host my guests or family event and each visit comes with good surprises as well as laughter and cheers.
Not forgetting the food and drinks which I‚Äôll order without browsing through menu because the staffs know what I want. Well done Yardbird team and keep up the ‚Äúachieving excellency‚Äù service!

Thanksgiving,"Food and Service were both excellent!! We opted for the Thanksgiving set menu and it did not disappoint. The turkey was juicy, and all the sides were traditional to what you would cook at home in the U.S."
Top American Cuisine,"A lovely restaurant with great staff and amazing food. Surprisingly big quantities for good prices, which I was not expecting in Marina Bay Sands."
Watermelon chicken and waffles!,"Ate here on a family birthday celebration. Food was absolutely amazing. It is on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. We had the famous chicken with waffles, a steak and also ordered the lobster mac n cheese. The food and service were unparalleled and impeccable. Only con was the fact that although my rewards card was taken by the waiter but in the end no points were added. Unfortunately I was too trusting and never checked till a week later and by then receipt had already been thrown and it was too much of a hassle to go back and ask for it."
Birthday celebration,Service was good and food did not fail us. We enjoyed our time there. If could suggest something for birthday girl would be perfect.
The best new #1 place to dine in Singapore,"Yardbird prodly attest to itself as setving the best fried chicken in Singapore. A tall order considering we are well-served by the hordes of korean fried chicken as well as texas fried chicjen, kfc, jolibee etc.

We were well taken off by Nicolas, the jovial GM who came by our table a few times during the evening to check how our dinner was going on etc...perfect example of his sunny Spanish temperament.

We ordered the house favourites of fried chicken waffles & watermelon, american big burger, smoked ribs, truffle chicken, butter lettuce with grilled mango, grilled brussels sprouts, french fried with bscon salt and finished with fried oreo ice cream and gigantic bacon choc cake.

First warning - the portions are American-sized.
2nd warning - the fried chicken are really really good...esp at first few bites. But have to eat them fast as the batter doesnt take too kindly to our humidity but it was crispy, super-flavourful and indeed a winner. The waffles were not the crispy kind, more doughy than what we liked but the bourbon maple syrup was smoky with a strong hint of bourbon...
The smoked ribs came with its own smokey theatrics, but the American apple wood smoke was just heavenly. The ribs were of OMG standard, literally falling off the bone. Coated in the sweet sticky savoury sauce, it was wiped off the plate. 8 ribs gone in no time.
The American burger came fully loaded with 2 huge beef patties plus a smoked pork belly layered tall and mighty with cheese, lettuce condiments etc. As good as any gourmet burger out there.
The truffle chicken was also huge and smelt amazing but compared to the fried chicken, the fried chicken easily trumped. The grilled bussels sprouts (for someobe qho abhores it) was also smokey, crisp and delicious.

We were curious how does savoury bacon fit into dessert. But this was no ordinary fried bacon. Bacon that has been candied in honey, fried to a crispy brownish black and sitting tall on tip of a decadent choc layered cake abt 12 inches tall. This is a family sized slice of cake. 4 of us couldnt even finish half of this sinful but utterly delicious cake.

This has been an amazing dining experience at this unique restaurant. Away from the usual Jap gourmet places or korean bbq or even plain vanilla michellin degustation menu. This Southern American cuisine is hearty, delicious and a totally unique offering. Fantastic food plus first class service with an amazing classy ambience, this gets our vote as 2022 best new #1 restaurant to eat in Singapore. Nicolas runs a tight ship!. Kudos."
Worth the Walk in the Marina Bay Sands Mall for Great Food and Friendly People,"The Yardbird burger is American size and high on taste! The highlight for me was the buttermilk biscuits! So tasty! However, the best thing about our meal was the service, friendly, efficient and responsive. People were there to answer our questions, get our order and learn more about the food and pick up our plates they did it all! Amazing service led to an amazing experience!"
Happy Sisters Night,Our sisters night was so enjoyable. Great food and super nice ambience. Great and prompt service from Jonathan and team who ensured our night is more than pleasant. We will definitely go back again soon ! Thank you.
Lovely Birthday Celebration,"My friend made a reservation @ 9pm for 4pax, however we are 45 mins early. The friendly lady manager ( Hazel ) quickly accomodated us a table upstairs outside ( thankfully good weather too ) , overlooking the amazing view and settled us down for a table of 5. Kudos to Ruzzle and Jonathan who ensured our celebration was a great one for that 2 hours before we head to marquee ! Nonetheless , food was good and consistent, service was prompt and top notch . I‚Äôm simply glad they remembered tiny detail like a candle and words written happy bday including my name on the dessert plate ! Would love to go back again soon ! Thank you Ruzzle and Jonathan once again !"
Awesome service,I came to celebrate my fren's birthday and staff Ruban recommended awesome cocktails to us. We were very happy over his plesant service and his awesome recommendations of cocktails. Looking forward to come more often. Kudos to Ruban. Keep up the plesant service.
"Friendly and Attentive staff (Ikhlar), food is good",Have a pleasant evening at yard bird because of the staff Ikhlar. He is very attentive towards our order and he even go all out to make sure our order is good and even got us a birthday cake. His service is tremendous and highly recommended :)
Don't go in close to closing,"Got there after a long day as a walk in. The food here was very good and the service was good. When it was time to close they were pushing people to leave. I know what it is like because I worked in the industry for a long time, but never asked people to pay before they were done eating their meal."
Birthday Celebration at Yardbird,"Had a sumptuous meal at Yardbird to celebrate my mum‚Äôs birthday. Service was great and interior gave a Southern vibe true to its name. Needless to say, we left with full tummies and a full heart."
Delicious lunch,"Wonderful restaurant, staff was very friendly and helpful, great food and drink. Highly recommend. Also high quality for an affordable price. Will definitely return to Yardbird."
A pleasant surprise,"Ordered their signature Chicken ‚Äòn‚Äô Watermelon ‚Äòn‚Äô Waffles and really loved their spiced watermelon and bourbon infused maple syrup. The waffle was fluffy too. The chicken was really crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Cliche as it sounds but I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken but I really enjoyed it. We also ordered the Popcorn Shrimp and it was lovely. The popcorn was salted and buttery, it melts in your mouth, I finished everything even though I was really full.

I'm actually looking forward to head back there again to try other dishes."
Great food! Great service!,"Organised a private lunch event at level 1 for 30 pax. The food was excellent, and the service was efficient. Though the portions were quite large, but that's a good thing! Thank you to the team for doing such a good job, and a big thank you to Hazel, the restaurant manager who helped with the whole process (even when she was on leave) from start to end making everything seamless."
Hidden gem,Nice egg place. Bartender was super friendly. Pls order the lychee tea. Excellent balance of lychee and tea shaken not stirred .
Excellent service wonderful foods,"Chicken and watermelon, slow cook pork rib highly recommended. Mac and cheese is delicious too , using really good cheese."
Great food and service always.,Needed a last minute table and the service was so helpful and caring to my child and family. We promised to eat quickly (That was what we wanted anyway) and the service was helpful to find us a table. Food was good. Cocktails great. Lovely experience.
Yardbird,It was children's day and I brought my 9 yrs old nephew to the Art Science museum. We went to Yardbird for lunch as my nephew likes fried chicken. The kind and friendly staff advised that the set may be too large for us so l ordered items separately.The chicken and Mac and cheese were very nice and my nephew enjoyed the lunch. I also ordered the spice and herb watermelon which i love.
The Best Cocktail in Town,"It's my second time visiting this restaurant, Upper floor ambiance is better Overall is a good experience, and the cocktails drink is great!"
Family Dinner,"Wonderful food and service. Took the kids (big kids) here for dinner. The portions (esp Mac n Cheese) was very big, 4 person ordered 3 type of foods"
BEST CRAB CAKE BENEDICT,"The food was reaaaallyy good & staff was nice to prevent us from over-ordering. Our free-flow mimosas were sent to us at perfect timing (although we did have to start prompting them with 45 mins left). Other than that, the only one thing would be that we asked the door staff who sat us about their brunch mimosa offer, and she said she‚Äôd get back but didn‚Äôt and we just had to ask another staff about it."
Satisfying dinner,Friendly family restaurant. Loved their wide choices of sandwiches. Loved their smoked ribs and the mango salad. Very attentive and friendly team of staff led by Chef Josh.
Wonderful lunch at Yardbird,Food is delicious! Ambience is great! Service is great! We are impressed with the dining experience. We will return again to Yardbird!
Breakfast menu,It‚Äôs was well worth for the morning menu which I get which included a burger and drinks and coffee. Ordered a salad too
1st visit,Food is value for money Cocktail (smoke bomb) is well done Recommended food: - Chicken with watermelon - Mac & cheese - Smoked pork ribs - Popcorn shrimp
Sunday Brunch,The food is good but needs a kids' menu as well. We love the pancake confetti! And the chickens also tasty
Excellent Service,"My experience while dining at Yardbird was excellent. The food, wine and ambiance is perfect for us. The staff delivers good service as always but Joyce personalized service is unparalleled. Keep it up and continue to make your guests feel welcome and home."
Amazing smoked pork ribs!,Must try their smoked pork ribs! The fried chicken with waffles was good too. We also had their cake with bacon but it is a weird combination.
My favorite place,"I enjoy the food, the service, and ambience! Chicken in basket, burgers, salads, appetisers, wines, and desserts."
Lunch,Great place for lunch as we did not make a reservation but was given a table quickly. The staff at the reservation table was courteous and service was prompt with good recommendations for our lunch...
Great place to chill after work if you are staying in MBS,"Must try the chicken wings with waffles. it comes with watermelon which is a good way to compliment the meal. Also, they added vegetarian menu which is a good touch. Lastly, you must try their beer."
Lunch,"Good food, maybe too much for one person but flavor was enjoyable. Quite ex but worth the try for special occasions"
Very good experience though not quite,"First time to eat here with my 85 year old dad and 79 year old mom, both celebrating their respective birthday. Our dine-in experience is good, in fact it was very good. Service is quick, food is delicious and the service staff is very friendly , attentive and very accomodating, especially Rajes! The only thing that is not good is that they called me 3x confirming my reservation and while we are already inside and already eating, another call asking me if I am coming?!! Then I recalled that the staff at the entrance clicked the wrong name despite the fact I pointed my name to him, he just proceeded to give the menu to another lady and lead us to the table. Other than that all is well and we might come back and dine again."
America,"Classic American meals like burgers, Mac and cheese, and also interesting twist of fried chicken. But not cheap. Though has a reasonably priced set (but does not include choice of their signature dishes which is understandable).

But signature dishes quite pricey.

Daughter had crab cakes which were done well.
Wife had some protein salad which she was pleased with.
i enjoyed the burger which was excellent.

Total just over $100"
Friends meeting for lunch,"Food is great, 3 Main Course Portion Servings can be shared by 4 to 5 persons. this allows us to sample few main dishes. fried chicken and short ribs must order."
Great food and friendly service. Especially loved the brunch menu on weekends!,This was my 4th visit to Yardbird but I would keep coming back as I love the menu offerings. Everything tasted good.
Great Food and Service!,Very pleasant experience at the restaurant. The fried chicken and beef short ribs were fantastic. Service staff were friendly. Will definitely visit again!
Wonderful birthday dinner,Wonderful experience with great service. Very thankful to the staff of yardbird for making my birthday dinner memorable
Great Fried Chicken!,Ordered chicken & waffles & watermelon which seems to be signature dish in here. I could see everyone else in the restaurant ordering the same! Fried chicken were fantastic but not a fan of this type of soft waffles. Watermelon just nice to wash down the fried chicken
First time visit to Yardbird,"Food is not so bad. We ordered the chicken & waffles & watermelons and the smoked pork ribs. The former was okay; the waffles need improvement though. Glad that they acceded to our request for thigh and leg parts. The smoked pork ribs was better. I liked the smokiness flavour and the meat is very succulent!

Staff were all so friendly especially the Filipino servers!!!"
EXCELLENT,The meal was fresh and delicious The atmosphere was nice and the staff is ver friendly. Overall is a good experience to have dinner there.
Wonderful lunch at Yardbird,"Ate lunch with my family. Food was yummy, service was great (Russell in particular was friendly & helpful). Set lunch was good value - sizable servings. Ambience was nice - got a nice table by the window (facing inside MBS)."
Yummy Fried Chicken!,"One of our fave restaurant to go to. Service is good though this round , we had to try getting the staff attention a few times. Lovely brunch menu and the chicken with waffles is always our must order dish whenever we popped by!"
Visit of month,A nice place and food provided. The food also serve in fast. The only unsatisfied is the table a bit shaky. Otherwise all good!
A Return Visit,My first visit was pre-Covid and I've been wanting to return; Good thing a friend was in town so I used that as an excuse to get to YardBird for lunch. The experience was as good as I remembered it to be. Staff were friendly and knowledgeable with regard to their menu. An excellent place for a casual lunch/dinner with family and friends!
Great place to dine,Good initiative to close the glassdoors on a HOT Sunday afternoon. We dine in the aircon looking out into a Beautiful Marina.
Awesome first experience,Had a great experience with my friends here. Staff were friendly and food came promptly. Will definitely come again!
Wedding Anniversary,"Friendly staff, good service, yummylicious food and huge portion. Making our anniversary a memorable one. Will definitely recommend to friends and visit again. Thank you to the team"
Anniversary,"The staff are friendly, food was satisfied, will definitely come back again. The restaurant are more toward casual fine dining."
Love the BBQ ribs,"Ordering the Chicken & watermelon & waffles is almost must. FOMO when u see every table has one. If you are coming as a couple, beside the aforementioned, another main or side dish should fill you just nice. We had the Smoke BBQ ribs, the softest ribs we had ever. Thumbs up to the restaurant"
Great Team lunch,"We ordered executive lunch sets and food was wonderful, we loved every single dish, from the starter to the sides. Portion was generous and food was served timely and at the same time, so there's no waiting for all to have food on table before chomp-ing. This is very thoughtful touch, especially for a big group of 10."
Lunch Set,It was great experience to dine in at YardBird. Lunch set was super worthy for its price and quality. Best burger and buttermilk biscuit I tried so far!
Lunch at Yardbird,More lunch set variety will be good. Have a request for separate hot beverage menu. Restaurant ooens only at 12pm
One of our go-to restaurants in Marina Bay Sands,"Ambiance is good, staff is courteous and friendly. We ordered the chicken and waffles, and it was superb. Their salads and starters are also spot-on."
Good food!,Best brussel sprouts in Singapore! Staff is always friendly! Never fail on the quality of food. Will always recommand to come and give it a try.
Highly recommended,Food was good and worth the price. The service staff made it an even more pleasant experience. The interior and decor was very beautiful as well. Amazing!
Naize,"Worth the wait when I reserved the table more than a week before. Nicely done southern chicken with watermelon üçâ. Mac & cheese was thick & sticky üòã. Don't get the salad though, not much except leaves."
"Great food, ambience and friendly staff","Our first time to Yardbird and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Food was delicious and value for the money. The staff who attended to us were friendly and attentive, ensuring that all our requests were met. We had an enjoyable meal and would want to try the dinner menu next time!"
YUMMMM... EAT HERE!,"My friend and I had a full day of sightseeing and were late finding a place to dine. After over an hour of popping from one place to another, we stumbled on Yardbird in Marina Bay Sands Mall. Not sure what to expect, we were starving and the manager took mercy on us and agreed to let us put in an order just after the kitchen had closed. Not only was he (and the staff) very kind about it, the food was AMAZING! I'm from the south in the United States and it was some of the best fried chicken I have ever had. And the salad with mango was incredible. So appreciative and our tummies were very happy!"
Wonderful night,"Warmest greeting ever by the staff at yardbird,
Had our anniversary celebration at yardbird.
Food was marvellous, delicous and the service was at the top of the topnotch.

Nevertheless..the take away from this restaurant was the bartender - habail
Cocktail was well blend , with beautiful presentation.
