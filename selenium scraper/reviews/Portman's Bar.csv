Conveniently located,We went twice to this bar on 4th floor - first day we had a nice bruschetta appie and glass of wine and beer. High cost for drinks but easy access. Second visit we ordered a clubhouse sandwich and fries to share - plenty for two and a delish easy lunch.
Completely overpriced,"I was charged $22 for two coffees here, and the cups were only half full, and it was terrible coffee. The staff don't much care for good service either"
Comfortable place to have your high tea,Service is good and high tea has a wide selection of food. It has more savory than sweet selection which is ideal for me. The sandwich is abit dry but still acceptable. Very comfortable place to just relax and have high tea on a weekday afternoon. Not crowded. Price is reasonable too.
Avoid for high tea if you are particular abt service,"Had the festive high tea at portsman bar. In terms of service, it is really bad compared to other hotel high tea.

1) Made the reservation via their website for festive high tea (selected the high tea option) but was told on the spot that they it was not indicated in their record that we are having high tea. Although they did try to serve the set subsequently but not the best experience to be told that high tea might not be available when a group of us took time off work specially for high tea.

2) no high tea menu or tea/coffee menu given, so we had to google the menu on our own.

3) waited 40 mins for the food and drinks to be served.

4) staff did not bother to explain the items served. I've been to at least 20 hotel high tea ans this is the first time that staff didnt bother explaining.

5) saw that our food items (some xmas bauble sweet item) were missing some deco compared to other table.  Inconsistent.

6) too many young waiters who could not answer our questions when enquiring simple questions. When they got a more senior staff over, we had to repeat our questions all over again

I think it's really the worse hotel high tea in terms of service for a long while. Definitely not what i was expecting from a 5 star hotel with such a good rating on tripadvisor. Avoid if you are planning to go there for high tea unless you dont mind the service.

Nevertheless, the food quality is good. The ambience is also good. Thanks to the staff for allowing us to enjoy the high tea until way past our high tea slot time. But the mgt definitely need to do something abt upskilling the staff in terms of service."
Lovely hotel but lacking of staff,Arrived at the hotel around 10ish. Me and my partner ordered drinks and food. The boy who assisted us didn't inform us about our food orders. Waited for an hour just to find out it was not ordered in the system. Luckily Jane helped us and made her way to assist us through out our dining. Thanks so much again Jane!
"A comfortable, quiet, relaxing hotel bar.",We had drinks in Portman's on several days during our recent stay. We always found the bar comfortable and the staff helpful and friendly.
Billing issuresponded responded,"Had afternoon tea sets in late July. Mistakenly redeemed Chope vouchers and paid the bar the same day...Immediately sought assistance from Chope, after two weeks, Chope said the restaurant still had not updated them."
"Wonderfullllll staff, food and hotel","Great great great! The staffs were super awesome! Jane took care of us and assisted us with our drinks and food. Everyone was awesome but Jane took care of us like we were kings! Lol. Service, drinks, ambiance and the hotel itself! We will definitely come back for more and will inform our friends. Thank you so much for taking good care of us and providing excellent service"
Goooooooood,"I was good experience with portmans bar serve by mika, katie, honey with heidi, it‚Äô was good experience in singapore i will not forget it and mozie‚Äôs singapore was perfect‚ù§Ô∏è I will visit again"
Delicious and worth it.,Afternoon tea is very delicious and worth the money. Staffs are very friendly and good service. Hope to visit again next time.
"A place made to relax, catch up, enjoy!","Thankful that we found the right place to celebrate my birthday!

Enjoy the ambience, treats and services!

Talking about service, we were pleasantly amused and served by Mr Monzie, who cheered us up with his sweet talk and attention to our needs. He even lent his HP wire to me because my HP power is getting low.

Ms Anastasia was also very helpful and made sure that we were all comfortably seated and served.

All in all, a wonderful place to visit. Highly recommended!"
"Awesome service, great hotel",Me and my family stayed in the hotel for few days and I can say thay the hotel is really great except for the room service that got my order incorrectly. Jane helped me with my orders even though we were dining at Peppermint. She even made her way to help me the incorrect food and informed the FO to help me out. We will definitely come back.
Nice staff,"Isabelle and honey is very nice..‚ù§Ô∏è
Honey smiled and welcomed me so beautifully when she came in, and Isabel kept checking if I needed anything and treated me kindly. The hotel lounge is so pretty and the atmosphere and the song are all great I'll be back more often to eat delicious food Thanks to the kindness of the staff, I had a great day today. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Beautifully venue for a family outing. But‚Ä¶,"The skyline bar and pool is an amazing space for families. We visit almost every weekend and happily spend hours (and dollars) to enjoy the space. Johari makes the experience so much more special. He makes the best cocktails and is constantly watching out for as many guests as he can.

But the hotel‚Äôs management should come visit (and stay a few hours) every week to see the real problem.

There should at least be 3 service staff on weekends, not one. I see staff from the gym coming over to help, but then the gym is left unmanaged.

It‚Äôs a beautiful venue enjoyed by guests. Don‚Äôt let the service be rated negatively because HR thinks one staff is sufficient for weekends.

It is not."
Mr.W,"It has been a pleasant stay in the hotel for last few days, and few of us like the bar a lot at 4/F.
The bar service team are super friendly and the drinks that prepared were nicely served that it kept us chasing for more rounds last few nights.
Few of us reordered ‚ÄòMoscow mule‚Äô a lot as we found it‚Äôs very refreshing with great taste. I‚Äôm impressed by the great services that provided by the bar representative team: Michelle , Honelyn , Mozie , Heidi & Isabelle.
This bar will surely be a great memory for us all, and I‚Äôll come here again for sure whenever I revisit SG."
So goood bar,"So good bar. Especially, Honey, Heidi, and Isabelle served foods. They were so kind. It was the most beautiful and nice bar I've ever been to. I won't forget it. When I come here, I feel relax thanks to the kind staffs. I strongly recommend it!"
Cocktail Drinks at Portman Bar,"It was relaxing experience at the Portmans Bar, the drinks was lovely and the service from Honey and Morizie is attentive, friendly. The drinks was tasty, will come back again! Keep it up üòä"
Thank you for your service and drinks~,"Thank for their kind service and drinks Especially Honey, Monzie, Kris, Isabelle and Heidi I enjoyed 2 cocktails and tea. It was amazing I think this bar is the best in SG I will be in there soon:)"

Peppermint & portmans bar,"Staff here were very friendly and provided with excellent service. Roy from peppermint was very polite and friendly. Ordered the ribeye steak and it tasted great! Afterwards had a drink at portman bar where Honey, Mika and monzie provided excellent bar service. All of them were really joyful and even had a short friendly chat with them. Overall a really pleasant experience and would definitely come back again!"
High Tea at Portman's Bar,"Had a peaceful Afternoon tea to catch up with friends yesterday. The ambience is good. The afternoon tea is presented in a nice rattan picnic bag. I must give the pastry chef a thumbs up for the sweets presented. The creativity of the sweets is impressive and delectable.
Kudos to Bryan Tok, who assist in my reservation request despite on his off day.

The service provided by Katie is excellent. Her smile brightens the whole atmosphere, and she handles request politely. Another person to mention is Raj, he is very approachable. He is knowledgeable on the items served when asked and when our session in the Pavilion ends at 5pm as there was another reservation, Raj without any hesitant agree to us to seat at the bar area to continue our chat.

Service is impeccable, and the associates mentioned in here are truly gems to the hotel!"
Honey was a delight,"Was at Portman‚Äôs Bar on 8/3/22 with some business associates. Honey was attentive and friendly, providing the best service. The drinks were delicious and the environment was very conducive for business talks.

Staff were short, as with every establishment today. But all trying very hard and apologetic for the long wait. Everyone worked very hard and stretched but still very patient. Service recovery after was 100%
Grateful for the F&B staff and their persistence . Thank you PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay."

Affordable and delicious high tea with a view,"This is my return visit for this high tea. We enjoyed the good mix of savoury and sweets served in a pretty vintage case. While the tea range is limited, the tea was premium from TWG. In addition, the ladies who picked up my phonecall prior to visit were very kind to accomodate to my request for a mini cake to congratulate my friend on her wedding. Raj was also very friendly and helped us with our photos against the beautiful interior. It was a pleasant experience overall, thanks to the staff, food and ambience. Recommended to visit (:"
An Outstanding and Fun place to chill!!!,"To start it off, i would like to commend the staffs working there for their excellent work ethic as i have been there many times before and would like to say that at that place not only are the staffs there welcoming and friendly, they are also caring and would greet customers and treat them like close friends rather than just mere customers. I can vividly remember Mika, Jacqueline,Vita and honey providing fantastic service to me and my friends and of course the 2 lovely bartenders Michael and Julie to keep conversations going and making delectable and tasty drinks the whole night!!!
Absolute pleasure to go there and would always leave with a bright smile,11/10 will recommend this place to anyone who needs a mood lift or just a fancy place to hang out with friends.( Plus all the staffs and bartenders here are ÎÑàÎ¨¥ÏòàÎΩÄ )"

Always a good time,"I‚Äôm slowly becoming a regular here because the drinks & service are always TOP NOTCH.

My friends and I wanted non-alcoholic drinks because we had work the next day, and even the non-alcoholic drinks were DELICIOUS.

Despite the bar being very busy, Michael and Jaqueline gave us a warm welcome - they are really the stars of the show. A nice lady called Julie (?) was also very friendly.

My friends and I had a great time!"

Amazing service and cocktails by Mixologist Michael,"Fantastic experience! The cocktails mixed by mixologist Michael were brilliant, absolutely delightful, delicious, and the herbs came from the garden in the hotel. Food was scrumptious as well! The chilli crab cakes were to die for. Service was ace, and the ambience was amazing. In the day, you‚Äôll get to enjoy the birdsong from birds in the atrium while drinking delightful cocktails. Quite a good selection of whiskies at the bar as well. Highly recommend this bar for cocktails and meals. Kimchi?! is an delicious cocktail with kimchi juice, it‚Äôs absolutely lovely. Thank you Michael for your hospitality~! You made our stay in Park Royal Marina. :)"
The best service ever (consistently),"I've come to Portman Bar many time for lunch. Their barrimandi dish is by far the best I've ever had. If you do come, do order this.
For desserts I absolutely enjoy the coconut gula melaka. Its special and tasty.
I also enjoy the consistently fantastic service by the staff: Honeyly, Selfa and Jacquelyn. They have always given the best service to every diner. Thank you ladies.
Its always a joy dining here. And we'll definitely return."

SQ-standard service and beautiful high tea!,"Ambience: 10/10
Service: 11/10
Food: 8/10
Price: 8/10

Wow! The revamped area is a mirror image of the Pan Pacific Hotel or even better! The sofa were huge and luxurious, the ambience lighting were warm and the classical BGM just sets the mood right.

My wife and I was served by Vita and Selfa. We were absolutely impressed by the SQ-standard of service displayed by both of them. Volunteered to take photos for us, asked if the tea/coffee were great and want to make a change, asked if the food was great, explained through the different types of food that were on the plating. Kudos to both of them!

We ordered the high tea set ($48++ per pax). Had free flow TWG tea (Peppermint and Earl Grey). The food platter served in a picnic box was stunning, the savoury did well on tickling our taste buds, however the dessert were a tad too sweet for us, especially the chocolate ones. Price wise i would say its on the cheaper side as it is based on a good star hotel.

Overall our experience here is wonderful. I would be back again to try their ala carte menu and hopefully their service is still as professional! Once again good job for the wonderful service crew!"
Hi Tea @ Portman Bar,Nice ambience and great service from Selfa and Mika ! Picnic hi tea set served in a wonderful setting which I totally enjoyed ! üòä
High tea at Portsman Bar,"It was our first time for high tea at Portsman bar and it was an enjoyable experience. Both service staff Vita and Selfa were pleasant, friendly and prompt to assist us. The high tea set had a good mix of savoury and sweets. We like how the chef took notice of our dietary restrictions and replaced some items to suit our taste. The surrounding environment was very nice and relaxing. The high tea experience was value for money and we would definitely visit again."
Very Good,Portman‚Äôs has one of the most excellent customer service. The staff Selfa asking me how my day was..that was sweet. Had lobster laksa which was so good! üòçDefinitely will go back.
Amazing hospitality,"Good vegetarian/vegan options. Please call them and make reservation ahead so they can prepare vegetarian/vegan high tea.

Vita the waiter provided excellent hospitality! She showed us around the bar and also let us know what are the vegan/vegetarian option that we can eat.

While I was rushing back to room, I accidentally left my earphone behind, Vita went beyond her responsible and call to my room to let me know. Thank you so much.

I will definitely go back again!"
Evening drink,"Chilled out place to enjoy a drink or two in the evening. Lots of greenery with very comfy seating, which is spread out. High feeling as it‚Äôs in the atrium gives it a airy outdoors kinda setting. Very attentive and courteous service. Nice place for couples to relax."
