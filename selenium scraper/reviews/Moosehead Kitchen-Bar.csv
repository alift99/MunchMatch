Great service and music,Service staff were all males. Very professional. Good was amazing though portions slight small for the price. Reservations recommended.
Lunch,"Good place with atmosphere. Quite expensive, portions small and on my last visit service was very poor."
Dishonest Restaurant,"We ordered Octopus with paprika from the main menu. I would expect a much bigger serving as it's a main dish, but the portion you got don't even fit as a side. I told the waiter that the portion is small and expensive that its priced at $35, his response is that its ""A tentacle and is from Spain"". I was appalled because what I got is one skinny tentacle measuring not more than 1.5cm in diameter at its fattest top and 16cm in length, copped up in tiny pieces mixed with same tiny potatoes to camouflage in a dimly lighted place but we took a clear pic. I had Octopus in Spain as a main before and they serve the whole Octopus with vegetables and that is a lot of tentacles. I also had a meal with one single thick tentacle that you can cut into served with prawns and potatoes. In comparison, here is one miserable skinny tentacle chopped up in 10 pieces that I can finished in 2 mouthfuls and they even dared charged a whopping $35++. Don't dine or drink there because you will surely experience some form of dishonest and unethical practices in this restaurant."
Tasty but small portion,Quaint little restaurant at a convenient location. Went for lunch. Quality was good but portion is small. Main course seems more like appetizers. Maybe that‚Äôs why most people I saw ordered burgers instead. Had to go to the hawker centre next door to fill our stomachs
Cosy place,Small place and ventilation is a bit weak so you can smell the kitchen from my seat inside. Staff didn't take note of my reservation request of a birthday celebration so I had to ask for a candle in front of my fiancee. The roasted barramundi and pumpkin ravioli tasted great so that was the highlight of the meal.
Always excellent,"I have been a fan of Moosehead for many years. From the excellent wine and service to the absolutely delicious and well-priced food, we have enjoyed many great nights in this cosy restaurant. Since COVID restrictions were first imposed last year, Moosehead‚Äôs delivery service has been one of the most impressive. Clear and excellent communication over WhatsApp, easy payment, and deliveries always on time. They also came out with a special porchetta dish which became a solid family favourite during lockdown. Please keep supporting this wonderful restaurant through hard times. I have absolutely no affiliation, just genuinely want this gem of a place to survive and thrive!"
"Excellent food, friendly staff","LOVE the Pork Jowl and Striploin, super tender and juicy! Definitely must try!
It was our first time using the Entertainer App and we encountered a minor hiccup. But the staff (looked like the manager, forgot to ask for his name) settled it very professionally even though the fault was mainly ours. Good service! Nice environment, recommend to visit!"
Good lunch (within Covid period),"Nice food and service. Ordered barramundi and burger, and desserts, too. Please was full, but spaced far enough apart for Covid measure."
"Impressive food, will be back","Was recommended this place, and it didn't fail. Through the reviews and recommendation, we tried the ravioli and burger. Ordered the roasted cauliflower as well. Basically everything on the menu looks worth a try. The roasted cauliflower is really quite exceptional and the burger is succulent. The ravioli has a really interesting taste which springs some familiarity yet quite unable to pinpoint what is it. Didn't get to try the dates though it seems really good. Need to be back for more."
Great Birthday Night,"Excellent Food & Excellent Service from both the Waitress and Waiter. We loved the Barramundi, Lamb Kofta & Striploin. Enuff Said."
Cozy place with great service and flavour,Love the Mediterranean flavours in the food. Cozy vibes for casual evenings. Waiter who served us was diligent at making sure we enjoy ourselves and also helped in making sure we don‚Äôt over or under order. Highly recommended: grilled eggplant with tomato to go with pita bread
"Great burgers, good vibes during lunch","I recommend the Moosehead burger. The balance of flavours were great and the burger was juicy (medium), and importantly the bun was good too.
Comes with a side of skinny chips.

The service staff are friendly, attentive and efficient, even during the lunch peak.

Overall great experience, I will definitely be back for the burgers again."
Very good service with good food,The restaurant was kind enough to call me to tell me what time their kitchen will close because I was arriving quite late for lunch. The attitude of the waiting staff were very positive making the experience superb. Food was also good and am interested to come another time to try other stuff in the menu =)
Great food for sharing,"We ordered 3 sharing bites (Grilled Cauliflower, Feta starter, bacon wrapped date) and a sandwich each (Pulled pork, fried chicken) for 2 big eaters - loved all the dishes. Sharing is highly reccommended"
Good food and great service!,Nice small Bistro that serve good food. Had Pork Ragu and was very nice. Excellent service despite the busy lunch crowd. Will return!
Tasty lunch at Moosehead,I was here last month for lunch with a colleague. Surprisingly busy at lunchtime on a weekday despite the city location and the ongoing pandemic situation. Luckily we had a reservation otherwise there would have been no chance to get a seat. Good food and efficient service.
Birthday celebration,"Moosehead Kitchen & Bar is a cozy bistro located at Telok Ayer. It serves tantalizing and satisfying dishes that tickles my palate. Here are the items I had tried during one dinner seating with my friends. Ordered according to my preference and category.

Main Course + Sides
1) Pork Jowl is juicy, soft, and mouth-watering.
2) Grilled Squid is surprisingly soft and fresh. It does not have the rubbery texture like most places does... so this is a thumbs up for me
3) Hummus paired with Pita Bread is a good in-between snack to break away from the heavy flavoured main items.
4) Butternut Pumpkin Ravioli is savory and the texture is just right.
5) I remember the Crab Cake to be moist, soft and a bouncy feel.
6) The BBQ Pork Rib is a little too sweet for my tastebud.
7) Roast Cauliflower could be a little bit softer to have it melt in the mouth. This feels like I am eating it slightly raw.
8) Australian striploin marinated peppers and herb butter is a little lack-lustre. Won't recommend this...
.
Desserts:
1) Pistachio Cake is lovely with the nutty flavour
2) The Lava cake is not the best I had but it's definitely at the defacto standard."
Good food at decent value and excellent service,"My husband & I ate at Moosehead 3 days ago and enjoyed ourselves tremendously. The food is good - we had a dip, bacon dates, cauliflower (superb), broccoli, bbq ribs, pork ragu pasta, 2 desserts & 2 drinks. Must compliment the 2 wait staff. Thank you ladies for your recommendations & patience. You were great!!"
The best tzatziki in town!,"The best tzatziki in town! I love their tzatziki, and the broccolini was delicious too... oh and the pistachio dessert was delicious ü§§ the service was quick and friendly. Cozy place but I just think the food menu should have more options.."
Excellent food and drink!,"Moosehead does everything right. Definitely go here for fresh, flavorful food and darn good drinks served by friendly staff in an unpretentious atmosphere. A recent meal here included chicken tacos and crunchy feta. Their authentic charcoal grill adds a rich smokey flavor to starters roasted cauliflower and bacon-wrapped figs. Their cocktails are phenomenal too. Located in the quaint Telok Ayer neighborhood of Singapore, do make reservations or visit during off-peak hours because Moosehead gets busy,"
Nice relaxed vibe and friendly staff,Had a lovely dining experience at Moosehead bar. It has a nice relaxed vibe and the staff were friendly and very helpful. We‚Äôll definitely be back again.
Good Place,"Nice Location, food was different but tasty and pricy. We were given less time because of social distancing."
One word! - Yumm!!!!! Love this little place,Little place but great flavours.Loved the dates wrapped in bacon- to die for! And broccoli With nice side sauce was tasty. Wine selection is great as well. So both thumbs up for Moosehead
Absolutely Delicious,Family dinner with the kids. Everything was so well prepared and the staff so friendly that the kids were totally happy with the whole experience. The broccolini and cauliflower disappeared with only happy noises and the other 'safer options' were mindblowingly yummy!!!
Excellent food and service,"My partner and I visited Moosehead on Friday, 20 March for light dinner. we had a couple of drinks from the Happy Hour menu (Aperol spritzer and a Negroni) with Roast Cauliflower, flat bread and lamb kofta. They were all delicious."
Good experience,Have visited a few times for beers after work with friends. It‚Äôs been a good experience each time. The Roast Chicken here is also really good. Its located at a convenient location in CBD right next to Telok Ayer MRT station. The pricing is moderate considering the location. Recommended !
Fantastic little city lunch spot,Fantastic little bistro in the city. Simple but beautifully cooked fare. The set lunch is a great bargain. While the place is always bustling the staff are friendly and helpful. This is fast becoming a regular hang out.
Decent,"Food was decent, shall try other dishes on menu the next time. Pretty regret not to try G&T since there‚Äôs grapefruit in it"
One of the Best Diner on Telok Ayer,"Just to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù for our meal on Monday. We all enjoyed your delicious food, wine recommendation and the evening was everything we hoped it would be. Thank you so much."
We were so excited to eat,We were so excited to eat Mediterranean food but it was nothing Mediterranean about it. The tzatziki was basically a cucumber mix loaded with dill - tasted nothing like what you would eat in Greece. Everything and I mean everything (even the side of raw carrots) was drenched in olive oil and salt. Just slathered in olive oil. I felt greasy just walking out of there! Prices were reasonable for the food. The tuna tartare was delicious if you could get past the olive oil.
Best Burger!,"Moosehead never fails to disappoint and whenever I've a craving for burger, this is the go-to place. This is by no means a ""burger"" place as there is only one choice from the menu. We discovered it during our first visit where we ordered a bunch of stuff from the menu (including the burger) and we were blown away by it. I've gone back many times just for the burger. The brioche bun is soft and fluffy, meat patty is grilled with the right amount of char and juicy with every bite. Other note-worthy dishes include the fried artichoke, cauliflower, broccolini and tuna tartare."
Great food!,Love the food there. Not your usual western dishes but with fusion influences. Very healthy too! It‚Äôs a place that i will go back to. Reservation needed.
Always Delicious Food,Moosehead is our go to for a casual night with friends. Food never disappoints. A few essentials that are always on the menu that you have to have. Also so yummy new dishes. Love this place
loved it,"The food seemed a bit on the fusion side. For appetizer we had warm pita with hummus and marinated olives (yum), then we had fried pig ears (very nice), for mains we had Hamachi fish with apple relish and salmon roe (so impressed) as well as avocado topped with crab flakes and some spicy lime dressing (not spicy actually). The dessert was also really nice (pistachio cake with lemon cream and chocolate mousse with biscuit crumbs though the mousse was more like smooth pudding)

This was for a birthday lunch and the casual atmosphere was very fitting."
Service friendly + food yum,"Not my first time here. Food is still super good. The grilled broccoli is to die for. The burrata is super yum too. The roasted cauliflower is delicious. Didn't particularly enjoy the house red though (wasn't to my taste). Perhaps more choice needed for the house wine.

Other than that, still brilliant as usual. Thank you!

(Oh and the ang mo staff looks like a famous tv actor but I can't remember the actors name for the life of me). Haha"
Disappointing,"We ordered 5 different dishes, and they were all hit or miss. Some were nice, but others were not tasty.

Service was annoying - they kept taking away the dishes before we were done with them - there was still sauce on the plate which we wanted. I would prefer that staff ask before they take away a plate, rather than assume that it's ok and just grab it.

And lastly, their website is useless!"
1 for 1 main,"Foods are pretty good, but services can be better. Ambiance is so so, a little too dark and narrow..."
Casual lunch date,"Booked this place for lunch as there was a 1 for 1 promotion. Their cheeseburger was surprisingly good. However, their Reuben sandwich was a bit too salty for my liking. Salad was a bit pricey."
One of the best chill out place near MRT,"Food on the menu are all very unique. Portion of the food can be more, a bit on the pricy side also. Friendly hosts, good ambience for gathering and drink. Limited selection of üç∫."
Consistent & delicious grub,"Don't expect anything fancy and you'll walk out a happy camper. The atmosphere is casual. We've been twice over lunch & have had decent meals from their slightly limited menu. Don't get me wrong. There's something for everyone. It's just a tight menu and probably a blessing since most of the sandwiches & mains are great tasting and portions are decent.

Only fault I have is with the sides. They're bare bones but I suppose at the price, one ought-not to be catty.

I personally think they do a great cheeseburger but wish they'd just throw in some fries on the house."
Cozy European feel,"The space us quite small but very nice, kind of brought us back to Europe. We ordered fried feta cheese, mushroom and roasted chicken."
Little gem off the beaten track!,"Stumbled across this little gem when looking for something a little different in Singapore. This is not in the main tourist areas, but is opposite one of the underground stations so easy to get to, not far from China town.

We chose this place because of good TA reviews but also the menu. This has a middle eastern slant, hence why we went as it was different. This is a very small place but had a great atmosphere with all tables taken and local business workers enjoying after work drinks. We chose the mese followed by lamb kofte, both dishes were excellent, very tasty and very reasonably priced. Also had a nice reasonably priced wine list.

Service was excellent also. Only criticism was the food was served very quickly, so the dinner could be over in less than an hour unless we had asked them to slow down. However we found this in other places in Singapore also.

Would recommend this place and would return if we are back in Singapore."
Don‚Äôt miss,"Nice restaurant in Telok Ayer. Lot of nice restaurants around, but Moosehead is really special. Do not miss the roasted cauliflower"
"High hopes, but not very impressed","Service was okay, but the food was average. Dishes were too oily. Sauces had no flavor. Vegetables were burnt to a black char and tasted like ash. There's a fine line between smokiness and cancer inducing char that is not edible. Overall, not really impressed and would not recommend this place. Also, very overpriced for what you get."
Great food but horrible ambiance,"First time there. Had heard good things about food, which was very good. The chef is a treasure. However, space is cramped. it was a hot, humid Singapore evening and the airconditioning was not working. They said it was mechanical defects. Hard to believe all 4 air-cons had mechanical issues. We had to wait 45 mins to get a table and they gave us one next to the delivery passage. Overall setting is cramped and ambiance horrible for such great food. I will not be going back unless they change venue and improve service as in the wait time."
Crunchy Feta Balls,"I came to Moosehead on my last trip to Singapore 2 years ago,
I was not sure if it would live up to memory, let me tell you; it exceeded my expectations!
This is mostly western food, but Singapore being a bit of a melting pot you can experience a range of quinines.

The food is delicious and very fairly priced!
We had:
*Cruncy Feta Balls (I have dreams about these)
*A platter of dips and flatbread, all dips were lovely and fresh, the flatbread was also great and when we ran out we were quickly given more.
*Lamb Kofta- very well cooked and well seasoned lamb- possibly the wrong kind of flat bread accompanying this dish though (the one used for the dips may go better)
*Pumpkin Ravioli- to die for! Possibly one of the best balanced dishes I‚Äôve ever eaten!

We have vegetarians in the family and it was great to see multiple options to cater for everyone.
Staff were friendly and accomodating but didn‚Äôt hover.
Tables can be a little crowded as it is a very small space but it did not take away from our experience."
"Have the pulled pork burger. It's a ""mummy-load""!","We should have just had that and the side of fries. Our intention was to try their reuben sandwich that looked just absolutely enticing from pictures. Well, let's just say that they could revisit the essentials of a good reuben. Thousand island dressing, if present, did not do anything to moisten up an otherwise dry assembly of a sandwich. The melted cheese was hard and cold, the pastrami on its own was surprisingly decent.

Now on to that pulled porker. Overflowing with tender, juicy, well seasoned pork. Unusually moist but it sure made slurping up every last bite a joy. This delicious burger is quite a feeder so small eaters might like to share. Fries were simply seasoned and very respectable. Crisp on the outside with a good potato creaminess that came forth from each bite.

Love the ambiance of this place. Unpretentious. As expected with most of these hipster cafes around these parts, service is a little flippant but polite."
"Great atmosphere, delicious food",Simply and easy going place. Nice terrace in a quiet street. Very kind servers and good food for fair prices. Try their organic sodas!
"Great food, a small popular restaurant","A great little place, it was very busy full of with expats Prices were not bad for Singapore Food was great Burnt butter Pumpkin Ravioli was the best, would put the Sticky date pudding as the least favourite"
Lovely Special,The food is excellent as I had their specials which is Seabream on Papilloute with white wine sauce. I also had Pumpkin Ravioli which is also a must try!! Go during Saturday night for a calm dinner.
2nd visit to Moosehead,Ordered 2 small plate (Bacon wrap olive and Grilled cauliflowers) and 2 main; Pork Jowl and Grilled Octopus. The sauce in Grilled Cauliflowers is very unique and taste fantastic. The rest of the dishes are up to expectation as well but portion is a bit small for the main.
Dont come here for lunch,"after reading so much about moosehead, i was really looking forward to coming here for the first time. after all it has been around for a while in an area known for its high turnover of eating and drinking places. how bad could it possibly get? the bad news: it is that bad.

For starters, i don't consider myself a v discerning eater. And i'm willing to pay because I can afford it. I knew Moosehead wasn't going to be cheap, but I did expect some quality to go with that price.

I dined there with 1 companion. She had a mackerel and I had a cheese burger. She didn't comment much about her mackerel. As for my burger, the patty was small (perhaps like 4"" in diameter).

Waiter did tell me beforehand that the burger would have no sides, so I was prepared for that. But I didn't expect to still feel hungry after that. Granted, I skipped the bun as it was, well, just simply bread. There was nothing special about it. It was probably the same gardenia type of bread you find at the supermarket. Same for the patty. You could get a more decent burger at amoy street food centre just down the road for half the price - similar sized patty, and it comes WITH a charcoal bun AND nachos (granted the food centre has no air con, but there's hardly any at Moosehead either).

With lots of space left in our tummies, we decided to have dessert. We shared a creme caramel and a pistachio cake. both priced at $11 each. The caramel was only about 3.5-4"" across. the slice of cake was similarly small. There was a nice sweetish-sourish icing on it but overall, $11 each was not worth the price. if you want desert and don't mind splurging, do yourself a favour and head to pantler just down the street. they're pricey but at least the cakes are worth every penny. and the ambience is way better.

total bill came up to $71.80 for 2 pax. considering what we ate, I would say it was totally not value for $.

Aside from food, ambience is lacking (stuffy and noisy - like a hawker centre - ie better off eating at a hawker centre for a fraction of the price) and service is so-so, not great but not poor either.

Moosehead might be better at dinner. just don't come here for lunch."
Great food and decent service,"Love this place. Above average pricing, but the quality makes up for it. My fave? The grilled Broccolini... it was nicely charred and deliciously balanced with its umami peanut sauce. Steaks were perfectly done, the salads fresh and crisp and delicious.

The outside seats are great though a little small (four people is pushing it cos of the silly vertical bars that connect to the ceiling cos it blocks your access to the table).

The pasta was good, wasn‚Äôt too impressed by the burger but it was superbly done to my doneness (med rare) and juicy so no complaints.

Been there three times already and will keep coming back!"
Our favourite!,This place is amazeballs! Great veg and meat options and an appropriate wine list. Melbourne meets Singapore üí™
Great burger and a cosy place!,Burger was awesome! Totally love the bun (exactly crispy on the outside and soft fluffly on the inside)! Service was perfect also! Ambience was great and location is exactly next to the mrt! Totally nothing to fault to restaurant on. 5 stars and definitely worth a repeat visit!
Great spot for dinner - simple as!,"I'll keep things short and sweet - if you need a place for dinner that serves great food, provides fantastic service and a lovely atmosphere, then make sure you head to Moosehead.Without a doubt one of my favourite dinner spots in Singapore and it never disappoints!"
Simple dinner in a really small bar,Seating was very cramp. Food was average and too salty for our liking. Limited options for main courses. Value for money though.
Good food but staff forgot about discount,"Food was very good but we had asked the staff about the 1-for-1 main deal and he said we could use it, but it was not applied in the final bill in the end. My fault for not checking but I would‚Äôve assumed he made a note when we made the order."
"Great food, great service","As always, moosehead never fails to please with its food. The pork jowl was fantastic, as was the roasted cauliflower. We loved every bit of it."
Very enjoyable,"It was our first time to visit. Selected the restaurant based on their menu. No regrets. We ordered meze board to share: feta cheese in honey dip were amazing!and everything else too! Then steaks, burger, lamb kofta for the mains. Everything was cooked to our utter delight. Some good wine Pinot Noir to go with it.
Creme caramel and pistachio cake for desserts were just as delicious.
The team was very pleasant and friendly. We were served quickly. Absolutely recommend!"
Cosy atmosphere with great sharing plates,"Had dinner there with a couple of friends and we ordered 4 mains to share among ourselves. Granted they were not substantial if you were ravenous or a guy but it was enough to fill 4 ladies quite nicely. We had the moosehead cheeseburger and topped up with a serving of fries since it came without, pork jowl, lamb kofta and the barramundi. Across all dishes we found 1 thing consistent, and that was that the chefs were a bit too generous with the salt but I guess the accompanying elements in the various dishes did help neutralize that slightly. The best dish of the night had to go to the lamb kofta which was well seasoned, not gamey and a brilliant pairing with the yoghurt to balance out the heaviness of the mediterranian spices. The cheeseburger was great as well especially since you could choose the doneness of the patty and the accompanying fries were certainly addictive. Pork jowl was executed well and the barramundi as well although the accompanying fennel salad could be better dressed.All in all a great meal with a cosy atmosphere although don't expect huge portions despite the price."
Back for another burger,"I came back here for another burger recently with a friend. Once again a good quality product, although priced at the higher end. But quite a good deal if you use the Entertainer app. Worth another visit."
a happy tummy is a happy person,food is really yummy but the portioning is really small. the atmosphere is not too bad. the staff are really friendly.
High quality food (slightly strange prices),"Visited Moosehead with my teammates for lunch (group of 4).

We ordered a number of sharing items including a platter of dips, 2 types of grilled vegetables and fries. Each person also had their own ‚Äúmain‚Äù including salads, burgers and pastas.

The food was of a high quality overall. Everyone hugely enjoyed eating. The grilled vegetables were a standout, with people saying they were the best damn vegetables they had ever had! The only small issue we had was the fries were overly salty.

One thing that befuddled us about Moosehead was the pricing of the food items on the menu. We felt that the prices of the appetisers were relatively high when compared to the prices of the mains. For example, a portion of grilled vegetables cost $16 while the pasta was $20."
"Great food, good atmosphere","We've been going to Moosehead for years and absolutely love both the food and cozy atmosphere. Highly recommend this nice, but busy, little restaurant nestled on the corner of Telok Ayer."
Great food - reasonably priced (expensive wine though),"We stumbled upon this place as it was getting late and there was not much open. We had a lovely dinner - the foot was excellent and reasonably priced.
We did order a glass of house red - not checking on the price - turned out to be $19 a glass - which I think was pretty steep - so check first before ordering any wine."
Always Delicious,Been coming to Moosehead for over 3 years. And it never disappoints. You need to make a booking as it‚Äôs very popular. Lots of really yummy veggie options. Food is always delicious
Disappointed,"Tried Moosehead based on the reviews, but it was an underwhelming experience. Couldn‚Äôt work out if service was unobstructive or just lazy but I had to wave the staff down for every order. I wasn‚Äôt overly impressed with the food. Artichokes were very nice but the gnocchi while nicely presented was tasteless and lacked flavour. Overall pretty average experience."
Incredible food and wonderful staff,"This place is a tiny hole in the wall that makes up for its size with its incredible menu and great staff.

Fun banter with the staff with fantastic recommendations for drinks.

A great menu for sharing with interesting combinations of flavours.

Good selection of wine but limited beers. Must try are the bacon wrapped dates!"
Cool restaurant with good food,"A pretty cool little restaurant that stands out with a Moosehead right at the entrance, so you won't miss it. Food was surprisingly good with pleasant ambience and service was not bad too. Food portions were a little small, but it's also good so you may order a little more to share to try out more of their food on the menu."
Overpriced for what you get,"The atmosphere in this bar is nice. However, the food and availability of it was a bit of a disappointment.
We asked the waiter for one of the cocktails on the menu - which they did not have. We then asked the waiter for one of the small plates - again they did not have. The food we ordered was not worth the price."
great food,"food was great, had good recommendations from staff! just note that its kinda small and noisy, otherwise food was delish!"
"Great vibe, small local spot","Great vibe and food. Portions are small so get a couple of things! Had the skirt steak which was amazing. Very welcoming and great service. Seems to be a very local spot, not touristy."
Thoughtful gesture,"I went to Moosehead with a longtime friend to catch up and celebrate her birthday. I requested in advance a candle on top of their cake and didn't know it was complimentary until I saw the bill. They even gave a free glass of Prosecco! Food was good. We particularly enjoyed the bacon with dates, cauliflower (sauce made it special) and pistachio cake. If you plan to go there, do make reservations in advance to avoid disappointment."
Deliciously casual,"Wonderful stuff, though a causal eatery the food here is world class with a fun vibe. Lunches can get ready busy so do go early"
"Terrible service, average food, misleading promotions","Heard good reviews and went with the intention of experiencing what the buzz was about. They had a promotion running with 1-for-1 for certain categories, and we ordered 2 mains, the octopus and flank.

Ordered some small dishes and drinks as well to support the place, ended up getting hit with a minuscule deduction to our small plate instead of our mains due to ‚Äúpromotion policies‚Äù, which were at no point communicated to us during our meal, nor were we warned about implication to our billing when we were ordering - even though we specifically quoted the promotion when we ordered.

Terribly inconsiderate service from the ordering up, and getting the policy book thrown to our face was a really wonderful experience.

Octopus was hard although admittedly well seasoned, same goes for the beef - not bad, but don‚Äôt get the hype.

Can not recommend in any sort of good conscience, there‚Äôs much better places to support for the competitive local dining and bar scene."
Eating with the locals,"Delicious Tapas style food,every plate that came out was sensational! The staff were very friendly and on top of their game, it was the dining highlight of our trip, thank you Moosehead, I will definitely be back when I visit Singapore again."
Poor service standards,"Hi moosehead

Your service standards is appalling.

I made a reservation at your place about one week prior to 1 may, and emailed you regarding some adjustments on that very same day.

Not only did you choose to ignore my email for the entire week, you decided to call me the night before 1 may (at 930pm) to inform me of your closure during the time slot I booked.

Your service attitude is disgusting.

Instead of apologising for the error due to your miscommunication with eatigo, and for the last minute disruption you caused me, you blamed eatigo for ‚Äúforgetting to mention that you were closed‚Äù.

Was it not your responsibility to check your reservations beforehand? Even then, my email on 25 April regarding my reservation should have raised a red flag - the email you conveniently chose to ignore.

I‚Äôve made bookings on eatigo before, and encountered restaurants who made changes to their operations for whatever reasons (after my booking). Never have I encountered a restaurant so tardy like yours, to inform me of the changes less than 3 days before my reservation - much less 14 hours before, as you did.

My reservation was meant for an important lunch appointment and your irresponsibility in this matter is utterly disappointing.

You provided me no alternative, nor an option to honour my eatigo booking at a date/ time of my convenience, and I can no longer make a reservation somewhere else for 1 may all because of your poor customer service.

I expected better from you."
A taste of Sydney in Singapore,"The Moosehead reminded us of a small bar that would not look out of place in Sydney, Australia. The cheese burgers were cooked to your liking and were quite tasty. We added chips to our meal and mine were a little salty, however my wife‚Äôs were fine. The meal was reasonably priced for Singapore. We would recommend a meal and quite drink at Moosehead‚Äôs, especially if u want a taste of Australia in Singapore."
"Very good atmosphere, food and service","Visited on a Friday night so it was quite busy but the ambience is upbeat and lively. Ordered the barramundi, beef, broccolini and ravioli - all were very well prepared and presented. The servers were extremely friendly and helpful. Prices are reasonable except for the beef. I would return again."
Mooseknuckle,"Went here last night and it was excellent. We had a mezze board and three small dishes, which was just the right amount. Each dish comprised simple fresh ingredients which perfectly complemented one another. A handful of sesame seeds, a drizzle of balsamic, a crumble of feta, a sprinkle of orange zest; you can tell that careful thought has gone into developing each dish. The prices are very reasonable when compared with other high end tapas style eateries in the area. The staff were very attentive and quick to replenish table water. The ambience was good with low lighting, background music and no air of snootiness. Would definitely return."
Cosy and delicious,No complaints at this cost venue with skill fully prepared dishes some of which will leave you clearing the plates because it‚Äôs so good. Simply furnish and cosy
Interesting dishes in a cosy place,"Had a quick dinner at moosehead with spouse, ordered brocolli and cauliflower as well as the beef, grilled specially medium well and medium rare half and half as we had different preferences.

Thanks to the very helpful wait staff, we had this arrangement. All in all a very pleasant dinner at moosehead."
"Fantastic Food, Limited Seating!",Moosehead is a place which I do go to for dinner quite frequently. I really like the quality of the dishes - they are all small plates but the food is delectable. Highly recommended!
Excellent little bistro with great food,The dates wrapped in bacon are a must-haves and so are the other mezzes. Great food in general but would be nice to have new menus every so often
Food is nice!,"Serves nice delicious food, but as the serving portions are rather small, so will need to order more dishes. Thus be prepared to a slightly costly meal. The small plates are much nicer than the desserts."
"Good food, bad service",Worst service I've ever seen. I practically had to run after the staff just to order a beer. They were even looking me in the eye and then just walked past. Was there for over an hour and they never came to my table once to ask me if I wanted another drink or more food. Food was nice though but they need to brush up on their speed.
Burgers in the middle of Chinatown!,"Even though we were in Chinatown, we were both craving a good-sized burger and fortunately found Moosehead Kitchen-Bar. Husband and I had beef burger and chicken burger with French fries. Very tasty. Owner (from Australia) took time to personally welcome us. Lunch price included 10% service charge and 7% GST, lunch total with Coke was S$52. We found prices in Singapore overall to be high. Restaurant located in a cozy, narrow old shophouse in the heart of Chinatown in Singapore. Lots of ambiance and good food."
Good with potential to be great,"This was probably the 5th time I visited the restaurant. Food was great but there wasn‚Äôt new dishes being introduced to the menu since the first time I visited the place early this year. Brought my Mediterranean friend there and his feedback was that the menu was standard Western cuisine with limited Mediterranean variety. That said, I always enjoy the standard of the food and appreciate the service rendered. Overall, I am satisfied with my experience. But I look forward to new varieties on the menu some day."
Nice and unique food,Went there with my friends and we were very pleased with the food. I especially like the dates wrapped with bacon. Staff were very friendly and helpful too.
innovative food,"beetroot wasnt as good as people said but their other mainstays delivered, from the broccolini to the cauliflower and amazing pull pork burger. chicken and reuben were unexpected stunners. it was very reasonably priced as well"
Good food and underated,I was introduce to this place by a colleague and you have to try the beef flank. It's so juicy. I would recommend the roasted cauliflower which tasted amazing too.
ALWAYS EXCEPTIONAL,"moosehead is the best restaurant in Singapore. Quality food, great vibe and wonderful service. I need to go atleast once a month. Lunch or Dinner."
Absolutely worth a visit,"Friendly staff, great vibe, fantastic food. Go on your own or with friends and you'll have a ball..."
Nice diversity,I really enjoyed this place for the diversity of the food. The taste and the quality are perfect. The only flaw is maybe the quantity and the noise around when it's crowded.
"Just when you think the food can‚Äôt get any better, the next dish arrives and leaves you speechless","Moosehead is one of those places which at first glance look like a normal neighbourhood pub. A little place with tables close to each other. But these tables are not empty. Place is packed with smiling, happy people. And you soon understand why. Just when you think the food can‚Äôt get any better, the next dish arrives and leaves you speechless - soon you are hoping it never ends: tzatziki, bacon-wrapped chargrilled dates, beetroot, cauliflower, pumkin ravioli. I mean, really: the cooks in this place are artists: creating tastes impossible to describe!"
Excellent food,"food is one of the best, especially the brocollini and the cauliflower. Although beer selection is too few"
Innovative and delicious combinations,"We have had dinner at Moosehead a couple of times and always found a delicious surprise on the menu. This time we had the artichokes (must have), the tuna tartare, and the torched cauliflower. The surprise was the baby barramundi with a delicious caper-tomato dressing. Service is efficient and friendly."
Average Mediterranean Food,"In general, their food is ok but a bit overpriced. Ambience and service are also average. We ordered the hummus with pita, half roast chicken and pork belly. The hummus is nice but I hope they served more pita along with it."
Found mead at your restaurant!,Dinner with my girl friend and found mead at your restaurant and it was awesome!! Food was fantastic and we had a wonderful evening.
