Food Capital CNY Buffet !,"Went to Food Capital for CNY Louhei lunch with business partners. Buffet was awesome. Good spread! The Laksa was Terrific! I had two servings, also convinced the non laksa eaters to try. And they love it! Thanks to the service crew at Food Capital@Hotel Grand Copthorne Waterfront. Cheers!"
Warm service with excellent food,"food is nice!! I love the oyster and Thai chili sauce,what is beyond my expectation is the warm service from Mr.Ibrahim he’s so nice and helpful!!
Thank you very much will come again"
Food is ok only,The buffet has variety and i like the different food choices. Food is of average standard for the high price. The indian food is not as nice the previous time when i ate there. The naan has more moisture and lamb biryani is not as tasty.
Good lunch,"First visit, ordered the buffet lunch. The pan seared seabass was above average. The signature laksa was good and the Chilean scallop was good too. The Australian beef rib eye was just average,a bit tough, luckily the portion was small to minimize wastage. Some of the tempura prawns were pretty good, very fresh.
Service staff cleared the used plates promptly.
Ambience okay and good customer service.
Members get 30% off, a good deal."
Food Capital Buffet dinner,"Friendly staff, wide spread of food - Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Western, etc. Must try Laksa with hum, roast pork, roast duck, roast beef & Chendol. Don’t forget to Join the Ala Carte rewards for 10% rebates."
Great Dining experience,"1st time visiting the place. Great food, great environment & services. Will visit the restaurant again."
Good service,"Service crew are all very attentive & prompt, thumbs up to the team. Variety of food not much but is nice, seafood fresh esp prawn & crab. A Cosy place to dine in with friends & family."
Food at Food Capital Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Although there wasn't much variety, I must say the food tasted great. My family enjoyed the crab and prawns which were very fresh. There was chocolate fondue and bingsu."
"Not the same level of food spread, quality and service as before!","It's weekend and so we decided we revisit this cafe for the buffet lunch that we last visited in November 2020.

The cafe is cosy, bright and spacious and as it is located at the side of Singapore River, facing Robertson Quay, the view and scenery is nice. And I will dwell too much in this aspect since my last review covered it.

The cafe was quite crowded since it's the school vacation!

The food spread was International, with a good spread of Western, Asian and local themed food and overall they were satisfactory.

Good Points:

Some of the delicious food included the curry fish head (fragrant and tasty), creamy spaghetti, steak, herbal chicken soup (lightly herbal flavoured), tempura items, seafood platter (fresh) and of course the pastries and bingsu ice cream!

Coffee, tea, ice cream and fresh cut fruits (but very limited) are inclusive in the buffet too.

Bad Points/Areas for improvement:

The roast pork was quite nice too, very crispy on the outer skin and juicy of the meat but it was too salty. The laksa was by right one of the popular items here but I found it ordinary and not as flavourful as it should be.

Although they served grilled salmon and fresh salmon and tuna, they did not offer sushi maki. Usually most restaurants will offer at least 2~3 types of sushi maki besides the fresh salmon.

The curry fish head was very nice and so it was one of the fast moving items and if you come late, they would be gone. And also the chefs did not replenish it but replaced with prawns! (of course with the same curry gravy) Usually they should prepare sufficient amount of fish heads to meet the needs.

And also the funny thing was that, braised ducks were hung at the food counter but diners were told that they were not to be served but for dinner? Strange, then don't hang there!

Overall, service staff were ok, i.e. clearing used plates but they were mostly part-timers like students and were not responsive even when we thanked them for clearing the plates. No expression on their faces too. And also the chefs were always MIA at the food counter, especially the noodles counter. So you would have to wait a while for the chef to come out from the kitchen or from another food counter to comeover. Probably on the day of our visit, there was a shortage of chef?

Value for money? Hmm, not really as we were paying like $54 per pax (after 30% discount given for M-membership or online bookings), and the food spread/variety and service level did not quite meet that ""amount"". In fact, for the past few weeks, we have been to several buffets and were paying much lesser and yet with much better quality/spread of food. In fact, we were a little disappointed on this visit as it was so much better back in 2020. (you can also checkout my earlier review here too)

While the dinning experience was ok, we would need more valid reasons to convince us to revisit again as we have better options to choose from in the coming weeks! So do stay tune!

Review for Food Capital,$82++ per pax but food varieties too little and don't taste good. This is buffet for adults and kids so it doesn't make sense there is only lime ice cream... I rather pay another $6 to go for the buffet at The Line @ Shangri-La or the buffet at Orchard Hotel which costs $88++...
Quiet corner to enjoy delicious a la carte menu,"When we were told that Food Capital was reserved for buffet customers only and we had to be seated at the adjacent Tempo bar to consume our a la carte order, we were a little disappointed.
Hello when we saw Tempo bar was consisted of high chairs and sofa seats, we were delighted to have the comfy sofa seats! Furthermore, the very welcoming and cordial service of asst manager Mr Nabil made us feel so good the entire evening with good selection of food ."
Disappointed with the buffet spread,Is not value for money. Won’t recommend. The spread was disappointing. Will not be visiting again. 👎👎
Great service & quality food selection,"The buffet lunch selection is fresh & tasty as always. CNY menu has sashimi Yusheng too. We get to enjoy our early mini lou-hei, so glad that we managed to squeeze in some space after such a sumptuous buffet lunch. We are most impressed by their great service at floor & food counters. Our recent experience with other hotel buffet has really put us off as most are struggling with minimum staff strength & high pressure environment."
"Delightful meal, even better service","Came for a staycation and decided to head to the restaurant on 21 Jan for dinner as

Whilst the restaurant was bustling (as bustling as possible under present circumstances) the food was excellent, and much better than we remembered it to be. Perhaps the a la minute preparation meant that dishes were prepared fresh and hot, which did wonders for the quality of the food.

As good as the meal was, the attentive, efficient and excellent service by Irfan and Wei Bin , as well as the restaurant's maitre d meant that our evening was that much better.

Thank you, team at the Food Capital, for a delightful end to the week. We'll definitely be back soon!"
Not bad for a buffet spread during Covid pandemic,"It was good to have buffet that you can get your food from the serving table instead of ala carte. Spread could have more varieties with that amount spent which was slightly more expensive than Mandarin Oriental and Pan Pacific. The turkey, chilled seafood, sashimi and tempuras were good, but the taste for the claypot dishes really needed improvement (too salty)."
Our new favourite.,"Have had dinner sitting outside twice in the last week.
A perfect setting on Robertson Quay, the other side of the river to the main bar / restaurant run, peaceful and you can actually hear yourself speak!
A varied menu including delicious meats / seafood cooked in a tandoor, my young daughter enjoyed the pizza.
Great and attentive service with the chef and manager both taking the time to come and have a chat.
Really enjoyed our evenings there. Will be back.
Thank you!"
Great service and food!!!,"Went for dinner and drinks recently with a group of friends. The food and service was great...
Thanks to Afiq and Dennis for the excellent service... the assorted veg and non- veg kebabs by chef Negi were superbly delicious.... highly recommended for all those who crave to eat authentic mouth-melting kebabs in Singapore....

Big thumbs up!!"
Great dining experience with the service and food.,Love the chilled-out settings and atmosphere. Food selections are adequate and the quality is good. Especially enjoyed the seafood menu which was fresh and sweet. Miss the good old days of moving around the buffet spread but the attentive and friendly service staff made up for an otherwise restrictive ala-carte buffet.
FOOD WAS DISAPPOINTING BUT SERVICE WAS CONSISTENT AND COMMENDABLE,"Our family and friends dined at the restaurant on 19 March. It is one of our favourite restaurants to visit over the last 2 years. It is currently serving Mediterranean themed buffet dinner. This time, we were disappointed with the lack of variety and taste. Apart from having enjoyed the half lobster (one time only) for each customer and the chili crab, the rest was a let down. The overall food served did not justify the pricing ($80++ per person) of the dinner. However, we were appreciative of the consistent good service received. The service team was personable, warm, friendly efficient and attentive. Special mention of the following staff: Jeefren (specifically), Steven, JC and Edwin. They took good care of us throughout the night. Thank you very much for your service from the heart."
"Not worth the money, food serving too little.","Not worth the money spent, food serving too little. Only plain water free, the rest of the beverage need to pay. This will be my last visit, will not recommend to friends and will advise friend not to patronise this restaurant."
Excellent service,Went there recently and the service staff were all very attentive. Changed our plates couple of time when they noticed it is full of prawn shells. The F&B manager Nair also gave us his food recommendation and even served us one that we didn't ordered which was a pleasant gesture. Overall nice experience:)
Director,"This is a good ambience place and good food Can come more time. Service is excellent! Staffs are best service like Gim, Jeefren, Mike:)"
My family and I had a lovely,"My family and I had a lovely lunch at Food Capital today, 30th Jan 2021. There was a great variety of food available, and we were serviced by an awesome team of staff. As we’re unable to help ourselves to the food due to COVID, the staff had to do a lot of the walking for us. Despite that, they maintained cheerful dispositions and were very friendly in their service. Nair Keshavan, whom we later found out was the operations manager, provided excellent service and brought us cheerful banter every time he delivered our food items. He was attentive to our needs and provided us good recommendations on what to order. Excellent presentation of the food served on our table as well, kudos to the chefs in the kitchen! Thanks Nair and the team for the lovely afternoon :)"
Christmas 2020,Food is very fresh & good. Our family enjoyed the atmosphere and meals. Awesome. Staff was helpful especially during covid restrictions (delivering food).
Nice ambient and food,"Food are nice especially the sashimi. Staffs are polite ,friendly and attentive. Restaurant is spacious and seat are well spread."
Nice Lunch Experience,Foods are good and tasty. Love the Ham. Seafoods are also great. Desserts are also great. Love the crispy ice-cream waffle. Recommend to go and try.
Lunch with colleagues,Went with colleagues for a Christmas lunch on a Thursday afternoon. Food was fresh and staff were friendly!
A lovely dinner experience,"We went for the newly launched ala carte buffet dinner and were wowed by the experience. It was definitely value for money considering the spread of the menu, quality of food and service.
Some of my favourites were the lobster bisque pasta, bbq lobster, prawns (both cold and BBQ), mango pudding, naan, mutton curry and ice cream on waffles. The lobster and prawns were really fresh.
The service staff were attentive, efficient and polite considering that the restaurant was almost full. Chef Pin also came by our table to check if we had any comments with regards to the food.
Kudos to the team led by Head Chef Pin for the delightful experience we had that night."
"Excellent Dinning Experience over food, ambience and service!","Formerly known as Cafe Brio, it has been at least more than 10 years since my last visit here and the cafe has undergone major refurbishments and now is much more cosy and nice than before. It's ergonomically designed, bright and neat.

We came by here for our weekend lunch buffet as the cafe had just reopened a day ago and we decided to give it a try again as we have been visiting other restaurants over the past few weeks. We were early, and the friendly staff ushered us to a waiting area where we could rest in the comfortable sofa seats while waiting for the cafe opening time.

The cafe was not that crowded, possibly due to the heavy showers outside and also it's reopening soft launch and many people may not have known yet.

Our decision of coming back here was a right one. And it didn't disappoint us but thrilled us instead.

The spread of food was nice with good quality, in particular, the BBQ grilled items. The seafood were fresh and the meats, well marinated and barberqued. The Stirloin Steak, Lamb Chops, Prawns and Mini Beef Burgers, among others were awesome! (Other items included sausages, squids, sliced pork belly)

Kudos to the culinary team headed by Chef Pin. Although it's generally a western food restaurant, it also offer some Asian and local food such as the Salmon sashimi, Grilled Salmon, Tempura Prawns, Pork Belly Bun, Stir Fried Clams and Veggies etc. There were also a couple of Indian dishes that we did not order from as we were just having curry the past few days and decided to skip them.

Maybe they could consider introducing some local delights or street food like rojak, popiah etc making it more balanced and cater better to local diners since well, there isn't any or more foreign guests.

Some food could be improved that included the Pumpkin Soup, it was a little sourish (usually it should be the sweet version) and the Spaghetti could be cooked a little longer and allow the selection of sauces such as sour cream, tomato puree etc and good to include some minced pork or seafood.

The desserts were perfect! Not only they were nicely decorated and made, they really taste great. The pastries and ice cream waffles were excellent, also got red bean soup (that came with gingko nuts), mango sago, berries etc. They also have the chocolate fondue with mesh mallows and fruits in skewers. Yes, the chocolate was very flavourful and rich in taste. When we placed the order, the skwers of mesh mallows and fruits came with already coated thick layers of chocolate. Usually, they were separated as some diners may not be able to take chocolate (or too much) and so on the 2nd round, we requested to separate the chocolate and skewers and the staff did so as we have senior citizens who do not have sweet tooth.

Coffee and tea were inclusive in the buffet too.

Service wise. Excellent! Staff, be it the manager or serving crew were friendly, polite, efficient and attentive in clearing used plates and refilling our iced water from time to time and also frequently came up to ask us if the food were ok and solicit feedback. The manager and a few crew were extremely humurous, cracking jokes with us and even initiated conversations with our seniors in dialects (though they were effectively bilingual in English and Mandarin). Even the Head Chef, Pin also came by our table to check if we were fine with the food.

In fact, the service rendered here is one of the very few that we have experienced in recent times, considered top notched and excellent! Credit must be given to the entire F&B team.

Also, we were told that we could walk around the food display areas to snap photos on the decors (but not able to pick up food from there, well, there wasn't food there), the first restaurant that allow to do so, considering the social distancing measures from Covid19. A nice and welcomed gesture!

Value for money? Yes, considering the spread and quality of food, nice ambience and great services. There was a 30% discount given in conjunction with it's reopening and we ended paying like $54 per pax.

And you can bet that we did enjoy our dinning here and will surely revisit again, and this time round, will not be over 10-year gap but more often. I hope the team here will keep up with the good work!

Highly recommended!"
Good Service and Excellent Food,"Attended the newly launched ala carte buffet on a Friday night, it was a full house and understandably the wait for some food items can be quite awhile especially the Chinese station, but overall the food was excellent and delightfully presented in suitable serving portions.

I have to especially mention Loreto whom is extra attentive and made things happen, he made our night more enjoyable, thank you."
Birthday gathering at Food Capital,"Enjoyable dinner with good food and good company! The chefs are friendly and helpful to us, creating new recipes and offering more than what we have expected. That’s why we are always back at Food Capital whenever we have friends or family gatherings."
Excellent staff and Great Food,The selection of the food was a huge variety and fresh. The staff were excellent and service was great. They were very attentive to all the guest.
Average,"The food here is not good if you are a vegan. Unfortunately, the staff do not understand 'vegan. We travelled to many places on holiday that were accommodating. Most places had vegetarian options that you could eat but here they don't have a separate vegetarian option section at all. For a five star hotel we found it only to beaverage. This was in stark contrast to their Grissini restaurant which was first class and five star which we absolutely loved."
Not that great,"The food is ok. I did like the roast beef. It was nice. The seafood, not so much. The variety of the food is only little and the dessert is a total letdown."
Christmas Day buffet disappointing and not worth the money,Christmas Day buffet was pretty poor. Seafood was mediocre with limited choice and meat quality was very poor - chewy and tasteless. No carbs or vegetables available. Desserts were ok but nothing special. Free flow wine was the best bit. Looked like it was good for those with young children as there was entertainment in the form of a balloon animal sculptor and Santa. Service and communication during and after booking was very good and it was reassuring to know the booking was secure. Would not recommend this place though.
Value for money!,"Good spread, great festive atmosphere, with a live singer and definitely a value for money buffet meal!!"
"The picture show crab legs, but is not existent","Dont be mislead by the ads, it shows crab legs, but it is not available. Call first to make sure. This place was great last year, but things has changed a lot lately."
Festive buffet a total let down,"Very very disappointing, with the poor selection and standard of food this time round. I would have rated it terrible if not for our previous positive experiences. We first went to the buffet in early 2017 (after a long hiatus when it was Cafe Brio and standards dropped drastically) as it was newly opened after renovations. We loved it and it became our favorite buffet restaurant once again. For the past two years, we would go few times a year, for special occasion or just because.
Alas, the standard was not maintained. When we last went in Oct, it was still relatively good. However this time round, it seems that the chef had gone for the holidays and there was no quality control over the food served.
The cold seafood selection was pathetic, with only prawns, scallops, clams and oysters. Staff was slow on replenishing the oysters. There was no crab or crayfish like before. The dessert selection was lackluster as well, nothing looked appetizing. No cold milk this time round at the drinks section. Even though it was a Sat night, there was no bbq grill.
Don’t even get me started on the taste of the food. Roast turkey was tasteless and the sauce was bland. The cranberry and apple sauce came straight out of a cheap can and was watered down. Baked salmon had no taste and the white sauce to accompany it was nausea inducing. Braised beef had a weird lumpy texture and tasted awful. The bread roll was stale and waffles tasted off as well.
The tastiest dish I had for the evening was the piping hot Singapore laksa. For hubby, it was the lukewarm cream of mushroom soup which he needed to add salt to it.
Luckily the sashimi was fresh enough, though the staff serving it was exceedingly stingy on the serving. Only three small pathetic slices for each serving. For the tempura section, the staff was missing half of the time, and the tempura prawn took forever to be out, after which all will be snatched within seconds.
What a joke to call this a festive buffet! It was a deplorable experience and we certainly didn’t feel festive after our meal. At the price tag of $88, it is definitely not worth it. Even with 50% promotion, I would still urge one to consider other better options out there. We definitely will not be back anytime soon.
An afternote: service is not up to hotel standard, one is asked to go to the counter to pay the bill, whereas at other hotel restaurants, the bill is served to you."
One of the Best Hotel Buffet in town!,Wide variety! Super delicious! Love the mix of different types of cuisines. Dessert station was superb too! Really enjoyed our dinner.
First time user for Chope,"Firs of all, this was my first time purchase from Chope. It was a convenient platform to purcahse great deal voucher before you travel to oversea. Will continue to buy from Chope again!"
Value for money,Staffs are nice and food quality is good. Although not much selections but value for money. Might attend again
Superb experience,"We got a 50% discount via eatitgo. For the price we paid, I can say that we got to experienced a very good deal. Food was delicious! There were sushi, roasted beef, chicken, desserts, cheese and a whole loy more. There’s Indian and Singapore cuisine as well. I didn’t notice a pasta section, though. Still, we enjoyed our experience eating there. Staff were all accommodating and respectful. We were treated as if we were all important guests. I will definitely recommend this to other friends and family."
"Great Variety of Food, Great Discount","Booked thru Eatigo and got 50% off for Sat Lunch buffet. Great variety of food. They have Western, Japanese, and Asian cuisine. For desserts, they have cakes, cupcakes, fruits and ice cream. Free flow of coffee and tea. Nice ambiance as well. Food capital is at Level 1."
"Non-stop Oysters, Shiok!!","80%-90% of dishes are of good quality. There are only a few dishes that disappoint. Oysters and prawns were outstanding. The clams, mussels and scallops were so so."
Excellent service and food.,Would definitely go back again. Not forgetting the value for money from the chope offer. Buying to making reservation was easy.
Great selection,"We stayed in the Grand Copthorne and had lunch in this buffet restaurant, it is a busy restaurant with lovely helpful staff. There is a wide variety of food from around the world and plenty to choose from. Very good"
We had breakfast in this area every day,"Very good selection for breakfast. We didnt need a smorgsbord luncheon & they do not have al carte menu, so we didn't participate in lunch. The bar does bar meals not a great selection & quite expensive we discovered."
Intergenerational Lunch at Food Capital,"It was a lunch outing with grandparents and kids. The variety of food at the buffet therefore was quite suitable. There was Chinese rice and meats / veg , Japanese sushi, sashimi and tempura, roast beef, Indian, and a good selection of salad and dessert. And then there was the table for fresh prawns and oysters.

I wish there were more options for hot noodles or pasta though.

But really, we were so filled up already...

I would recommend it . It was a pleasant and delicious lunch."
More variety,"So far so good ..Oyster a bit small Service team is good ,very attentive and smiling Baked salmon is delicious"
Sunday left buffet for birthday celebrations.,"As I had made booking, we were ushered to a table with window view. Service was good with staff always near at hand. Foodwise was okay, usual fare nowadays. There was no cilli crab, replaced with clams with chilli crab gravy. It didnt have satay, dirian nor macaron, which you will see if you had googled online. Guess these were removed with the 1 for 1 promotion."
Decent quality food and a good place for family gathering,Staff are friendly and the food spread are good enough to fill up your stomach. They have good ambience for gathering and enjoy their good selection of coffee offer on the buffet counter.
Decent buffet with good quality spead,Decent buffet with good price after promotion. The spead is normal but quality is good. Sashimi is fresh and cut when order. Tempura is fried on spot but prawn also finished fast. Other meat dishes is well cooked as well. Overall we have a good dinner.
lunch,had the buffet lunch here. food variety and quality is good but service can be improved. very busy crowd here.
Used to be better,"Service can be greatly improved. The guy serving the sashimi was stingy and grumpy. No trace of smile can be found on his face. We had to keep asking for more and his face turned blacker. Oysters refill was very slow and reluctant. There were only 2 oysters left on the ice and we had to ask for it to be refill. Come on, it's a buffet. Why so reluctant on providing the food? As for the oyster quality, it was disappointing. They were small and shrunken. It used to be quite decent. There was snow crab legs the last time I went there and it wasn't available this time round. That was also quite a bummer. Prawns were good though. Variety of the cooked food was quite alright with different cuisines. But I don't think I'll return again."
Great variety and space,"I really like that they have stations of different cultures' food: Indian, Japanese, Western, Chinese. You can really find something for every taste. Desserts are wide-ranging enough too, to cater to everyone. The kids always love the chocolate marshmallows. Despite the spread, the place is spacious, helped by the high ceiling and open space."
Enjoyable,Had dinner there recently and found that the place has been renovated. Food variety is good. There are even durians for consumption outdoors with additional payment of $15/-. Overall a pleasant visit.
Good atmosphere but busy staff,Atmosphere was excellent but staff were too busy. Food was excellent value with the ongoing promotions.
"Great Variety, Quality Food","Just went on 17th June 2019, Going back again on 20th June 2019. Love the variety and am going back again!"
Food Capital buffet,"Went for buffet lunch on a Thursday. Service was good, food selection was also good. Special mention regarding chef Madeline, who runs the place well! She was also attentive to guests, making sure they enjoyed themselves."
Mr wong,"food average, not as expected for the food for this pricing. sashimi serving so mean .. but service is ok"
A busy buffet,"Admittedly it was the weekend, so the restaurant buffet was very busy in particular the Japanese station where the chef was busy as the sashimi and sushi were flying off the counter. Fresh oysters, giant cooked prawns, tempura were all in great demand.
Once you have eaten your fill of starters which also include satays and salads, you could choose from the roast, or the Indian section or their laksa. In fact, just have a little of everything but do save some room for dessert."
Indian Breakfast Was great.,"lavish spread of breakfast, INDIAN Food was a GOOD , They have a ROBO to make omlette, a good attraction for kids and adults"
Surprisingly good selection and attentive service,Came here for the lunch buffet and was not disappointed. The laksa was good and the sashimi and tempura were decent. The other cooked dishes such as braised beef were delicious too. Good experience overall considering that most lunch buffets have a narrow spread.
Food Capital - Luch for 2,Only 2 type of Roast - Pork and Chicken. Pork is OK. Chicken too dry. Seafood selection limited. Fruits so so only. Tempura - the chef cook sparingly for Shisano fried fritters. Probably last time visit for me to this place for a long time.
"Nice place , nice food","Food variety was good . Staffs were attentive and helpful . As soon as you finished your good , they are around to clear the used plates which was helpful as we will always have ample space for new space for new plate of food."
Service was great with good sashimi variety,"I have to give thumbs up to the service staffs.. they were attentive and service was great. We were a group of 9adults and given a corner table. Sashimi selection was fresh and good, but the chef did not look happy due to the long Q. Other food varieties were limited but quality was ok for the price paid. Will go back again and hope the sashimi chef looks happier ;D"
Great service!,"We were a group of 22 friends celebrating the Mother's Day dinner buffet on 11 May 2019. As laksa wasn't on the menu that evening, I expressed my disappointment to Madeline Tan, executive sous chef, who was busy at work. She told me it wasn't on the menu for Mother's Day celebrations. Seeing how disappointed I was, she surprised me by having a bowl of laksa delivered to my table a short while later without further charge! On further requests by 5 of my dining companions, she arranged for 5 more bowls to be served, also without charge! Great initiative! At the end of the dinner, I remembered that a celebration cake was supposed to have been served but the original arranger had forgotten to include this. Again Madeline arranged for the cake to be brought to our table expeditiously. This was truly great service! The food spread at Food Capital is decent and tasty. Highly recommended."
Good if u r into desserts and cold dish food,we went on a weekday.Selection of cooked food available was really poor. Good to visit only if u r a dessert person or cold dish person.
Japanese special,"We went when they had some Japanese fair so there were more Japanese selections. Spread was decent but food was average. The sashimi server was quite stingy with the portions and oyster shucker was very slow, creating a queue at the seafood area that was annoying for people who are trying to reach the other shellfish"
"Oysters not fresh, long wait for sashimi, & some staffs with not very good attitude.","Went for their dinner this evening. When I went back I started to have diarrhea many times and feeling nausea. The oysters are not opened on the spot. It's all on a tray taken out from their fridge and they left there for quite awhile too. Their sashimi queue was very long,wasted alot of my time queuing and the portion was very little despite me telling them its for my family too. Portion for 3pax only had less than 8 small pieces of salmon. And once the salmon had some black spots. Most their chefs doesn't look very happy too. All putting on a unhappy face. Too many people too, probably due to the promotion, need to queue for some food. Very unpleasant experience."
Weekend lunch buffet,"Good job to chefs who put up a comprehensive spread as possible! We had a great time having Japanese, Indian & Western food. Usually only 1 craving section but they put 2 - roast lamb & beef. They reduced salad counter to only greens & condiments. I was initially surprised but favoured the shortage as I was filling my tummy with sashimi, tempuras."
A wide variety,Buffet spread was good. Fresh. Tempura was fried without the smell of oil. Quality good too. Service was good.
Good Buffet Lunch,Went to dine in during lunch. Buffet spread is amazing and always topped up. It was a busy lunch but staff were very attentive. Specially Dharwin who looks after our table. They also have value for money deals with different apps. Would be back for sure! :)
Great dinner buffet and lovely ambiance,"Had my birthday dinner here with my whole family. We booked via eatigo. The dinner spread was great. There were so much to choose, from appetizers and salads to the mains and dessert. I must say my favorite was the pasta.

The only thing I can complain was the size of the cheese selection. It was relatively small. But other than that the whole dinner experience was great. There was bottomless coffee and tea as well which summed up the meal nicely.

Would definitely be back here again."
Limited variety & not really child friendly,The variety of choice is not very wide no pasta /pizza selection. Children were given disposable container as bowl and no child size cutlery except for the teaspoon.
Had a good time!!,"We celebrated my son’s birthday with my family. The oysters were fresh, and so were the sashimi except that the Chef at the counter was kind of reluctant to give more portions. Loved the roast beef, my Son loved the roast chicken too. Towards the end of our night, the waitress served up a sliced of birthday cake for my Son which is a nice gesture! Considering that it was one for one promotion, it was value for money. Had a good time there."
Good international buffet,"I have been to quite a few buffet in my life and I find me eating almost everything on the buffet table (well, almost everything). Great table service as well by their staff."
Great Experience,it was a very good experience.. the food is very fresh... most serving staff very understanding n polite.... but the sushi cook customer service a bit undiplomatic... will recommend Food Capital to friends....
Yummy Local Food,"I was at Food Capital for their weekday lunch. There was not much variety but food was all right. The nasi bryani adn chicken rice was good. The chef at the wanton noodle soup counter was not very pleasant. He did not seem happy that he had to constantly top up the steamed chicken for the chicken rice as well as the chicken rice. On the other hand, the chef preparing the salmon and lady preparing the tempura were very friendly. The waiters were very attentive, they cleared the plates and cups almost immediately. The lady cashier was very pleasant and friendly."
Food & dessert was great!,"My family & I had buffet dinner at Food Capital last night. The food had a lot of varieties. The theme was international, including a sushi bar too. The ambience was very nice. Food was delicious. The dessert was even better. It had improved a lot since we last went in March 2018. We enjoyed ourselves very much. I would like to compliment Chef Kuok Long & Executive Sous Chef Madeline Tan for their hard work & warm courtesy. Keep it up! Thank you."
Quality average,"Most stuff offered were of average quality . Food Area, not seating , is small compared to the guests that use it for breakfast, esp on weekends . Indian breakfast elemnts were not good at all. Robot making omlettes is a welcome addition"
Lunch With Colleagues,"There wasnt large selection of food, but the food quality was fantastic. We had a great time, and enjoyed ourselves with the great food."
First Visit,Buffet style food but was tasty and fresh. Plenty of choices and different ethnic foods. Help yourself as often as you wish for one price. Very satisfied at the end of the evening.
Disappointing Friday Buffet Dinner,"One of their most attractive item was snow crabs but sadly, it was no longer available when I visited this evening. The seafood on ice was extremely pathetic with just mussels, prawns, the so-called baby lobsters (crawfish, I think) and one or two other kinds of shellfish, absent were the snow crabs and oysters. They had cheese baked oysters which were wiped clean and there was only an empty tray. How long they took to replenish, I don’t know because it should not have happened in the first place. I had been there on at least 5 to 6 occasions but tonight might be my last visit till they improve their menu."
Amazing breakfast buffet,"Food Capital within the Grand Copthorne Waterfront hotel has one of the best breakfast buffets I've ever experienced. It caters to a wide range of cuisines and the food is regularly replenished. One of the highlights is a robotic omelette machine that is not only a novelty but makes excellent omelettes. If that's not your thing, there is a chef on hand to make your omelette to order. The pastries were fresh and delicious, the coffee machine is superb and there is a good selection of hot and cold items."
Good food good spread,The food was good. Lots of variety and good quality. There could have been wider aisle space between the different stations so that it was not so cramped. Overall a very good experience
Good quality spread of food and nice ambiance.,"Good quality spread of food covering Asian and international cuisines.
It was the third time I had dinner here.

However, due to the festive season, the place is slightly over-crowding, especially along the food aisles caused by different queues at food stations. Replenishing of food trays are a little slow.

Probably will receive more attentive services during off-festive season."
Good Service and Nice Ambience,Took my colleagues there for gathering.. Its a very nice place for our staff gathering.. Happy with the discounts given by Chope.
Amazing Haidar!,"Haidar Talib is really Amazing!

We've been ala Carte members for over 20years now. Really glad that he is back with the Hotel.

He is very warm, merticulous and friendly.

He really brightens the atmosphere & is very efficient as well!

We always look forward to meeting him when we return to town & dine at food capital! ;)

Thanks for taking care of us on the 1/12/2018 this time!

Good service from Dharwin,"Such a very good spread with a lot of varieties of food. Dharwin is very attentive and always know our need, clear our plates fast. Keep it up!"
Sunday Buffet Lunch,"The sashimi is cut so thinly by the chef and was given 4 thin slices per portion. The ebi tempura basket is always empty and didn’t replenish quickly. Overall, very limited varieties. It’s not worth even at “1 for 1” price!"
"Food Capital, Grand Copthorne Waterfront","Food Capital, Grand Copthorne Waterfront. My husband & I are regulars at this restaurant. They had a Japanese theme last week and the selection of food was marvellous. We had the fresh seafood, varied selection of Tempura including Shishamo and good range of western food, beef station and very tasty mushroom soup. Chef Magdalene and Chef Long are both very creative and diners are therefore spoilt for choice."
Fall short as a 5 Star Hotel,"The buffet food quality is good but they stop replenishing the food 1 hour before closing. Dessert station would be the last station for the meal and surprised that the
lovely sweet stuff seen at the beginning were only good for the “kiasu” and no replenishment for those who approached the station after having the main.

I’m not sure they are 4 or 5 Star Hotel so I asked the waiter, he told me we are 5 Star Hotel Sir. With that statement I think they fall short as a 5 Star Hotel. The table was not set with cutlery and we have to get it from the “cutlery station”. In terms of service level they certainly have lots to catch up.

PS: birds flying in the restaurant....(see attached photo)"
Good ambience average food,"Food selection is not wide at lunch buffet, especially for Chinese dishes. Replenishing of finished items was also slow. The sashimi chef was not generous and sashimi slices were cut very thinly. Sashimi Tuna also finished very fast. Need more items for chocolate fountain and ice cream flavors limited to chocolate and vanilla. Staff were generally attentive and cleared plates very fast. Not worth for price paid."
Breakfast,Was not at all impressed by the breakfast buffet at this hotel everything was precooked and you had to get your own tea/coffee. For a 5* hotel you would expect them to bring tea/coffee to your table.
Satisfactory Brunch,Unlike other brunches ... the quality of the food was better even though the spread was limited. Loved the Mushroom soup especially and worth mentioning the dessert spread was great.
Why were we not given empty tables?,"We were looking forward to a pleasant meal as we had been there before with a bigger group. Unfortunately, this time around, it was an altogether different experience. Two things ruined the experience. First, we were given a small table for two *even though* there were obviously empty tables around us and other couples had been given bigger tables too. So when I politely asked for one of several empty tables, the waitress made a show of asking the captain, but the reason they gave was that they were fully booked. That was a JOKE because ONE HOUR LATER, the tables were still not filled. So we took matters into our hands and shifted to a bigger, empty table, but the waitress refused to serve us and gave us attitude. From her accent, I think she is from China. Truly unprofessional. Food was also... well, let's put it this way, even with the various discounts and vouchers, I think you can find better quality fare elsewhere. Seafood was not fresh either. Truly disappointing and it will be the last time we step foot in there. Save yourself a trip and go elsewhere better with more professional staff."
1 for 1 Buffet Dinner,Ambiance was good but the spread was so so. Not value for money. If they can increase the spread I think will definitely visit there again
Good service but buffet foods so so,"Selection of buffet foods can be improve , credit to service staff, they are attentive and clearing of plate very efficient, when you leave your table to get more foods, your dirty plates was clear , good job."
Great service staff-JC Tan,"Last night, my family and I were celebrating my youngest daughter birthday at food capital. My mother at age 81 was already unwell prior attending the dinner. Waiter, JC Tan was extremely helpful and attentive. He noticed my mother and showed great concern volunteering assistance when I told him it is alright. JC took initiative and provided paper napkins, plastic bags and bucket. During dinner, I noticed that JC diligence in his work attitude towards other diners too. He deserves the compliment of providing excellent service throughout the dining experience. Well done!"
