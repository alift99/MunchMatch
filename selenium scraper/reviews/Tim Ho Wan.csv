Don’t even try to compare this with the original in HK…,"This is my rating for the Waterway point branch but I don’t think it’s significantly different from other branches, right?

For those who are aware of the ORIGINAL tim Ho wan offerings when it came to Singapore years ago, the current version pales greatly in comparison. What I missed most of all was the liver Cheong fun which has been removed.

The prawn cheong fun is expensive, really, for an eatery like this. It may be good, but note that many other places today in Singapore can whip up a similar standard. That cheong fun costs the same as a bowl of steamed chicken and mushroom rice, which shamefully did not come with Hong Kong preserved sausage.

Service may be good but it can’t make up for the sad menu and disproportionate pricing of its items."
Definitely not worthy of a michelin star,"Went to great world branch. Very disappointed. Would be a great insult to the michelin star. We ordered the pork and century egg congee which was tasty but by no means world class. The one we had at Imperial Treasures was much much smoother but as this was half the price, we would still have given it 4 stars. The fried shrimp beancurd skin was too oily. We had shrimp dumplings and spinach and shrimp dumplings, both were slightly above average. Then we had the salted egg buns which were a disappointment. The filling were not quite solid as opposed to the usual hot liquid filling. It tasted grainy. You could actually chew on the grains. Then we ordered mushroom and truffle buns shaped like mushrooms. These cost about $10 for 3. All I can say is do not bother. I coupd not make out either the mushrooms nor the truffle taste. I would suggest that you try the ones at social place in Orchard. All in all, I would probably not bother going back. For this price tag of more than $50 for 2, it is only average in quality with a few items below par"
A sad surprise,The experience was OK. Staff very polite. They placed cutlery and hand wipes on table before food arrived. I used a hand wipe. My husband washed his hands and didn't use the 2nd handwipe. At checkout I was charged for the handwipes. The handwipes had no price on them and were not mentioned on the menu. The point is there was no indication they would cost the customer. Surely they can't charge without telling you beforehand.
Perfect Dim Sum,"We had a fabulous lunch at Tim Ho Wan. The Don dim was prefect, so delicious. We can see why they have received Michelin Stars every year. Wish Tim Ho Wan would open up a restaurant in Seattle, WA!"
Dim sum,Popular hong kong dim sum chain where you don’t have to queue up for now. The pork buns still great. The other items are ok. Ok service
Simply HK Dim Sum at its best!,"The One Michelin Star restaurant is great for business and family HK dim sum lunches. With a variety of good and affordable dim sum dishes that are favorites with both the old and the young, it is one of the restaurants to go if you want to embrace HK dim sum."
Worst Tim Sum In Singapore,Had lunch at Westgate branch. The quality and taste of the dim sum/food have deteriorated tremendously. The quality and taste are worst then those dim sum sold in coffee shops and hawker centres.
Restaurant Manager,"Went to this restaurant on 9th Jan 2022 with my family. The person who approached us as we lined up outside the restaurant was rude in his approach to us. I just brushed it aside as I did not want to ruin my Sunday lunch. Later when I was having my lunch, I heard a loud altercation between another customer and the same person. Obviously this manager has a problem that needs to be dealt with.

The food here is very good and the rest of the service staff are very nice. One of them told me they also have issues with the Manager when I tried to provide feedback."
On my list of go-to places again?,"I’ve frequented Tim Ho Wan since they opened their first outlet in Singapore but over the years could never find a reason - most likely grew tired of the same dishes.
I brought my family to the outlet at Jewel & was surprised that I pretty much enjoyed myself this time because my kids liked the dim sum very much!
Service can be improved though but overall it was a good experience.
Hope to see menu change so that there is a reason to go back again."
Good Food Good Mood Tim Ho Wan: World Renowned Cheapest Michelin Restaurant Most Famous For Its BBQ Pork Bun & Egg Tart!,Good Food Good Mood Tim Ho Wan: World Renowned Cheapest Michelin Restaurant Most Famous For Its BBQ Pork Bun & Egg Tart! #goodfoodgoodmood #timhowan #worldrenowned #cheapest #michelin #bestrestaurant #mostfamous #bbqporkbun #eggtart
Cantonese Cuisine,I had a lunch meeting at Tim Ho Wan at Plaza Singapura Mall. The restaurant is located in a prime spot opposite Starbucks. We had a short wait and were escorted to a nice table. We quickly ordered and within minutes our food was served. The dim sums were delicious. The menu is quite elaborate and the taste is quite authentic. We enjoyed a nice meal. Service staff was friendly. Food looked good and tasted good too !
Much improvement since last visit more than 2 yrs ago,"There has been much improvement in the quality of the food.
1) noodle with chicken fried - Good. Noodle fine and not sticking together. Not found in any other place.
2) Pork rib with yam rice - excellent. Good fragrance and tasty.
3) Fried carrot cake with prawn - Well fried. Excellently done.
4) sweet vinegar dumbling - less vinegar now, Better more soury with vinegar.
5) All others same as other places."
Disappointing service,"Go to waterway point Tim Hi Wan and have lunch there with family. Due to COVID-19 rule, we understand that one table can have only 5 people. My family have 6 people. We saw a sign saying ""for family more than 5, they will try to arrange side by side table provided have space"". During that time there are alot of table vacant and we request sit side by side. One table 3 people but they arrange us sit very far apart which actually there is another table at the side. When ask them why cannot, they say because later the safe distancing people will catch. I think the restaurant manager or whoever is the upper management must educate the workers there. According to COVIT-19 rules it state:
1) Family members can sit side by side table. So if more than 5 you can sit different table but side by side table.
2) family member do not need to have 1m distancing.
Since we are separate to far away table then we have to move around as we need to arrange food for the children. We have three children and they need help. They refuse to let us walk to the other table saying we cannot walk around. I was telling them if you put us side by side table then we will not have to do that.
We are not trying to be difficult but if your restaurant put a notice there saying can arrange sit side by side than do it. Don't put there if you cannot do it. And update your workers if your workers is not up to date on the rule for COVIT-19.
The 2 table I referring is side by side which no other table is near the 2 table. We have a disappointing visit to Tim Ho Wan waterway point."
Excellent table service,"The down to earth pricing has drawn good crowd at this popular branch. Signature dim sum dishes were very good. One trick Tim Ho Wan used was, to ensure dishes reaching the table were hot. It worked wonder. With the excellent table service, this branch is well worth the recommendation."
absolutely delicious but small portions,"I haven't tried Tim Ho Wan in Sydney and came across this place while looking for some lunch.
I ordered a number of dishes to take away and after a short wait everything was neatly packed ready to take away.
It seemed like a lot of food but most of it is packaging... the dumplings (and special lunar new year dumplings), spring rolls and beancurd rolls - all yumcha favourites were really good and I like that they included a decent amount of chilli sauce to go with everything.

However, if you are really hungry or a big eater this could get really expensive."
Pricey food with a small menu of selections,Signature dishes were good but the staples were not good. Small variety of food. Prices were on the high side considering the quantity of the food. Not good value for money.
Super small portion yet expensive,"I ordered take away fried rice and after tax they charged me S$9.10. I was so surprised the portion was so small for the price I paid. As you can compare from the photo, it's just a standard bowl size. It's less than 1/3 of the regular size. The waiter said this is a ""personal"" size. Besides, tastes is not great. Compare to WOk HEY their price is $6.8 yet it's tasty and three times the size of Tim Ho Wan."
Flashes of old Cantonese cooking ..so so only.,"I guess when a business expands to multiple international outlets being what they’re on about, it’s more than likely the original focus will be weakened... & sadly it’s also the case here- but with a the Singapore factor added for extra frustration!
Being obliged to exit back out into the shopping mall walkway because we ( apparently!) hadn’t waited in the ( non-existent!) queue ...only to be immediately (!!!!!!) ushered back in bespeaks of Singaporean idiocy of the 1st water.
Then handed a silly clipboard along with the pretty pictured ‘menu’ & obliged to “ tick( with a pencil the gets resharpened frequently AT THE RECEPTION DESK IN FULL VIEW OF ALL PATRONS...mmmn, Singaporean or what) one’s food order.

Does one presume the rationale for all this is because the Singapore staffers cannot manage to take any orders ?..oh no! Because having dutifully filled out the orders as directed..the waitress the proceeded to go through everything as if we, the clients were back in Kindergarten!
Most of the food was only a Facsimile of Good Cantonese ...glimmers showed such as the generously- filled & nicely cooked taro/ chicken dumpling fillings being far too wet ..shame .
Poor table service & being charged 10c each for the minuscule wet wipes added insult to injury.
You can do better."
Nothing special,Maybe one day long ago it was spectacular. Today it is just another Chinese restaurant. Is it bad? No. But I think it's residual-hype from some time ago. Plz give this review a thumbs up
Take out window for dim sum,"While waling back to my nearby hotel I saw a take out window for dim sum and gave it a try. I order 2 siu mai (total of six dumplings) Normally one gets soy sauce with dim sum, but they served chilli paste."
Dumping Cravings,"One of the best places to have a blissful plate of delectable dumplings. I swing in whenever I can. This one is the “Pork Dumplings”, they are delicately wrapped and filled with juicy pork stuffing, dipped in spicy hot sauce. Just too good, keep them coming."
Celebrating birthday,"I have been to the Tim Ho Wan's outlet at West gate when my daughter celebrated my birthday. Today, we came here to this outlet at Plaza Singapura to celebrate my son's girlfriend birthday.

I came with my aged mother of 80 years old. The restaurant is located at the first floor of the mall very near to the lift that leads to the basement car park where I parked my car. At least, my mother need not have to struggle with her weak legs to climb stairs to the restaurant.

The exterior facade of the outlet is impressive and well decorated. I remember my previous experience at West gate where there were inadequate seats and the few of us were squeezing at a table and I felt under pressure trying to swallow my food in that cramped place.

We had two tables of space for the 7 of us. We found it much more relaxing to be able to communicate well in this conducive environment. We wasted no time in ordering the Baked BBQ Pork Buns, the specialty food of Tim Ho Wan. It is a bit of sweet inside but fragrant and tasty. The shrimp Rice Rolls were delicious, soft and tender. The Pork and shrimp dumplings were also filling and the Yangzhou Fried Rice had much rich ingredients in it and fragrantly cooked. The crispy fried bean curd skin with shrimp was crispy and melted in my mouth. The soup noodles were delicately soft and tender.

We also celebrated with a birthday cake and the staff were accommodating and very helpful. The service was excellent and we felt bad using so many plates and bowls for our dinner.

It is no wonder that the restaurant was able to achieve the Michelin Star Award for the past few years and this can be attributed to the excellent service combined with excellent standard of quality food. And I understand it has maintained the reputation as the cheapest of all the Michelin star restaurants."
Authentic HK dim sum,"If you are craving for good HK Dim Sum but don't wish to pay fancy restaurant prices for them, Tim Ho Wan outlets can't go wrong. The menu may not be very broad but the selections are sufficient for the usual choices like char siew buns, chee cheong fun, etc."
Good for a quick meal,Consistent in quality and taste. Soup noodles are always a good choice. I like the sauce they make that is poured over the vegetable dishes.
review of service at THW,"I booked tale for 7 on 10 Oct. When I arrived, the staff mentioned that last order is 5.15pm. it certainly was not reasonable."
Dim Sum Dim Sum Dim Sum,"Authentic and delicious Dim Sum dishes. Although selection is very limited, it worth the value and price. The Char Siew Bun is a must-try!"
Delicious Dim Sum,"Great Dim Sum restaurant located inside Plaza Singapora. Reasonably priced dim sum and super tasty. If you’re in the Orchard Road area, I’d highly recommend it"
Worth a visit,"This is the world’s cheapest Michelin star restaurant, which makes it a place worth visiting. Food is great especially considering the price level (costs about the same as if you would eat in McDonald’s), but do not expect something you will get in fine dining places. Otherwise you will be disappointed. This is a great place in its own way and the food is delicious."
Delectable dim sum,"Tasty dim sum found here, especially their fried carrot cake and jelly dessert :)

This kinda Chinese delicacy tends to be very expensive - my bill came to nearly $20 just for 4 simple items!

It's better to visit with more people - to share and try different menu items. Do shop for deal vouchers too :)"
Service Standard Dropped,"Came with friend for dinner, took about 5 mins in the queue as we arrived about 5:30pm. Ordered Yangzhou Fried Rice, Pan-friend Radish Cake, BBQ Pork Rice Rolls, Prawn Dumplings and Prawn & Pork Dumplings. Food tasted nice. However, staff served food unwillingly. We even had to keep requesting staff to refill our tea."
Tim Ho Wan,"The must order dim sum include barbecue buns, pork ribs, mango sago, fried milk custard, century egg porridge and Ma lai gao. Really yummy! Hope the special fried rice and egg tarts can improve in standard though."
Disappointed,The dim sums were mediocre and the rest of the menu were disappointing Two of us in the group experienced stomach discomfort following the brunch meals We won’t go back
Fast and tasty,Joined a queue at about 11.30am but were seated within 15 minutes as the larger groups needed time to be seated. Quickly ordered and enjoyed excellent dim sum before tackling the stresses of Orchard Road’s shops
Awful food - poor quality - never going again,Very disappointed by this dim sum eatery that came to Singapore with such acclaim several years ago and still seems to generate queue. Well I won't be queuing again as I won't be going again. Truly awful food. Could not wait to finish and get out. Mistake!
"Food not to bad, service could improve","The BBQ pork bun is a must try. So to the fried bean curd skin. Had also tried the egg tart, carrot cake which were alright. Service staff tends to be more grouchy - perhaps due to volume of people."
Terrible Experience!,"Hi, we went around 2.30pm. However, service was very slow. Staff were not alert and had to wait a long time for them to refill the tea. Also, food was not as yummy as expected. Total dissappointment!"
Good choice of Dim Sum,A quick lunch to try out their Baked BBQ pork buns. It does worth to wait for it. Taste was sweet n crispy different and no where to find this apart from them..
Super Yummy,"Super taste for the BBQ Pork Bun. Must try one! So crispy, the bbq pork crush and melted in your mouth, so juicy. The rests are average. Prices are medium, but worth it for us. Clean table and seats, They have any breakfast set in the morning. Coffee with bbq pork bun."
Great food without great services,"I had to wait for a while for my orders cuz it was so busy. Actually im addict of bao cake and chicken feet here.

Dimsum was just so so

But if you are busy and in rush, here is not a right place to be."
Good Food & Service,"Despite the busy high tea/lunch, period. Staff was attentive and reacted promptly to customers who needed assistance. Explained on the usage of promotional vouchers very well too when asked upon. Will definitely visit again."
Superior Hong Kong Style Dim Sum in Singapore,"At first the queue looked daunting but the longer wait was for larger groups whereas as a couple we were seated in less than 10 minutes even on a Sunday around 1pm.

It was one of the best value Michelin Star meals we have enjoyed.

Tasty hot food. Creative dishes. Fast service."
Long wait,Like the dim sum here but the queue can be a bit turn off. Order the char Siew bao which was my family’s favorite and the Chee cheong fan. Decent food.
enjoyable dim sum,Service has been fast and food experience has been great.Covenient location to dine. Quality of food is a favourite but table seating was a little squeeze.
Excellent dim sum,"We were in Singapore and in need of a last second purchase (having forgotten to pack something), so we found ourselves at Plaza Singapura. Having shopped around lunch time we stumbled upon this place, noticing it because of the long line to get in. So we gave it a try. I frankly think it was better than Din Tai Fung, where we had dinner (and which is more famous). Great dumplings and soup. The dumplings were delicate and all of the flavors sang. Really glad that happened by this place."
Yummy Tim Sum,Authentic mouth-watering Tim Sum (touch the heart) from Hong Kong. Great ambience in the heart of Orchard Road .. Singapore Shopping Paradise.
Amazing Dim Sum,"Searched out this wonderful Michelin Star Tim Ho Wan eatery chain while in Singapore. The original in Hong Kong is small with long queues in the street. This was larger, with quick seating and excellent service. All the Dim Sum we tried was very tasty, but the standout is the signature Baked BBQ Pork Bun. A must try any time of day while in Singapore."
Dim sum,"This is 1 of the Dim Sum food chain. This is not the first time we have eaten in Tim Ho Wan but the first time in this branch - PS. The food is generally the same as other outlets. Some Dim Sum are generally good but some dishes I dont have it so much, e.g. chicken feets etc.

Overall, if u like to eat Dim Sum, u can consider this place."
TERRIBLE! I We got diarrhea from having THW food!,"I had this in the afternoon before my midnight flight, ended up frequent to the toilet in the plane for at least 5 times! My other half had the same too and the common food we had was THW @ PS. I hope AVA or the authorities can check on the cleanliness of this restaurant. The food was yummy but I didn't thought (at first) that this was the cause... Horrible experience, will NOT frequent again."
Steam food is good,"We enjoyed the steamed food there. The dim sums which were like gyozas were deep fried though so that was on the heavy side, did not like it. Very quick service, handy."
Nice meal of dimsum,"This place is great for breakfast and it serves a good variety of dimsum, their buns are amazing and you can almost find your favourite dimsum here too. Their quantity is abit small and they are actually really expensive. But their standard of food makes up for it. I wouldn't eat every time but once in awhile."
Those buns though,"Your standard dim sum restaurant. Personally, I feel that there is a lack of variety as compared to other dim sum restaurants but their quality makes up for it!! A must try is their baked BBQ pork buns"
"Love the food, hate the service!",Im a regular and love the food! Keep coming back... but the service isn’t friendly and they have no attention to hospitality. Im traveling with bunch of kids.
Decent meal,"I have tried many Tim Ho Wan restaurant in the world but I was quite disappoint with THW Orchard, Singapore. The food have the same flavor but not really hot even cold. nothing to comment about the service, just about food. please pay attention because you are one of famous dimsum brand in the world."
Shorter queues now,"Dropped by for a quick bite, only possible since the queue is shorter now. The bbq pork buns are still tasty, everything else still average"
Great pork dumplings,"We have tried the restaurant chain in Hong Kong and Melbourne so felt we needed to see why it was like here. In the Plaza Singaporean’s, we only lined up for a short time but had been able to order before we went in. Staff very efficient and all the dishes were good. We did keep the pork dumplings to last but loved the food and sauces added well."
Food,Hot Food served fast. Siew mai shrink in size. Shrimp rice insufficient prawn. Congee bowl size shrink.
Great,"Great food, good price and service. Fantastic Hong Kong Dim Sum, among other things. Dumplings and Rice Rolls are great too. And do not forget the steamed sponge cake to finish."
"Food average, Service bad!","Food was average, if inot having discount coupon it's definitely not worth visiting. The Cantonese speaking lady cashier (might be the lady boss or from HK) really made us angry. No eye's contact, black face (maybe don't feel good knowing that we're using coupon) , when we confirm had our Chope reservation been noted, she sound & presented to be so irritated! What a service!"
Love this Dumplings,"On my visits to Singapore, I stay near to the mall and I occasionally eat here as the food is totally delicious and very tasty. However, one can wait for a while to be served as it’s an extremely popular restaurant, so go early!"
Staff is terrible,"Good job, THW PS staff! This is the last time we are going there! Bought a voucher fr Chope and happily went to eat some dim sum there. The staff did not see that the voucher was successfully redeemed or not and requested to see fr my Chope app. My app suddenly couldn’t load at all and the staff finally can see that the voucher was successfully redeemed from their end after a few minutes. I was feeling a bit relieved because I need to bring my son back for a nap soon. BUT, that was just the start of the trouble! The staff asked if I just bought the voucher. Not knowing what she was going to imply, I answered innocently and honestly that I bought it quite some time back. Then the staff said that we could have used it before somewhere else or some time ago and that’s why it showed ‘redeemed’! What an insult! We did not come to eat free meal! When finally my Chope app can load, it showed that it is redeemed on 2nd November 2018, the staff took a photo of that and still said ‘Can I have your hp number so that I can reach you if there’s any problem?’ Hello??! What’s the problem here??! I already showed u that it is redeemed on 2nd November. We dine at 3.30pm. Don’t tell me u suspected I came in the morning and used the voucher already???!! Please!!! The voucher is only valid for use from 2.30-5pm and only valid at Plaza Singapura outlet! Or did I come at 2.30pm to redeem the voucher and u just couldn’t recognise me bcos that was 1hr ago??!! This is super ridiculous! We walked in happily and came out feeling so insulted and angry! Dun say 50%, even if u give me free meal, I’m not going back there anymore!P.S. Just realised that before merchants can click proceed to redeem any Chope vouchers, there is actually a ‘valid’ word shown on the merchants’ app after entering the redemption code to show that the vouchers have not been redeemed before."
Very poor service,"I went to THW Plaza Singapura branch last Oct. 26, around 5:30 pm. You check the items you want on an order slip and call for a waitress to pick up your slip. I was very difficult to get the attention of a waitress to pick up the order slip. Not just me, but several other customers had their hands raised some flailing, trying to get the attention of some waitress or other. Ijsut ordered 3 things: har gaw, chicken-mushroom rice, and cold water. The water cam and it was hot, not cold. When i pointed this out the waitress said she'd change it, as if she was doing me a favor, as if I had changed my mind or tiicked off the wrong box. The har gaw came and it was OK. the rice with chicken-mushroom never came. Turns out they did not input that item into the computer. I went to the cashier and pointed out that this third item never came. She merely said so you don't want ti any more? No apology. Just rang up the cash register and presented me my bill. They supposedly got 1 Michelin star in the original restaurant in Hong Kong. This branch is a disgrace to that original restaurant."
Value for $ with Chope 50% discount vouchers,"Tim Ho Wan has established its reputation in Dim Sum. Therefore having a decent, relaxing tea-time/meal at THW was a steal with the Chope vouchers, although the timing was meant to be during off-peak hours."
Average food,Food was ok not fantastic. service is not good. Staff very unfriendly. When you ask them questions they answer in a way like they is not very happy that I ask them question.
Our favorite Dim Sum restaurant in Singapore,"Our favorite Dim Sum restaurant in Singapore. Everything was fresh and good and it was very affordable.The staff is friendly and helpful. Makes you feel welcome. Food served is fast, minimal waiting time."
Delicious Dim Sum,"Delicious Dim Sum. Portions are small enough if you are alone. Must order the crispy bbq pork buns, spinach dumplings and turnip cake."
Dim sum lunch,"I was told by a friend about Tim Ho Wan. I enjoyed the steamed egg cake, baked bbq pork bun, spinach dumpling with shrimp and traditional steamed pumpkin. We had decided to buy the special
mooncakes too. I will recommend this restaurant to my foreign friends."
Over rated,"We were told this was the place. Very disappointing. Service very bad, 10 mins between first and last plate. Would not recommend!"
Some winners in this HK-based dimsum chain,"Even in their branches in Hong Kong and Taipei where we have had meals, the following items are worth a trip: barbecued pork buns, salted egg sesame buns, glutinous rice in lotus leaf, cheong fun.
Affordable, casual.
Service, though, is not the best. Still, not a bad meal."
Over rated and cleanliness needs to improve,"Ordered century egg porridge ...it’s the worst that I ever had in my life. Spinach dumpling was a bit too salty. At a first glance all looks all right but while eating and observing, the cleanliness of the entire restaurant just completely turns me off. I think it’s over rated and i believed there are better dim sum places than this. Will never come here again."
"Overpriced, unremarkable food","I should have checked the review before spending good money on eating here. It is located just at the start of the mall's major thoroughfare in a rather unenclosed space, with tight tables where you can eavesdrop on either tables.
Price is on the high side for the puny portions. What's unremarkable are the porridge (bland, no ingredients), chee cheong fun (unadorned and boring), bean skin wrap (starchy salty sauce) and hot water tea which is supposed to be Chinese tea. Free egg tarts for us because we were the first 100 patrons wasn't extraordinary considering this is a restaurant with Cantonese roots. The only thing worth mentioning is the deep fried glutinous rice balls with salted egg yolk that is light, crispy and delicious.
If there is a negative rating for value for money, I would have ticked it."
Great intro to dim sum,"We ate here twice as this style of food (dim sum specifically) is not available in our Canadian city. Very delicious and plentiful - extremely well-priced for the quality. We enjoyed the baked bun with bbq pork and the pork dumplings in hot and spice sauce were a hit, as was the spicy prawn sauce char siew. The restaurant is crowded and we shared our table with others who were kind enough to engage in conversation and advise us on what dips/sauces went best with what dishes. The staff are very responsive when we added to our order mid-meal. We left the restaurant very sated and the total for 7 dishes and 2 drinks including tax and service was the equivalent of $35 CDN for two people."
Good yum cha restaurant at Tim Ho Wan,"Came here with the family a few days ago, and had some yum cha for lunch. They all really enjoyed their lunch (see photos), and I had the fried rice. I found the portions small, but the quality is amazing. The staff are great and helpful, understood our English. Good place to dine at."
Inexpensive and really good,"I'm not sure I'm rating the right location, but this was supposedly the Star Michelin restaurant. Each order is really cheap, but they can of course add up when you have 6 or 7 of them, and you are tempted to sample each one, and then reorder the ones you really like. Most of the orders were delicious, with some clearly the best dim sum I've ever had. The food also came really quickly. The one down side was that you had to wave down the servers, which is not great for a supposed Michelin Star, but they were wandering around enough where it wasn't a real problem."
Good start,Had breakfast here and it was rather good. The prawn hakaw and the fried dumpling with crab meat were my favorites. Decently priced too. The opening time is 11 am. Wish it was a hour earlier to brunch before heading to the shops. The sour sap juice was nice to wash the dim sum with
Michelin-winning dim sum,"Though it's not this outlet but it's original outlet in Hong Kong that won the Michelin star, you can still find rather good quality dim sum here in this Tim Ho Wan outlet. Despite being open at this venue for years, there is still a long queue to enter when we arrived at 7pm on a weekday. We decided to walk around a little and returned at almost 8pm and was able to get seated immediately. When we left at 9pm, the restaurant was still almost full-house.

We found that while many of the traditional items (such as the chee cheong fun) are not as well done as some traditional restaurants in Singapore, but they do well in their hit items such as the crusted char siu bao, the chilli crab dumplings (not really spicy but the crust is nice), the carrot cake and the recreated siew mai. Strangely, the traditional siew mai tasted only half as good even though the prices are the same for both.

Everything probably tasted better because we were famished and all their items were served piping hot! And make sure to order the right items!"
Not The Best Dim Sum,"As a picky eater that grew up in a very selective eating family, I find it super overrated to spend any penny on dim sum that the quality is easily beaten by dim sum restaurant around my neighborhood. I have tried it twice but the taste of dim sum still couldn't satisfy my craving for dim sum. Always wondering why people willing to spend the time queuing up for food that is not equivalent to the value. Anyway it's just my 2 cents. Peace."
"Small portions, large tariffs","Almost every item is in miniature, thought we were in Gulliver's Land! There are better eateries around and, provide adult sized portions. The congee was especially sad, hardly any ingredients, watery and extremely salty but tasteless. Occupying a prime position, it tends to get busy. Then again, you can only fool evetybody once."
Good Dim Sum,My daughter and I arrived very hungry mid afternoon on a Sunday in a pouring rain. We were seated right away even though it was busy. Seemed to be all locals dining. Our order arrived quickly and we enjoyed everything we ordered though I couldn’t tell you now what anything was. Fun to see what the locals were eating that we weren’t brave enough to order!
Favorite,I highly recommend - food is likely to satisfy anybody's palate. Their famous baked pork bun is forever my favorite and their beef ball is a must try too
Pork bun size shrinked,Packed the pork bun home and was shocked to see the size of the bun reduced! But they still charge the same price. Feels cheated.
Best Pork Buns In Singapore,"There is a lot of reasons to say that this restaurant lacks ambience and warmth. The tables are tight, the service staff is efficient but not what might be considered as service focused and warm. The Dim Sum options are all good, and no concerns about anything ordered. The reason to go back is the best Pork Buns I have eaten in Singapore. They never disappoint."
Nothing Special,Food: Average dim sum quality but nothing special Service: Standard cafe-style service Ambience: Noisy
Very good food but lack ambience and service,"Great location at almost entrance of level 1 of Plaza Singapura .
The tables are close to one another .
There is a semi open plan kitchen .
Service staffs lack smiles on their face .
We went at about 10.30 am hence not long queue . But restaurant are fully occupied already.
Dim sum skin is very transparent and soft . BBQ pork bun , rice Cheong Fun , glutinous rice are all very delicious
Reasonable pricing
High level of standard as far as food is concerned
Much room to improve in terms of service and ambience"
Fantastic Chinese food in nice environment,We ordered a mix of dishes and everything was very tasty and good. Very good service! A lot of new dishes.
Tim Sum are popular,"This restaurant at Pacific Plaza in Scott’s Road and the one at Plaza Singapura serves very good Tim Sum.
Must try is the deep fried Char Siew Dumpling (barbecue Pork). It melts in the mouth the moment you bite it.
The Prawn wrapped in Vermicelli flour is good too, so is their Siew Mai & Har Guo (Prawn Dumpling). There are quite a variety of choices and all are tastefully good.

Best of luck eating.
Ad."
Tasty Dim Sum,"There’s always a line for lunch especially after 12:30. Seating is prioritized for parties with all guests. The tables move pretty quickly, so we didn’t have to wait long. The sim sim variety is not vast, but everything on the menu is delicious! Try their specialty char soy bao!"
Good TimSum,"I love the Tim Sum here and it is affordable. However, the service at this branch is not up to standard."
Over-rated Dim Sum Place,"Not so sure why Tim Ho Wan received so many awards or why people praising so much about this restaurant. Service was so typical Hongkong (aka Not Friendly, Waitresses not displaying warm gesture / smiling to the least). Food was just average to my tasting."
Quick Munch at Tim Ho Wan,"It has been awhile since I last dined at Tim Ho Wan restaurant. The good news is that the queue are not as long as I had previously experienced....but the better news is that the food is still great!
I loved the Hong Kong porridge (香港艇仔粥). It is served with crispy fish skin and fragrant spring onions. Cooked in the porridge are cuttle-fish, peanuts, pork maw, jelly-fish, sliced fish and deep fried pig-skin. Delicious!!!"
Great food!,Very nice food! Do try the dim sum! It’s definitely good! Been addicted to it! Queue is the down side as it tends to wait for a while. Nevertheless don’t miss out the Custed bun and siew mai!
Amazing pork buns,"Visited for lunch, it’s a fairly limited menu, but the famous pork buns lived up to their billing. Very, very good."
Best Pork Buns ever,"We had been on a mission to find the best pork buns in the Orchard Road precinct and we found them here at Tim Ho Wan.

Crispy coating with sweet meat, we also loved the chilli oil dumplings. Amazing and wish we lived in Singapore so we could have them regularly."
Tim Sum Dishes especially Char Siew Dumpling (deep fried),"Been to this restaurant quite a number of times. Highly recommend for the above Char Siew (BBQ pork dumpling) Bun and also many of their steamed dishes. Ask fellow Singaporean diners if you happens to be there, (if you are a foreign tourist), they will sure to help recommend the various nice dishes. I will recommend Spinach and pork dumpling, fried carrot cake, prawns or Char Siew (BBQ Pork) wrapped with Vermicelli flour & topped with their special soya sauce, Steamed Siew Mai (minced Pork mixed with prawns)dumpling, Prawns Dumplings, their soups are also nice. Many choices including deserts."
Chinese Delight,"A good place to eat if you are in a group of four or more and Dim Sum is your do do. The food is good and tasty. Expect noise and bustle, but do your own thing and it all worrks out. Value for money."
A good experience,"Overall the experience was positive. Highlights were the shrimp dumplings and the spicy pork dumplings. I also ate the vegetable and prawn dumplings which were good and a portion of vegetables which were average. Given the choice of places in Singapore I think this is somewhere I would do occasionally- but versus options in china town for dim sum and also hawker options and din tai Fung then it’s a good to do, not a must do"
Cheap and good,"We visited their outlet at Katong 112. At 11 am, it is quite and no queue. Service is fast and food is piping hot. Their famous heavenly four are: BBQ pork buns, Fried turnip cake, steamed egg sponge cake and vermicelli roll with pig's lever. The Hong Kong style wonton noodle is also delicious. Four of us shared 10 dishes, which we could hardly finish all the food, at $15 per head only. It is much cheaper and greater value for money compare to Din Tai Fung. Highly recommend."
Nothing Special,"New Years Eve and it was crowded, we waited for about five minutes and was seated.
we had six dishes, the usual Dim Sum eats and the food was ok. My wife showed me a poster that siad, it is a Michelin Star eatery...but we found it to be lacking in taste. The seating was very cramped felt uncomfortable. Service was ok, Price wise, it came to S$34.25. Pretty Cheap."
Disappointing,"Heard lots is good story and read the review! It seems good.

However, our visit wasn’t fantastic nor even near to comfortable dining. The staff were rude and they don’t care, too many staff and took them 20mins to take our order.

When the food were served? The waitress just dump it on our table. Seriously? If I dine at the back street like at Hong Kong? I will accept it. This is a Michelin’s star restaurant? LOL..why is there a need of service charge? Food for thought!...

Food is average and our mood wasn’t great to have it. Before you can finish your food? Waitress come to clear our plates..wth?

Ok, just 1 try and go figure."
"Good service, good dim sum","Can't say it's the best dim sum, but it was the best in a long long while. The siew bao was good - I prefer the steamed version which this dimsum chain doesn't offer - and the cheongfun, chok cuon, glutinous rice and goji berry in othmanthus flavour jelly dessert very good.

Crowded, but we were not rushed, and service was friendly. We didn't order our dishes at one go as preferred here, and instead ordered as we went. No dramas.

Recommended!"
Good and Hot Serve Dim Sum,"Read the review not so good for THW for Plaza Sin, just try it this early morning 9.00am (1st customer) haha, in fact is Good for us. Price sure is not cheap because is THW. Dim Sum serve very hot and very fast. 👍"
