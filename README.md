# MunchMatch
 
A project developed as a submission to the National AI Student Challenge 2022.

MunchMatch aims to allow Singaporeans to select and choose their ideal restaurant with ease and confidence. 

The core feature behind this web service utilises SGNLP's Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis model, along with TFIDF keyword extraction to aggregate and extract key attributes from large collections of customer reviews, providing users quick access to an objective representation of the best attributes that each restaurant has to offer, without having to scroll through numerous reviews themselves.

MunchMatch offers a user-journey designed for speed and ease of use, first providing users with a search engine that is used to suggest relevant restaurants based on a short description of what they the user may be looking for.

The relevant restaurants are then displayed in a grid, along with their best attributes as identified by the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis, as well as other useful information such as rating, price range, and cuisines offered. This succinct summary of restaurants provides plenty of information to aid users in making their decision.

Lastly, MunchMatch also provides users with the option of performing side-by-side comparisons, allowing even the more indecisive eaters to find their ideal dining occasion.
